President Donald Trump lashed out at Don McGahn on Saturday, tweeting that he was “Never a big fan” of the former White House counsel amid an ongoing battle between House Democrats and the administration over documents and testimony related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration,” the president wrote online. “Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!”

The broadside follows a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal that McGahn rebuffed a request from the White House last month to publicly state that he did not believe the president obstructed justice when Trump ordered McGahn to seek Mueller’s firing in June 2017.

According to the redacted version of the special counsel’s report released by the Justice Department in April, Trump instructed McGahn to inform Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller must be removed. McGahn refused Trump’s subsequent request to refute press reports of the president’s directive, according to Mueller’s report.

McGahn, who stepped down as the White House’s top lawyer in October, was one of Mueller’s most prolific witnesses within the upper echelons of the Trump administration. But on Tuesday, he refused to comply with a congressional subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee to produce documents having to do with Mueller’s probe, deferring to the White House.

The committee’s subpoena also demanded that McGahn testify publicly on May 21, though it remains unclear whether he will appear before the panel.

Trump told Fox News last week that McGahn should not testify before Congress, and previously denied in a tweet last month that he charged McGahn with ousting Mueller.

“As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so,” the president wrote online. “If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.”

In a tweet earlier Saturday, Trump blasted Democratic lawmakers who “only want to talk about Obstruction” after Mueller’s report found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election.

That message was one of nearly six dozen tweets or retweets posted to Trump’s Twitter feed Saturday. The president spent several hours at his Virginia golf club before returning to the White House in the afternoon, according to pool reports."
Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country,https://www.politico.com,"['Alex Thompson', 'Marc Caputo', 'Burgess Everett']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/11/warren-west-virginia-2020-1317611,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station on Friday in Kermit, West Virginia. | Craig Hudson/Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP 2020 elections Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country The liberal firebrand draws nods and even a few cheers on a trip through rural West Virginia.

KERMIT, W. Va. — It was a startling spectacle in the heart of Trump country: At least a dozen supporters of the president — some wearing MAGA stickers — nodding their heads, at times even clapping, for liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren.

The sighting alone of a Democratic presidential candidate in this town of fewer than 400 people — in a county where more than four in five voters cast their ballot for Trump in 2016 — was unusual. Warren’s team was apprehensive about how she’d be received.

Story Continued Below

About 150 people gathered at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station to hear the Massachusetts senator and former Harvard professor talk about what she wants to do to fight the opioid epidemic. Trump-supporting college students in baggy t-shirts, housewives in pearls, and the fire chief dressed in uniform joined liberal retirees wearing rainbow “Persist” shirts and teachers with six-figure student loan debt.

Kermit is one of the epicenters of the opioid addiction epidemic. The toll is visible. The community center is shuttered. Fire trucks are decades old. When Warren asked people at the beginning of the event to raise their hands if they knew somebody who’s been “caught in the grips of addiction,” most hands went up.

“That’s why I’m here today,” she said.

Warren entered the room from behind a large American flag draped in the station. Roving around a circle of people seated in fold-out chairs, she tried to strike a tone equal parts empathy and fury, while avoiding pity. She went full prarie populist, telling people their pain and suffering was caused by predatory pharmaceutical barons.

The 63-year-old fire chief, Wilburn “Tommy” Preece, warned Warren and her team beforehand that the area was “Trump country” and to not necessarily expect a friendly reception. But he also told her that the town would welcome anyone, of any party, who wanted to address the opioid crisis. Preece was the first responder to a reported overdose two years ago only to discover that the victim was his younger brother Timmy, who died.

Preece said after the event that he voted for Trump and that the president has revitalized the area economically. But he gave Warren props for showing up.

“She done good,” he said.

Others agreed.

LeeAnn Blankenship, a 38-year-old coach and supervisor at a home visitation company who grew up in Kermit and wore a sharp pink suit, said she may now support Warren in 2020 after voting for Trump in 2016.

“She’s a good ol’ country girl like anyone else,” she said of Warren, who grew up in Oklahoma. “She’s earned where she is, it wasn’t given to her. I respect that.”

But Warren didn’t come to rural West Virginia primarily in search of votes. The tiny state likely won’t decide the nomination, and is all but certain to back Trump in the general election.

Instead, Warren was here to try to send a message that she’s serious about tackling the problems of remote communities like this one.

The “opioid war” is a medical problem rather than a behavioral or law enforcement one, Warren argued. Her plan is modeled on the government’s response in 1990 to the HIV/AIDS crisis, as she explained in a Medium post earlier this week.

“But we got a second problem in this country and it’s greed,” she said. “People didn’t get addicted all on their own, they got a lot of corporate help. They got a lot of help from corporations that made big money off getting people addicted and keeping them addicted.”

Kermit was a subject of a Pulitzer Prize winning series in 2016 that found drug wholesalers provided a single pharmacy in the 392-person town with 9 million hydrocodone pills over just two years. Warren's plan would dole out $100 billion over the next decade to states, cities, and nonprofits, with extra money going to cities and counties with the highest levels of overdoses.

“Right here in Mingo County, people are on the front lines of this opioid epidemic and this is a way to draw attention to the urgency of the moment,” she told reporters after the town hall.

Warren’s four-stop tour Friday and Saturday took her from the small towns of Kermit and Chillicothe, Ohio to Columbus, Ohio and Cincinnati. The latter's narcotics problem is so bad that the local paper assigned a reporter to the heroin beat.

Warren’s approach to the opioid crisis — which calls for treating victims and punishing perpetrators — largely mirrors her response to the financial crisis, when she called for jailing bankers and providing mass assistance for homeowners.

Her trip is the latest iteration of her campaign strategy to distinguish as the most substantive and well-prepared candidate in the sprawling Democratic field. Each time Warren rolls out a policy proposal — almost invariably with the theme of curbing corporate power and Washington corruption — her team schedules on-the-ground events to draw further attention.

When she announced her plan to break up big technology companies, Warren went to the South by Southwest tech conference and then to Long Island City, New York where Amazon had planned to build a headquarters. She whistle-stopped through Tennessee, Alabama, and the Mississippi delta after she unveiled a housing proposal aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.

A Republican protest — or “Trump support rally” — was organized a few hundred yards away from Warren's event in Kermit. But inside the fire station was remarkably devoid of partisanship, even if the topic was political.

Asked late Friday what stuck with her from the visit, Warren said it was the moment when she asked who had been personally affected by the opioid crisis and almost everyone’s hands went up.

“I was in the town where the pain of that decision by the government to not interfere was felt hard,” she said.

As Warren posed for selfies after the town hall, several people pressed notes into her hand that she read later in the car. ""Help our town of Kermit, West Virginia any way you can to help us be able to reduce the drug abuse,"" read one letter.

“A lot of people told me,‘You’re in the reddest of the red here,'” Warren said. But ""I like being here."""
Trump tells China to 'act now' on trade or face a 'far worse' deal in his second term,https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/11/trump-tells-china-to-act-now-on-trade-or-face-a-far-worse-deal-in-his-second-term.html,"President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping shake hands at a press conference following their meeting outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last November.

President Donald Trump on Saturday called for China to act now on trade or risk facing a worse deal if negotiations continue into a possible second term after the 2020 presidential election.

Trump claimed China was 'beaten so badly' in recent trade negotiations that Beijing wanted to wait until after the 2020 election in the hope a Democrat would win the White House and offer them a better deal.

Trump, however, said he would prevail in the upcoming election and warned that a trade deal would be 'much worse' for China if it was negotiated during his second term.





Chinese and U.S. negotiators held trade talks in Washington on Friday after Trump more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, raising the rate from 10% to 25%. The administration is also moving to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods.



Trump said Friday's talks were constructive and negotiations will continue while tariffs remain in place, though they could be lifted depending on how the situation progresses.



Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin told CNBC no further trade talks are planned between the two sides ""as of now."" Chinese state media has reported that the next round of talks is expected to take place in Beijing.



Trump abruptly announced the tariff hike last Sunday, shattering hopes that a trade deal was near and sending U.S. markets into turmoil for much of the week. The president cited slow progress in negotiations as the reason for his decision.

Chinese negotiators had reportedly backtracked on key aspects of the trade deal, removing commitments to change domestic laws to address U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers among a number of other issues.

Trump says it would be ‘appropriate’ to talk to Barr about possible Biden probe,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-it-would-be-appropriate-to-talk-to-barr-about-possible-biden-probe,"President Trump said Friday that it would be “appropriate” for him to talk to Attorney General William Barr about opening an investigation into former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

“Certainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to him about, but I have not done that as of yet. ... It could be a very big situation,” Trump told Politico.

GIULIANI CANCELS UKRAINE TRIP, SAYS HE'D BE 'WALKING INTO A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ENEMIES OF THE US'

Trump made his remarks after his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he would be traveling to Ukraine to urge the incoming Ukrainian government to look into several probes that may prove ""very, very helpful"" to the Trump White House as it looks to prove it was Democrats who improperly conspired with foreign governments, not the Trump campaign.

One of those investigations pertains to allegations that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in order to take the heat off the prosecutor's probe into a company that employed his son, Hunter, as a board member.

Another such investigation concerns evidence that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton campaign may have worked with Ukrainians to illegally help Clinton by revealing damaging information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

However, Giuliani said Friday evening on ""Fox News @ Night"" that he will not be traveling as planned, saying he believed he would be ""walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president, and in some cases, enemies of the United States and in one case, an already convicted person who has been found to be involved in assisting the Democrats with the 2016 investigation.”

Giuliani said his decisions had nothing to do with the 2020 election, but Giuliani had faced fierce pushback from Democrats, who accused the president of ""asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival.""

On Friday, Trump told Politico that the only reason the Biden controversy wasn’t a full-blown scandal yet is that Biden is a Democrat.

“Because he’s a Democrat,” Trump said, the revelations had about “one-hundredth” the impact as it would have if Biden “were a Republican.”

CLINTON-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG' AND 'INCREDIBLE,' WILL BE REVIEWED, TRUMP SAYS

It isn’t the first time Trump has weighed in on the controversies linking Democrats to Ukraine. Asked last month by Fox News host Sean Hannity whether Americans need to see the results of Ukraine's ongoing investigation into whether officials in that country worked with the Clinton team, Trump replied, ""I think we do.""

""It sounds like big stuff, very interesting with Ukraine,” he said.

But any push from Trump to get the Justice Department to investigate political opponents is likely to face intense resistance from Democrats.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., last week sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents -- after Barr appeared to demur on the question somewhat in congressional testimony.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

Trump hits retweet button 60 times in massive Twitter spree,https://nypost.com,['May'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/11/trump-hits-retweet-button-60-times-in-massive-twitter-spree/,"President Trump went on a retweeting spree Saturday morning, sharing other conservative voices more than 60 times.

The tweets covered many of the president’s passions, ranging from border security to criticism of Democrats. Trump retweeted media figures like Geraldo Rivera and pols including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).

The president also retweeted a few of his own previous tweets, including a Friday statement urging, “Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!”

The spree appeared to conclude just before 10 a.m., when Trump penned a fresh post. “Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. It’s very simple!”

The statement came after US and Chinese officials on Friday ended trade negotiations without making a deal and as a 25 percent import tax on $200 billion in Chinese goods went into effect."
Trump Said He Would Tame Rogue Nations. Now They Are Challenging Him.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['David E. Sanger', 'Edward Wong']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/trump-north-korea-iran-venezuela.html,"WASHINGTON — Three nations that have long defined themselves as bitter adversaries of the United States — North Korea, Iran and Venezuela — decided this week they could take on President Trump.

Each one is betting that Mr. Trump is neither as savvy a negotiator nor as ready to use military force as he claims. Each also poses a drastically different challenge to a president who has little experience in handling international crises, has struggled to find the right balance of diplomacy and coercion and has not always been consistent in defining his foreign policy.

The rising tensions with all three serve as reminders that Mr. Trump’s constant talk about taking care of problems that he has accused his predecessors of aggravating, or failing to confront, is difficult to convert into real-world solutions — as events of recent days have shown.

The confrontation with Iran appears to be the most volatile at the moment, with tensions escalating by the day. On Friday, the Pentagon said it was sending another naval ship and Patriot missile interceptor battery to the Middle East, in addition to an earlier dispatch of a carrier group and bombers, because of potential threats from Iran or allied Arab militias."
"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."
House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Kelsey Snell'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721876476/house-democrats-subpoena-trump-tax-returns,"House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
Secretary Pompeo to Meet With Putin as President Trump Seeks Better Russia Ties -- Again,http://time.com,"['Nick Wadhams', 'Ilya Arkhipov']",,,,http://time.com/5587644/pompeo-putin-trump-russia/,"U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo leaves for Moscow on Sunday, with President Donald Trump again calling for improved ties now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his investigation.

Pompeo will meet U.S. diplomats at the American Embassy in Moscow on Monday before continuing to Sochi for talks with President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials. The secretary has 48 hours — the entire length of the trip — to cram in discussions of disputes between the two nations, involving Ukraine, Venezuela and Syria and other issues, along with continued accusations of election interference.

With the Mueller inquiry wrapped up, Trump has returned to signaling his interest in improving U.S.-Russia ties, speaking with Putin for more than an hour last week and tweeting that there is “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.” The two leaders had kept their distance as Mueller’s probe into the 2016 U.S. election and allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia heated up.

“Clearly since the Mueller report came out, Trump is feeling unconstrained about what he’s wanted all along — a new relationship with Moscow where all the bad issues get swept aside and the two leaders ‘get down to business,”’ said Andrew Weiss, the former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council who’s now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“What that means in practice is really fuzzy because the agenda largely consists of issues where the U.S. and Russia are at loggerheads,” Weiss said.

Trump spoke with Putin briefly on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina in December. That meeting rekindled criticism of their summit last July in Helsinki, where the American president appeared to take Putin’s side over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies when asked about evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

Pompeo could use his trip to start laying the groundwork for a meeting between Trump and Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 forum in Japan set for late June. Such an encounter would still be fraught, especially since Trump has appeared reluctant to confront Putin on the meddling accusations, which the Mueller report reaffirmed.

“The Mueller report confirmed accusations of Russian meddling,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-founded think tank. “The report to some extent rehabilitates Trump but doesn’t rehabilitate Moscow at all. For Russia, nothing has really changed.”

A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Pompeo would raise a range of topics, including continuing concerns about Russian election meddling, Moscow’s role in propping up Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the American desire for more sweeping arms control agreements that include countries like China, not just Russia and the U.S.

The official argued that U.S. policy is to seek a better relationship with Moscow while also acknowledging that Russia has been responsible for several acts of aggression on the world stage.

One challenge, as it’s been throughout Trump’s presidency, is that while he may want better ties with Russia, relations between the two countries have seldom been worse and show little prospect of improving.

Besides contesting support for Maduro, there is the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in February. The administration is also angry at Russia over its detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors in the Sea of Azov last November and the poisoning of a former spy in the U.K. last year. In addition, American businessman Michael Calvey remains under house arrest in Moscow over allegations of fraud, a charge he rejects.

The president’s latest tweet on Russia also highlighted the dissonant tone the Trump administration has struck toward the country. While Pompeo blamed Russia for Maduro’s refusal to leave power despite pressure from the U.S., Trump said after his call with Putin that the Russian leader wasn’t looking to “get involved” in the crisis in Venezuela.

Trump’s calls will find a receptive audience. After the Mueller report came out, Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachyov urged the president to “take the risk” and seize the opportunity to reset relations.

“Putin has always bet personally on Trump, with whom he has a way of bonding to the point of manipulation,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and foreign policy analyst in Moscow. “Putin knows Trump likes him, while his administration does not. In Trump he trusts.”

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker admits he is 'nervous' about DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-admits-he-is-nervous-about-doj-inspector-general,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker admitted on Friday that he is “nervous” about DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into the conduct of the DOJ and the FBI during the Trump-Russia probe.

Sitting down with with Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes in a crowded room at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Baker said he is “assuming that they will dig and find stuff” and that “we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.” But Baker defended the FBI's actions, including its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Horowitz’s investigation is particularly focused on alleged FISA abuse and the reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele in FISA applications targeting Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS. The investigation is expected to finish in May or June.

Wittes said that Baker “had expressed great confidence in the way you guys conducted yourselves, in the integrity of these fundamental judgments, in the opening with respect to two separate investigations and with the respect to the handling of this FISA application.” Wittes then asked Baker: “So, how nervous are you about the IG?”

Baker said he is “always nervous about the IG,"" adding that “they’re coming in after the fact to look at what we did."" At the time, he said, the FBI was “trying to do it in real time and having the pressure to deal with these threats as they were coming.”

Baker contended that he was “confident in the judgments that I made at the time based on the information that I had available to me.” But he left open the possibility that others may have engaged in wrongdoing, saying, “I’m sure they will find things that I didn’t know at the time and maybe that others didn’t know at the time.”

“There were facts that existed in the Bureau that were known by certain people that weren’t known by others including me, that’s certainly possible and that happens frequently,” Baker said. “And so, I’m assuming that they will dig and find stuff like that. So, we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

During the event Friday, Baker defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier and stressed that he examined the FISA warrant applications on Page before they got signed and sent to the court. He said he was “comfortable” with their contents and was confident that the process remained “lawful.” Regarding the FISA court, Baker said: “These are federal judges for goodness' sake. They know how to evaluate wiretap applications. ... These are serious, serious judges.”

On the bureau’s handling of Steele, Baker said, “We’re not stupid. The FBI. We’re not stupid.”

And Baker said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker. ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line,"" he said.

“We are the Federal Bureau of Investigations, not the Federal Bureau of Conclusions,” Baker said defensively.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. And the New York Times reported that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Baker mentioned that he’s faced investigations before. “I’ve been investigated — or matters that I’ve worked on have been investigated — many times by the Inspector General. It’s not a pleasant process. It’s just not. The people are pleasant but the process is not the most enjoyable,"" he said.

Baker may have been referring to an alleged criminal leaks investigation that had been opened on him, which had been reported on as early as December 2017. He confirmed the existence of an investigation but declined to provide many specifics, saying, “Yes there is an investigation with respect to matters in which I was involved that is still open that I have cooperated fully with. I met with the investigative team for many hours over many days. That took place about a year and a half ago.”

“I haven’t heard anything since then … other than to hear from the Department that the matter is still open.” Baker said. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal.”

Baker was appointed as the FBI general counsel in January 2014 and was later reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, Baker resigned from the FBI and has since written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

As the event ended, Baker summed up his thoughts on all of these investigations. “Hindsight is 20/20,” he remarked."

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
Subpoenas issued for six years of Donald Trump tax returns,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48237313,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said he did not ""take this step lightly""

The chairman of a US Congressional committee has issued subpoenas for President Donald Trump's tax returns.

Richard Neal said in a statement he did not ""take this step lightly"", but believed it gave the committee ""the best opportunity"" to get the documents.

The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have until 17:00 (21:00 GMT) on 17 May to hand over six years of records.

The White House has so far refused requests to hand over the information.

Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has refused to disclose his tax details.

He has repeatedly said he is under audit by the IRS and so cannot release them - although the IRS says an audit would not stop the release of the information.

Democrats are investigating Mr Trump's business interests and possible conflicts of interests while he is president, as well as his past financial dealings.

A New York Times article on Wednesday said Mr Trump's businesses lost over $1bn between 1985 and 1994.

The president said he made the losses ""for tax purposes"", and attacked the newspaper for what he called ""a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job"".

Mr Trump's lawyer William Consovoy previously called the request for tax returns ""harassment"" and said the Treasury should not comply.

And Republican congressman Kevin Brady - member of the same Ways and Means Committee headed by Mr Neal - sent his chairman a letter on Friday asking him not to issue subpoenas.

Mr Brady argued it would be an ""attempt to weaponise the tax code and use Congress's legitimate oversight authority for political gain""."
Russia accuses U.S. military of deploying 'threat to our country' ahead of Pompeo talks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/russia-accuses-u-s-military-of-deploying-threat-to-our-country-ahead-of-pompeo-talks,"U.S. military assets are threatening Russia, Moscow’s top diplomat alleged just days before a high-profile visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pointed to President Trump's sale of missile-defense systems to Japan as evidence.

“We view these steps as a threat to our country,” he said, per state-run media.

Japanese officials have moved to fortify their missile defenses in response to North Korea’s development of ballistic missiles, but Russia has maintained that the U.S. and regional allies are using the threat as an excuse for a military buildup on their eastern border.

Lavrov renewed the complaint on Friday, just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is trying to set the table for “positive conversations” when he meets with President Vladimir Putin next week.

“We have once more focused our attention on some steps of Washington’s,” Lavrov said Friday after a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono. ""Among them are the deployment of global missile defense units in Japan, its increasing military presence in the region, and other actions in the disarmament and arms control fields, where the United States is smashing all the current agreements.”

Pompeo is taking a more conciliatory tone in lead-up to his meetings with Putin and Lavrov in Sochi next week, when he makes his first trip to Russia as the top U.S. diplomat. His team went so far as to withdraw a statement applauding the conviction of two Russian military intelligence officers who were charged with attempted terrorism in the wake of a failed coup attempt against Montenegro — a case that highlighted “Russia’s brazen attempt to undermine the sovereignty of an independent European nation,” as the State Department put it Thursday.

That statement was released by mistake and subsequently withdrawn from the department’s website. ""Pompeo opposed it,” Foreign Policy reported, citing sources “who suggested it was because the secretary wanted to soften combative tones with Moscow ahead of his forthcoming visit to Russia.”

The United States and Russia are at loggerheads on a number of issues, including some initiatives that Pompeo has orchestrated. The former Kansas Republican lawmaker oversaw the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Russia supports. He was the face of the decision to scrap a landmark Cold War-era nuclear arms control deal in response to Russian violations of the pact.

“No administration has been tougher than the Trump administration in imposing costs on Russia for its malign activities,” a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters in a preview of Pompeo’s agenda for his Tuesday meetings. “This is the work of diplomacy: showing up, having frank discussions, and working to find areas where we can cooperate.”

And Pompeo has been Trump’s top lieutenant in the negotiations to denuclearize North Korea, dating back to Easter of 2018, when he traveled to Pyongyang to begin negotiations with the regime even though he was still CIA director at the time.

The senior State Department official pointed to that effort as a subject where the administration has had relatively “constructive discussions” with Russia amid a host of thornier controversies. But Putin has worked to protect the regime from international sanctions throughout the crisis — by blocking the most aggressive proposals at the United Nations Security Council and overlooking North Korean smuggling operations that defy the sanctions, according to U.S. officials.

“Even though we don’t agree with Russia about all the details of how to achieve this goal, we will continue dialogue to bridge gaps on the way forward,” the senior State Department official told reporters.

Lavrov’s criticism of regional missile defenses shows how difficult that can be. Russian officials pushed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reject such armaments in December of 2016, just a few months after the regime test-fired a missile that landed within waters reserved for Japan’s exclusive economic use. The Russian Foreign Ministry maintained that such defense systems are “not commensurate with the threats emanating” from North Korea and argued that the United States was using the regime “as a pretext for deploying more advanced weapons in this region.”

North Korea subsequently tested a ballistic missile that flew over Japanese territory. But when the United States approved a $2 billion sale of Aegis Ashore missile defenses in January, Lavrov accused the two allies of conspiring to position cruise missiles on Russia’s eastern flank — an accusation that Japanese officials dismissed.

“Look, our mission set is to try and find paths forward,” Pompeo said to explain his outreach to Russia earlier this week. “I met with Foreign Minister Lavrov before. I met with my counterparts when I was at CIA to find places where we have overlapping interests where we can make progress together. That’s what I hope we can achieve. It may be that we can’t do that. We’ll see.”"

""Saint James Comey,"" Gowdy, R-S.C., said on ""Hannity,"" gave ""pretty much the same as any other interview. He is always right. He gets to write the moral script.""

During the town hall, Comey said that people like outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are not of ""strong character.""

“I think people like that, like Rod Rosenstein, who are people of accomplishment but not real sterling character, strong character, find themselves trapped. And then they start telling themselves a story to justify their being trapped which is, 'Yeah, he's awful but the country needs me,’” Comey told host Anderson Cooper.

During the event, Comey also told Cooper that he tried to avoid becoming like Rosenstein and other ""co-opted"" members of the administration by openly disagreeing with President Trump in the Oval Office.

Gowdy told host Jason Chaffetz that Comey seemingly believes he is correct, and ""everybody else is wrong.""

""When I asked Jim Comey how did the Russia investigation get started, who started it, he didn't know it was Peter Strzok, he never read the initiation document,"" Gowdy said. ""Comey refuses to believe that any of these decisions should be looked at, so he is always right.""

Biden camp responds after Giuliani's canceled trip to Ukraine,https://www.cnn.com,['Arlette Saenz'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/11/politics/biden-response-giuliani-ukraine/index.html,"(CNN) Joe Biden's campaign has offered its first response after President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he would make a now-canceled trip to Ukraine to urge the country to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate.

""It's great to see all these strong progressive voices stand up to this attempt at a blatantly political smear which in and of itself reflects the urgent need for change and to restore the soul of the country,"" a Biden campaign official told CNN.

Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke were among the 2020 Democratic contenders to express concern about Giuliani's efforts.

""I just think it is highly unethical for the President's personal lawyer to go meet with officials from foreign government to see if they can influence somehow the upcoming presidential election,"" Warren said in Kermit, West Virginia. ""We've had enough of that and Rudy Giuliani should just back off.""

In New Hampshire, O'Rourke said Giuliani's proposed trip to Ukraine was ""so very troubling, very disappointing, and and yet not a total surprise, given this President's behavior and the pattern that he'd already set.""

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

Russian agent saw political analysis as 'valuable' to Russia,https://www.weau.com,['Michael Balsamo Associated Press'],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/Russian-agent-saw-political-analysis-as-valuable-to-Russia-509753601.html,"A Russian gun rights activist who admitted she was a secret agent for the Kremlin and tried to infiltrate conservative U.S. political groups while Donald Trump rose to power says she believed her notes and analysis would be ""valuable"" for Russian officials.

Maria Butina, who admitted covertly gathering intelligence on the National Rifle Association and other groups at the direction of a former Russian lawmaker, spoke to National Public Radio in an interview airing Friday.

Butina pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent and was sentenced in April to serve 18 months behind bars. The 30-year-old has been jailed since her arrest in July.

Butina admitted that she had worked with former Russian lawmaker Alexander Torshin to use their contacts in the NRA to pursue back channels to American conservatives during the 2016 presidential campaign. She violated U.S. law because she did not report her activities to the U.S. government.

As part of her plea agreement, Butina acknowledged she ""sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics.""

In the interview with NPR, Butina admitted that she knew Torshin was providing the information she gleaned to Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said that she was honored to help.

""I said that I would be honored because, well, I am a young woman and there you have people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would consider my notes, my analysis, as valuable,"" Butina said. ""It was very pleasant for me. So of course I said, 'Of course, yes.'""

Butina admitted she should have registered with the U.S. government but argued her actions took place out in the open and she wasn't a spy. Her lawyers argued she was simply a student interested in American politics and better U.S.-Russian relations.

""I love both countries, and I was building peace,"" Butina said in the interview.

Now, Butina is ""embarrassed that instead of creating peace by not registering I created discord,"" something she says she'll carry with her for the rest of her life.

Butina will be deported back to Russia after she finishes serving her prison sentence. She said she has no concerns about returning to Russia because people who know her ""know as a matter of fact that I am not a spy nor do I have any secret information.""

""I don't think I have any problems or I could have any concerns about my safety,"" she added. ""I don't see that happening.""

The charges against Butina were brought by federal prosecutors in Washington, and her case was separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Butina said she knew nothing about Russia's efforts to interfere in U.S. elections.

"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."

Federal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a “substantially related” case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department’s second-highest-ranking official.

James Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies. The major Chinese telecom equipment-maker was indicted in January on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of Iran sanctions, and conspiracy to launder money and to obstruct justice.

[Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions]

The high-profile case has drawn much publicity as it is taking place against the backdrop of President Trump’s efforts to seal a trade deal with China and an attempt by his administration to keep Huawei out of the global 5G wireless networks on national security grounds.

In a redacted motion filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors argued that while Cole is defending Huawei, his work in the related investigation, which they did not disclose, “creates the real risk that he will breach his duty of confidentiality to the [Department of Justice] by relying on information he obtained while representing the department.”

Moreover, they said, “there is a risk that Cole will breach his duty of loyalty to the department by making arguments on behalf of the defendants that contradict positions he previously took while representing the DOJ.”

Neither Cole nor his attorney responded to a request for comment.

The move to disqualify is fairly unusual, but analysts note that if the government thinks there is a conflict of interest, prosecutors have an obligation to bring this concern to the court’s attention.

Cole, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm, informed the Justice Department in January that he was representing Huawei. Later that month, the department informed Cole that he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.

In a follow-up meeting, Cole and representatives of the Justice Department and the FBI discussed the issue, and after giving Cole a one-day clearance, the government provided him with “privileged and classified” information “in order to have a fulsome discussion,” prosecutors said.

In March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel “were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.”

Later that month, he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference, on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole’s motion for the time being. Last week, prosecutors asked the court to remove him.

“It’s a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole’s pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,” said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. “But the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.”

While the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department’s most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.

“It’s difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. “The court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination.”"
Shanahan’s nomination comes as the Pentagon chief ‘spins a lot of plates’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/shanahans-nomination-comes-as-the-pentagon-chief-spins-a-lot-of-plates,"SHANAHAN GETS THE JOB: Patrick Shanahan learned yesterday afternoon during a visit to the White House that after serving more than four months as acting defense secretary, he’ll be nominated by President Trump to keep the job.

The official announcement came in a tweet from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who said that over the last several months Shanahan has proven “he is beyond qualified” to lead the Department of Defense.

The long-expected nomination comes two weeks after an investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general cleared Shanahan of allegations that he attempted to exert undue influence on behalf of his former employer Boeing.

CALLED MOM: A “very excited” Shanahan spoke briefly with reporters outside the Pentagon as he awaited the arrival of Japan’s chief cabinet secretary and said one of the first things he did was make a phone call. “I called my mom. She was super happy.” Asked about his priorities once confirmed, Shanahan said simply, “Do the job.”

Shanahan has been juggling multiple crises — Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, and Afghanistan — all while facing a showdown with Congress over the president's budget, which will require an elusive bipartisan agreement to be fully funded. “As you can tell, there are real-world events that happen every day, and so you have to spin a lot of plates,” he said.

In his formal statement, Shanahan said he was honored by Trump’s intention to nominate him. “If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy. I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”

PLENTY OF SUPPORT: While Shanahan has his critics on Capitol Hill, who think his résumé is light on foreign policy experience, most lawmakers seem to understand that as he seeks to carry out Trump’s directives, he’s not always defending policies he created or supported.

Earlier this month Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., questioned Shanahan about a dubious White House plan to get around spending limits by shifting almost $100 billion to the overseas contingency operations account, or OCO.

“This OCO thing is a gimmick. We all know it's a gimmick,” Cole lectured Shanahan, but then gave him a pass. “Look, I know who you work for. And I know that OMB, you know, sets these things up.”

Republicans have already signaled they will support his confirmation. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement that “after working with him closely over the last few months, I welcome his selection.”

“I applaud the nomination,” said Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “Pat Shanahan has proven his willingness and ability to take on important reforms at DOD.”

And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. — who by his own account locked horns with Shanahan in a tense exchange at the Munich Security Conference in February — also signaled he’ll vote to confirm him.

Graham, who is no longer on the Armed Services Committee but remains an influential voice on national security issues, called Shanahan “a logical choice” to be Trump’s second defense secretary. “He has demonstrated to me his detailed understanding that a strong, modern, and well-trained military is essential in a dangerous and complex world.”

Graham seems to be over his irritation with Shanahan for not being a more forceful advocate for keeping U.S. troops in Syria after Trump ordered a full withdrawal in December. Graham told Shanahan at the conference, “That’s the dumbest f—ing idea I’ve ever heard.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Every new administration makes the same vow, promising to overhaul the Pentagon’s arcane and notoriously inefficient acquisition rules that consistently result in weapons programs that are over budget and overdue.

This morning, Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s under secretary for acquisition and sustainment, will brief reporters on the latest reforms designed to spend the taxpayer’s money on smarter purchases. The rare on-camera press briefing will be live streamed at 10 a.m. at www.defense.gov/Watch/Live-Events .

TRUMP BLAMES KERRY: President Trump suggested yesterday that were it not for illegal interference by former secretary of state John Kerry, he might well have been able to conduct productive talks with Iran over its nuclear program by now.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump said at a White House event. “You know, John Kerry speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act. And, frankly, he should be prosecuted on that.”

The Logan Act bars private citizens from conducting unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments. No has been convicted of violating the 1799 law, although some suggested fired national security adviser Michael Flynn may have run afoul of it in his discussions with the Russians in the weeks before Trump took office.

The Boston Globe reported last May that Kerry had secretly been in talks with the Iranian government to salvage the nuclear deal after the Trump administration withdrew from it.

KERRY’S REBUTTAL: Trump's claim ""is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesman for Kerry told CNN in a statement. ""He's wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he's been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe,” said Matt Summers. “We'd hope the President would focus on solving foreign policy problems for America instead of attacking his predecessors for theater.”

‘NOBODY’S HAPPY’: President Trump said yesterday the United States is still assessing what message North Korea is trying to send by firing off short-range missiles for the second time in a week. But it seems clear Kim Jong Un is frustrated by the hardline stance of Trump’s negotiators, who are refusing any sanctions relief until Pyongyang shows it is serious about denuclearization.

“We're looking at it very seriously right now. They were smaller missiles, short-range missiles,” Trump said. “Nobody's happy about it, but we're taking a good look and we'll see. We'll see. The relationship continues, but we'll see what happens.”

“I know they want to negotiate. They're talking about negotiating. But I don't think they're ready to negotiate,” he added.

MAKING THINGS WORSE: “While this recent launch of short-range missiles does not violate Pyongyang’s promise to halt longer-range tests, North Korea has now made it clear it will not halt developing other parts of its military capabilities that threaten the region,” says Harry Kazianis, Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest.

Kim’s goal is quite clear, Kazianis argues, namely “to show America and its allies that if they aren’t willing to compromise on the terms of denuclearization that Pyongyang will indeed go its own way, with missile launches once again becoming the new norm and even longer-range tests like ICBM and nuclear weapons tests potentially coming by the summer.”

U.S. SEIZES N. KOREAN SHIP: The Justice Department announced yesterday that for the first time ever the United States has seized a North Korean cargo ship, alleging it violated international sanctions. “This sanctions-busting ship is now out of service,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement , which outlined what the Justice Department called “a scheme to export tons of high-grade coal to foreign buyers by concealing the origin of their ship, the ‘Wise Honest.’”

Maintenance for the ship, one of North Korea’s largest carriers, was paid for in U.S. dollars through unwitting U.S. banks. So far, there has been no reaction from Pyongyang.

CHARGED WITH LEAKING: A former intelligence analyst and Afghanistan veteran has been charged with leaking classified information to the media. Daniel Everett Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., was arrested on federal charges yesterday.

The recipient of the leak is not named in the indictment, but the charging document identifies him as Jeremy Scahill of the Intercept, an outspoken critic of America’s military activities overseas.

GUILTY OF SPYING: A former CIA case officer has pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to commit espionage on behalf of China. “I conspired to gather and send secret-level information to PRC, the government of PRC,” said Jerry Chun Shing Lee in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Lee, 54, served in the CIA for 13 years but left in 2007 and went to live in Hong Kong. In 2010, he was approached by two Chinese intelligence officers who offered to pay him a gift of $100,000 cash in exchange for national defense information Lee had acquired while at the CIA.

IT SLICES, IT DICES: The United States military and the CIA have been using a previously unknown missile variant designed to minimize unintended civilian casualties when targeting terrorists, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

The modified Hellfire missile, called the R9X, has been outfitted with two different payloads that do not explode. Instead, the missiles can carry 100 pounds of metal designed to cut through the tops of cars and buildings and ""a halo of six long blades"" that shred through anything in its path.

“The R9X is known colloquially to the small community of individuals who are familiar with its use as ‘the flying Ginsu,’ for the blades that can cut through buildings, car roofs or other targets. The nickname is a reference to the popular knives sold on TV infomercials in the late 1970s and early 1980s that showed them cutting through both tree branches and tomatoes,” the Journal report says.

The payloads were said to have been created in response to targets placing themselves among civilians so normal explosive ordnance could not be used without risking civilian casualties.

The Journal says it has confirmed the weapons killed Ahmad Hasan Abu Khayr al-Masr, al Qaeda’s second in command, in 2017 and, most recently, Jamal al-Badawi, who was accused of being behind the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole.

GOLD STAR RELIEF: A group of 29 senators has “introduced legislation to provide tax relief to the surviving spouses and children of military members killed in action,” according to a statement from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. The Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act is an attempt to correct an unintended consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which “inadvertently treats military and VA survivor benefits as trusts or estates, subjecting these benefits to a much higher tax rate.”

“The Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act effectively fixes this error by treating any military and VA survivor benefits as earned income, rather than at the trust or parent tax rate,” Warner’s statement says. Elaine Luria, D-Va., introduced companion legislation in the House last week.

LBJ’S PHONY VALOR: Last month’s christening of the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, the newest Zumwalt-class destroyer, brought to mind a now-mostly-forgotten story of how Johnson, who had a brief undistinguished naval career while serving in Congress, posed as a war hero by wearing a Silver Star lapel pin that he knew he didn’t rate.

In 2001, while working for CNN, I spent months exhaustively researching the story behind what famed Johnson biographer Robert Caro called “one of the most undeserved Silver Stars in history.”

In today’s social media age, anyone who wore a decoration for the third-highest military award for valor when in fact all he did was fly on a plane as a passenger, never encountering the enemy, would face ridicule and shame. But Johnson got away with it for decades and even bragged about his fictional bravery under fire.

If you don’t know the history of the lie behind Johnson’s phony valor , you can read about it in this week’s issue of the Washington Examiner magazine.

Barr jokes about Democrats' contempt vote,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-jokes-about-democrats-contempt-vote,"Attorney General William Barr joked about a contempt of Congress vote on Thursday.

During a farewell ceremony for his Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Barr poked fun at House Democrats.

“You like records,” Barr said at the Justice Department event, referring to Rosenstein. “This must be a record for an attorney general being proposed for contempt within a hundred days of taking office.”

After the Justice Department defied a subpoena to hand over special counsel Robert Mueller's full, unredacted report for the Russia investigation, the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite Barr for contempt of Congress on Wednesday, but did so along party lines. Meanwhile, the White House asserted executive privilege over Mueller's findings.

Republicans voted against the contempt resolution, arguing Democrats are seeking to drag out the Mueller probe, which found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians, but made no determination about whether Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.

2 Chinese Men Indicted for Anthem Insurer Hack,http://time.com,['Ken Kusmer And Frank Bajak'],,,,http://time.com/5587097/anthem-insurer-hack-china/,"(INDIANAPOLIS) — A federal grand jury has indicted two members of “extremely sophisticated” hacking group operating from China in the 2014-2015 theft of the personal information of nearly 79 million customers of insurer Anthem Inc., the biggest known health care hack in U.S. history.

The Justice Department said the two also hacked three other U.S.-based companies it did not name, one in the technology sector, the others in basic materials and communications.

The indictment unsealed Thursday alleges Fujie Wang, a 32-year-old who goes by the Western name “Dennis,” and a man with three listed aliases identified as John Doe stole data including names, birthdates, Social Security numbers and medical IDs, first accessing Anthem’s network in May 2014.

Their access was not terminated until January 2015 after they were detected, the indictment says.

Indianapolis-based Anthem, the nation’s second-largest health insurer, agreed last October to pay the government a record $16 million to settle potential privacy violations.

Anthem said in a statement that it was “pleased” with the indictment and stressed that “there is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud.”

Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of the cybersecurity firm Hold Security, said there is no credible evidence any of the stolen data was ever put up for sale for use in identity theft. He said the Anthem data would be much more potent “on a state-sponsored level” for purposes of espionage than it would be in private hands.

The indictment did not say whether U.S. authorities have evidence the hackers were working for the Chinese state. U.S. officials blame state-backed Chinese hackers for rampant theft of Western intellectual property and trade secrets but did not lodge similar allegations in Thursday’s indictment.

A Justice Department spokeswoman had no comment when asked how confident it is that Wang will be brought to the U.S. for prosecution. The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The indictment says Wang lives in Shenzhen, China, and that Doe’s activities were China-based.

In a 2015 report, the cybersecurity firm Symantec said the Anthem hack was believed to be the work of a well-resourced Chinese group it called Black Vine that it said had been actively conducting cyberespionage for three years targeting industries including aerospace, energy and health care.

The indictment alleges that Doe and others in the hacking group used spear-phishing emails and other exploits to compromise the systems of the targeted companies. The two are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in relation to computers and identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

When Anthem agreed to pay $16 million in a settlement with the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS said its investigation found that Anthem had failed to deploy adequate measures for countering hackers.

Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
London mayor says Trump is ‘not in same class’ as Obama and Bush,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2019/05/10/london-mayor-calls-trump-not-same-class-obama-and-bush/kC7zVUZD4vmyKesI5YYIMI/story.html,"‘‘History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,’’ Khan said. ‘‘President Trump is not in the same class as those two.’’

‘‘Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,’’ Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the American leader is not ‘‘in the same class’’ as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

The only two state visits to Britain by US presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, with President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less-formal visits by world leaders.

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. ‘‘I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,’’ she told a White House news conference.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by thousands of protesters and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the US president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the American leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that as he is a Muslim he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan ‘‘rude’’ and ‘‘ignorant’’ on ‘‘Good Morning Britain.’’

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from Prime Minister May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. ‘‘It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,’’ Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump ‘‘rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.’’

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

‘‘The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,’’ Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. ‘‘There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.’’

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issue when Trump visits, though not necessarily in ‘‘Hugh Grant-type, public scene,’’ referencing a fictional faceoff between a US president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie ‘‘Love Actually.’’

‘‘We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship.

"Facing Democratic resistance, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promotes oil and gas drilling",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'The Washington Post']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/10/facing-democratic/,"Washington • The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Donald Trump’s plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

""So that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,"" he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. ""What I hope is, as an organization we learn from any error we make.""

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department's decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation's carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

""The law requires us to analyze those things,"" he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. ""It doesn't say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.""

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president's order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said that he expected to get a briefing on this week's U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world's plants and animals are at risk of extinction, but added that Interior and the Commerce Department still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

""We didn't start doing them to not do them,"" he said.

As he pursues the administration's agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on Interior.

""We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,"" McCollum said. ""Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what's the bare minimum.""

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately on Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

""You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,"" he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary's office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska's Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"
US Treasury Ironically Accusing Vietnam of Currency Manipulation,https://beincrypto.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-ironically-accusing-vietnam-currency-manipulation/,"Recent months have seen increasing tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) via increases in interest rates. These have come in response to a robust US economy, a high-flying stock market, and a strong US dollar.

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong — the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country’s actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam’s active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam’s tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‘trustless’ environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."

"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump’s $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation’s two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan’s third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan’s second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, “Given the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.”

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

“The problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president’s budget will do that,” said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president’s request."
"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

Justice Department Charges Daniel Everette Hale With Leaking Secrets to Media,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Olivia Messer'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-charges-daniel-everette-hale-with-leaking-secrets-to-media,"A former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency has been charged with leaking classified information to the press about the Obama administration’s use of armed drones, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. It’s the latest in a series of prosecutions by the Trump administration aimed at sources of the press.

Daniel Everette Hale, 31, was charged under the Espionage Act of illegally disclosing top-secret and secret documents to a news organization, according to an indictment filed in March and unsealed Thursday. He was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday morning.

Details from the indictment suggest the organization is The Intercept, which did not respond to a request for comment. It is the third time the Justice Department has prosecuted an alleged Intercept source in the past two years.

Hale served in the Air Force from July 2009 to July 2013, during which time he was assigned to the National Security Agency, according to the indictment. He was deployed to Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence analyst. While still at the NSA, in April 2013, Hale allegedly began communicating with an unnamed reporter.

The two met on multiple occasions and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to the indictment. Hale allegedly texted a friend in May 2013, claiming that “[the reporter] wants me to tell my story about working with drones at the opening screening of his documentary about the war and the use of drones.”

Hale left the Air Force in July 2013 and was hired by a defense contractor, where he was assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. From February to August 2014, Hale allegedly printed a total of 36 documents and provided at least 17 to the reporter, some of which were unclassified, according to the indictment. Eleven were secret or top secret documents.

The documents contained a PowerPoint presentation on counterterrorism operations, described a military campaign targeting Al-Qaeda, included information gathered by the NSA on specific named targets, and outlined U.S. military technical capabilities. The documents were later compiled and published by the news website and in a book authored by the reporter, according to the indictment.

Hale was charged with theft of government property and several other counts under the Espionage Act.

Hale’s arrest comes amid a crackdown on leakers to journalists by the Trump administration. Last month, the U.S. charged WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange with allegedly helping veteran intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack a computer password to steal classified documents. In October, a Treasury Department employee was charged with sharing financial information on targets of the Mueller investigation with BuzzFeed.

Last year, two purported Intercept sources were also prosecuted. Former NSA contractor Reality Winner was sentenced to 63 months in prison for leaking classified information about Russian election interference to The Intercept. In October, former FBI agent Terry Albury was sentenced to four years in prison after he pleaded guilty to making an unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, apparently related to how the FBI recruits informants."
"State Department should be investigated too, for actions overseas",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'L. Todd Wood']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/9/state-department-should-be-investigated-too-for-ac/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

With the investigations of the investigators beginning under the watch of Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department, we would like to highlight that it has not just been the FBI, and America’s other intelligence agencies, who were corrupted during the Obama administration.

The State Department is also knee deep in the Deep State with Obama holdovers working their seditious black magic in the cubicles of Foggy Bottom and around the world.

We have written extensively on these pages about the corrupt actions of Ambassador *Donald Lu in Albania, where he used the powers of his office to interfere in the political discourse of a foreign country, supporting the socialist government of Prime Minister Edi Rama, a man who is so close to Leftist philanthropist and activist George Soros that he was invited to his wedding. Mr. Lu even went so far as to cancel American visas of Albanian opposition figures in his bid to curry favor with the far left and ensure socialist rule. He has since left Albania for Kyrgyzstan, where he is up to his old tricks, once again interfering in local affairs and pushing the globalist agenda, right under the nose of the leadership in Washington.

Mr. Lu’s supposed replacement for Albania, former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Kathleen Ann Kavalec, had her nomination withdrawn from consideration in Congress after information surfaced that she was connected to the Fusian GPS attempted coup by the Deep State.

The current U.S. Charge d’affaires Leyla Moses-Ones was caught blatantly and arrogantly tweeting against her boss, President Trump last year. More precisely, she retweeted a disloyal Twitter ramble about Mr. Trump by possibly soon to be indicted former head of the FBI, James Comey. Once exposed, Moses-Ones’ tweet was swiftly deleted.

We have also written about how the American embassy in Tirana has been actively involved in ‘judicial reform’ in Albania, which has led to complete lawlessness in the country of oligarch rule, because no constitutional court has been empaneled. That was the goal all along of course. The law was written by Soros consultants.

Former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, meanwhile, was caught ‘unmasking’ scores of Americans during her tenure with the Obama administration. This situation has not really been delved into by authorities, as the Trump-Russia hoax has sucked most of the oxygen from the room for the past two and a half years. Ms. Power’s actions should be investigated, however. Why in the world would the ambassador to the United Nations need to unmask American citizens via FISA surveillance? Hopefully we will know the answer to that question one day.

Just this week, the American representative to Ukraine, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was forced out two months early from her post. The allegation is that she played a role in State Department collusion with the Ukrainian government to ensure the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by releasing damaging information on Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

Reports are that Ukraine’s prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Ms. Yovanovitch actually gave him a “list of people whom we should not prosecute” during their first meeting. Of course, these were allegedly all Obama administration officials.

The Soros’ cancer runs deep and wide throughout the State Department, where American tax dollars are a convenient piggy bank for his army of NGOs around the world which routinely are granted large amounts of money to work the open borders and open society globalist agenda.

This has to stop.

Americans are tired of big government working behind their backs for other nations and other agendas rather than Trump’s America First. To fully drain the swamp, Foggy Bottom needs to receive a visit from the Trump plumber.

The subpoena comes after Schiff (D-Calif.) and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, made a rare joint request for the documents. Schiff said the Justice Department had yet to respond to the committee’s request, prompting him to issue a subpoena.

“The department has repeatedly failed to respond, refused to schedule any testimony, and provided no documents responsive to our legitimate and duly authorized oversight activities,” Schiff said in a statement.

“The department repeatedly pays lip service to the importance of a meaningful accommodation process, but it has only responded to our efforts with silence or outright defiance,” Schiff added. “Today, we have no choice but to issue a subpoena to compel their compliance.”

The committee’s subpoena requires the Justice Department to turn over the documents by May 15.

Schiff and Nunes penned joint letters to Barr — one on March 27 and another on April 25 — demanding the full Mueller report and its supporting materials. In the second letter, the lawmakers threatened a subpoena “absent meaningful compliance” by the end of last week.

In his letter to Barr informing the attorney general of the subpoena, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee required the information in order to “discharge its unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities,” including conducting oversight, examining potential national security issues and drawing up legislation to address vulnerabilities.

Schiff said the Justice Department claimed that it was accommodating his and Nunes’ request by allowing the lawmakers — in addition to 10 other senior members of Congress — to view a less-redacted version of the report.

“Neither of these responses amounted to a good faith effort to negotiate an accommodation of the committee’s request,” Schiff wrote, adding that his staff reminded the Justice Department of its “expansive and voluminous” production of documents related to the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

“These materials were of the precise type the department now claims it is prohibited from giving to the full committee, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information, documents related to third parties, and those pertaining to ongoing investigations,” Schiff wrote.

The committee’s announcement comes the same day the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel’s subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence.

Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the full report and its underlying materials — at Barr’s urging — in order to prevent the Justice Department from complying with the committee’s subpoena.

Schiff’s and Nunes’ numerous requests for the full Mueller report come despite efforts by Republicans on the Judiciary panel to back the Justice Department’s position that Congress does not have a right to the materials — in particular, the grand-jury information.

"Trump's new plan to aid American farmers faces many hurdles, says ex-USDA chief",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Daniels'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/trumps-new-plan-to-aid-farmers-faces-many-hurdles-says-ex-usda-chief.html,"President Donald Trump Carlos Barria | Reuters

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Friday said President Donald Trump has directed his agency to work on a plan to help farmers impacted by the ongoing trade war with China. Perdue didn't offer further details on a possible plan but Trump via Twitter on Friday indicated that the U.S. could use some of the money from tariffs on Chinese goods to buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products from American farmers, or ""far more than China buys now."" The president also said U.S. agricultural products could be shopped ""to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.""

The Department of Agriculture declined to comment on plans it might have under consideration. However, a former USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, told CNBC that the administration has ""very limited options"" although it could some funds by tapping into the Commodity Credit Corp., a federal agency given authority during the Great Depression. ""The secretary's options are limited given the size of the challenge,"" said Vilsack, currently president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, a trade group. Vilsack also suggested the program may require congressional approval, although a trade mitigation plan the USDA unveiled last year for American farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs didn't require it. Vilsack added, ""They could do something. Whether they could do it to the extent that he's [Trump] suggested I think would require some congressional authorization and direction. I don't think there's enough flexibility in the USDA budget to be able to carve up and be able to identify $15 billion.""

Last July, Perdue unveiled a $12 billion trade aid program for American farmers that included trade promotion, food purchases, and direct payments to producers of soybeans, pork, corn, cotton, dairy and several other commodities. That earlier program utilized the CCC for so-called market facilitation payments to farmers, with the top five commodities being soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum. ""I think what the president was talking about was buying a bunch of soybeans,"" said Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served in the USDA during the Obama administration. ""And even if the secretary can identify the resources to purchase crops and products, getting them to countries requires a second step by USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] and the State Department."" Soybeans have been hard hit by Chinese tariffs, falling near 10-year lows on Monday amid the threat of an escalated trade war with China. Before the trade war, China was buying more than $12 billion worth of U.S. soybeans annually, or roughly 1 in 3 rows of soybeans grown on the nation's farms. Last year, China bought about $3.2 billion worth of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. But China last year imposed 25% tariffs on a variety of agricultural products including soybeans — a top commodity in many states where Trump received strong support during the 2016 presidential election. Trump's suggestion that the U.S. government buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are targeting the Midwest states for support. Meantime, Vilsack said it may be difficult for the administration to move quickly on the plan for other reasons. For one, he said some countries might not want to take the food commodities because it could have negative repercussions domestically. ""They would prefer to take cash because they don't want to disrupt their own agricultural economy by having foreign crops come in and displace domestically produced crops,"" he said.

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
Vietnam veteran files federal lawsuit to remove Bible on display at VA hospital,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vietnam-war-veteran-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-bible-at-veterans-hospital,"A Vietnam War veteran filed a federal lawsuit against the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center this week in an attempt to remove a Bible on display at the New Hampshire facility.

James Chamberlain, who served in the U.S. Air Force, is a Christian but believes the Bible in the VA facility’s lobby violates the First Amendment. According to the lawsuit, the Constitution bars the government from giving “favoritism to one religious belief at the expense of others.”

""Despite his personal beliefs, he is offended that other people's beliefs are not represented,"" Chamberlain's attorney Larry Vogelman said, according to NBC Boston . ""To isolate one religion and hold it out as the official religion is just wrong.""

The Bible, which was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II, is featured at the Missing Man Table that remembers missing veterans and prisoners of war. But the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday, claims that the original table tradition didn’t feature the Bible and that the table should honor all who served.

The Bible was initially removed in January after the Military Religious Freedom Foundation said that 14 veterans of multiple faiths opposed its placement. However, the Bible was put back in February.

Curt Cashour, a spokesperson for the VA, said in a statement that the VA would not be “bullied” moving forward.

""This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,"" Cashour said."
House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Ryan Mccrimmon']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/interior-department-salaries-threat-1414201,"Chairman Elijah Cummings also complained that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Energy & Environment House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
Justice Department charges Deep Dot Web administrators with money laundering – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/doj-deep-dot-web-indictment/,"U.S. prosecutors have formally brought charges against the alleged co-owners and administrators of Deep Dot Web, who were arrested Tuesday.

Tal Prihar, 37, and Michael Phan, 34 — both Israeli citizens — were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to a newly unsealed indictment.

Prihar, who resided in Brazil, was arrested by French police in Paris on Monday, while Phan was arrested by Israeli police in a simultaneous raid.

The two are accused of making millions of dollars in commission from Deep Dot Web, a website featuring news, reviews and information about dark web sites and marketplaces. Prosecutors said the administrators made their commission by linking to marketplaces on the dark web — only accessible through Tor, an encrypted anonymity network.

Many of the dark web marketplaces sold drugs, weapons and stolen data, which hackers could use to break into online accounts.

A staffer at Deep Dot Web said in a Medium post following the arrests that Deep Dot Web would generate a slice of the revenue from purchases made on dark web marketplaces, said to be as much as 4%. Brazil’s federal police said in a statement the site made millions in dollars in cryptocurrency from referral sales from more than 15,000 dark web users.

Following the arrests, the FBI seized Deep Dot Web’s website.

“It was truly a 50:50 partnership between the two defendants,” said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference in Pittsburgh on Wednesday announcing the charges.

According to the district attorney, more than 23% of all transactions made on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace taken down by authorities in 2017, were associated with a referral link from Deep Dot Web. The indictment also said Deep Dot Web referred more than 198,000 users to Hansa, another defunct market, accounting for nearly half of the site’s users, of which Deep Dot Web “received a commission on all of those users’ purchases.”

The indictment said Prihar and Phan made about 8,155 bitcoins in total — almost half of which was collected from AlphaBay. Prosecutors said at its peak, the bitcoins were worth more than $15.4 million.

“This is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,” said Brady."
