Ilhan Omar promised to continue being President Trump’s ""nightmare"" as she received a warm welcome in her Minnesota district on Thursday, following a turbulent week in which she repeatedly clashed with the White House.

Hundreds of people greeted Omar at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, many carrying placards of support for the freshman congresswoman.

AOC, ILHAN OMAR ACCUSE TRUMP OF 'SPEWING FASCIST IDEOLOGY' AFTER RALLY

Last week, controversy ensued after Trump said that Omar and three other far-left congresswomen – Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley – should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.”

Critics deemed Trump’s comments racist and divisive particularly as all four congresswomen are American citizens, with three of them born in the U.S. (Omar was born in Somalia.)

“The reality is everybody talks about how [Trump] is threatened because we criticize him,” Omar told the crowd at the airport, MPR News reported. “But the reality is he is threatened because we are inspiring people to dream about a country that recognizes our dignity and our humanity.”

TRUMP DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM 'SEND HER BACK' CHANT: 'I DISAGREE WITH IT'

“His nightmare is seeing the beautiful mosaic fabric of our country welcome someone like me as their member of Congress,” Omar added. “We are going to continue being a nightmare to this president because his policies are a nightmare to us.”

“His nightmare is seeing the beautiful mosaic fabric of our country welcome someone like me as their member of Congress. We are going to continue being a nightmare to this president because his policies are a nightmare to us.” — U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

Omar later attended a packed town hall where she pitched the progressive proposal of “Medicare for All” as her supporters gave her a standing ovation.

Before the appearance in her home district, Omar called Trump a “fascist” after a chant “send her back” erupted during a campaign rally on Wednesday, a chant Trump said he disagreed with.

“I believe he is fascist,” Omar told reporters on Capitol Hill, adding that “I want to remind people that this is what this president and his supporters have turned our country that is supposed to be a country that we allow democratic debate and dissent to take place.”"
"Dan Le Batard Goes In On President Trump, Rips ESPN's ""Cowardly"" No-Politics Pivot",https://deadspin.com,"['Chris Thompson', 'About The Author', 'Staff Writer']",,,,https://deadspin.com/dan-le-batard-goes-in-on-president-trump-rips-espns-c-1836512464,"Dan Le Batard used a portion of his Thursday show to denounce the scene at Donald Trump’s rally in North Carolina Wednesday, when the racist president stirred the racist crowd into a racist euphoria that featured chants of “send her back” directed at Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Le Batard called the chants “un-American” and correctly described the president’s deliberate “instigation of racial division,” citing a tweet from FS1's Nick Wright:

Le Batard’s commentary about President Trump and his supporters was very clearly and unapologetically afoul of ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro’s shameful stick-to-sports mandate. Le Batard confronted that, too, head-on and in unambiguous terms, decrying the company’s position as “cowardly” and a “weak-ass shield.” Here’s the video:

Here are the portions having to do with ESPN’s pivot away from discussing politics, which I have lovingly transcribed for you, because they rule:

“We here at ESPN haven’t had the stomach for that fight, because Jemele [Hill] did some things on Twitter and you saw what happened after that, and then here all of a sudden nobody talks politics on anything unless we can use one of these sports figures as a meat-shield in the most cowardly possible way to discuss these subjects.” [...] “The only way we can discuss it around here—because this isn’t about politics, it’s about race; what you’re seeing happening around here is about race and it’s been turned into politics—we only talk about it around here when Steve Kerr or [Gregg] Popovich says something. We don’t talk about what is happening unless there’s some sort of weak, cowardly sports angle that we can run it through, when sports has always been a place where this stuff changes.” [...] “We won’t talk about it unless Russell Wilson is saying something about it on his Instagram page. Then we have the power to run with it. Weak-ass shield. It is antithetical to what we should be, and if you’re not calling it abhorrent, obviously racist, dangerous rhetoric, you’re complicit.”

It’s a great and angry and righteous monologue. By ESPN’s definition it is surely “pure politics” before you even get to the part where Le Batard all but explicitly calls Pitaro a coward and accuses him of complicity in a campaign to foment racial hostility toward black and brown people. It seems inevitable that Le Batard will now be suspended for saying true things on the air."
Trump: US warship destroyed Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-us-warship-iranian-drone-strait-hormuz,"A U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions between the two countries, President Trump announced Thursday.

“The U.S. reserves the right to defend personnel, facilities, interests,” he said.

Trump said the USS Boxer took defensive action after the drone closed to within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. The president called it the latest “hostile” action by Iran.

Marines on board took down the drone using electronic jamming equipment, U.S. officials told Fox News later Thursday.

The device, known as the Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System, deployed for the first time in January aboard the USS Kearsarge, the same class of warship as the USS Boxer.

Trump also called on other countries to condemn what he described as Iran’s attempts to disrupt the freedom of navigation and global commerce in the strategic waterway in the Persian Gulf region.

IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY 'HAD NO CHOICE' BUT TO BUILD MISSILES FOR DEFENSE

Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman confirmed to Fox News in a statement: ""At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz. A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.""

The president said the drone threatened the safety of the American ship and its crew.

Meantime, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Thursday he had ""no information about having lost a drone today.""

The latest actions came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran in the wake of the breakdown of the nuclear deal, as the secretive regime announced it exceeded the threshold of low-enriched uranium stockpile as agreed upon in the 2015 accord.

Iran’s state television said earlier Thursday that regime forces captured a foreign tanker with a crew of 12 accused of smuggling oil.

The tanker was seized by Revolutionary Guard forces on July 14 after getting intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island in the strategic Strait of Hormuz amid allegations that the tanker was smuggling fuel from Iranian smugglers to foreign customers.

Iran recently shot down a U.S. drone that it said was flying over Iran. Trump called off a planned retaliatory airstrike at the last minute.

Trump to Nominate Eugene Scalia for Labor Secretary Job,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Noam Scheiber', 'Michael Crowley']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/eugene-scalia-labor-secretary.html,"Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Thursday night that the selection of Mr. Scalia was a missed opportunity.

“President Trump has again chosen someone who has proven to put corporate interests over those of worker rights,” Mr. Schumer said. “Workers and union members who believed candidate Trump when he campaigned as pro-worker should feel betrayed.”

Mr. Scalia, 55, was nominated by Mr. Bush in 2001 to serve as solicitor of the Labor Department, but was never confirmed by the Senate, which was controlled by Democrats. Much of the fear about Mr. Scalia’s nomination was based on his opposition to a Clinton administration regulation that would have protected workers from repetitive stress injuries, which became known as the ergonomics rule. Mr. Scalia had weighed in frequently against the rule, deriding the rationale for it as “unreliable science.”

Mr. Bush eventually used a recess appointment to install Mr. Scalia in the position, effectively bypassing the Senate. He left the department in 2003 and returned to private practice.

A former subordinate of Mr. Scalia’s in the solicitor’s office, Ann Rosenthal, said she was appalled when he was nominated to the position after observing his opposition to the ergonomics rule. But she was pleasantly surprised to find him reasonable and relatively committed to protecting workers.

Ms. Rosenthal, who has since retired, recalled telling Mr. Scalia that he had far exceeded her expectations. “I have a different client now,” he responded.

Mr. Scalia represented a variety of corporate clients at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. In 2006, he helped Walmart triumph in a prominent fight against a Maryland law that would have required companies with more than 10,000 workers to either spend at least 8 percent of their payroll costs on health care, or pay into a state Medicaid fund."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed U.S. CBP after a report of a secret Facebook group that made fun of dead migrants. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshop images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

"Trump to nominate Gene Scalia, son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, for secretary of labor",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-nominate-gene-scalia-son-of-late-supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-for-secretary-of-labor,"President Trump on Thursday night announced he's nominating attorney Gene Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, to replace Alex Acosta as secretary of labor.

The surprise move -- which top Republicans privately supported -- was a visible manifestation of the close personal bond Trump has forged with the Scalia family in recent years. The confirmation process for Justice Neil Gorsuch, who ultimately filled Justice Scalia's seat, sparked the connection.

Acosta stepped down as head of the Labor Department last Friday over his past involvement in a cushy 2008 plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is now facing federal sex trafficking charges.

Acosta's resignation is to become official on Friday, when his deputy, Patrick Pizzella, will take over as acting Labor secretary pending Scalia's confirmation, officials said.

Scalia, 55, has been a partner in the Washington office of the international law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. He's expected to face headwinds from Democrats in his Senate confirmation hearings, in part because he routinely has represented major corporations in key cases involving workers' rights.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Scalia in a statement late Thursday.

""President Trump is missing an opportunity to nominate a fighter for workers, like a union member, to be America’s next Labor Secretary,"" Schumer said. ""Instead, President Trump has again chosen someone who has proven to put corporate interests over those of worker rights. Workers and union members who believed candidate Trump when he campaigned as pro-worker should feel betrayed.”

In 2005, Walmart hired Scalia to defend against whistleblower lawsuits by employees who alleged wrongdoing in the company. Scalia also helped overturn a Maryland law in 2006 that would have required big companies such as Walmart to spend more on employee health care in the state. That law ran afoul of a federal statute aimed at reducing red tape for certain national employers, who otherwise would have had to afford significantly different benefits to employees depending on their state of employment.

The Wall Street Journal wrote in 2012 that Scalia ""has emerged as one of the industry's go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.""

In some of his biggest cases, according to the Journal, Scalia ""focused on how regulators analyze the cost of new rules, building a legal strategy that echoes a political argument of Republican [then-] presidential candidate Mitt Romney—that added regulations are holding back the economy.""

""The government has to adhere to the law also and this is a country where if the government doesn't adhere to the law you can take them to court and get a remedy,"" Scalia said at the time.

The appointment would be something of a homecoming for Scalia, who served as the chief legal officer, or Solicitor, for the Labor Department under President George W. Bush.

EPSTEIN DENIED BAIL -- DESPITE OFFERING TO HIDE AWAY IN MANSION AND DEFINTIELY NOT FLY AWAY TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

In that role, he oversaw not only all Labor Department litigation, but also provided ""legal advice on rulemakings and administrative law,"" according to his biography on Gibson Dunn's website.

Additionally, Scalia was a special assistant to Attorney General Bill Barr -- when he was the attorney general for the first time, in President George H.W. Bush's administration. Scalia also was a speechwriter for Education Secretary William Bennett.

In 2018, Scalia secured a win for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by convincing a judge to overturn the Labor Department's Obama-era 2016 fiduciary rule governing retirement account advisers, which Scalia said had ""very serious problems."" A judge agreed with conservatives who said the Obama administration had ""overreached"" in how it classified advisers as fiduciaries, who were therefore obligated to act in their clients' best interests -- and put clients' interests ahead of concerns for their own compensation.

CHRISTOPHER SCALIA ADDRESSES LIBERAL ARGUMENTS TO EXPAND THE SUPREME COURT

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found fatal problems in how the rule defined advisers and ""financial advice,"" and critics said the rule made it harder to charge commissions and earn profit from advising smaller accounts.

Republicans, late Thursday, praised Scalia's nomination. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton called Scalia an ""outstanding lawyer who has vigorously defended the Constitution over a long career in government and private practice.""

He added, ""I’m confident he’ll be a champion for working Americans against red tape and burdensome regulation as Labor Secretary.""

In announcing Scalia's selection, Trump sounded notes of praise not only for the nominee, but also for his own administration.

""I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor,"" Trump wrote in a tweet late Thursday. ""Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience working with labor and everyone else.""

Trump added: ""He will be a great member of an Administration that has done more in the first 2 ½ years than perhaps any Administration in history!""

Trump has highlighted the late Justice Scalia's legacy repeatedly in recent years. Scalia's widow, Maureen, was at the Rose Garden ceremony last summer when Trump announced he would nominate Justice Brett Kavanaugh to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.

And, at a Medal of Freedom ceremony honoring the late justice at the White House last year, Trump joked about the fact Maureen and her husband, who died in 2016, had nine children together.

""You were very busy,"" Trump said, to laughter. ""Wow. Wow. I always knew I liked him.""

And in 2017, at his first address to a joint session of Congress, Trump recognized Maureen, and remarked that her husband would ""forever be a symbol of American justice."""
Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'July At Am', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."

Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer, but as a lawyer with great experience working with labor and everyone else,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. ""He will be a great member of an Administration that has done more in the first 2 ½ years than perhaps any Administration in history!""

Scalia will replace Acosta, the former Labor secretary who resigned following backlash over his role in negotiating a 2008 plea deal as the US attorney in Miami with Epstein, a well-connected multimillionaire.

Epstein avoided a federal trial at the time and served only 13 months in prison for state prostitution charges over his involvement with underage girls. A Miami Herald investigation published last November described the plea deal, negotiated by Acosta, as the ""deal of a lifetime.""

Epstein now faces accusations that he sexually abused dozens of teenage girls and is being held in jail without bail while he faces one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors related to alleged conduct that occurred between 2002 and 2005. He has pleaded not guilty.

Trump announced Acosta's resignation last week, to be effective Friday. He said at the time that Acosta would be replaced on an acting basis by the current deputy secretary, Pat Pizzella.

Scalia is currently a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, with a range of legal experience on labor and regulatory issues, according to his firm biography . In 2017, Scalia represented Bank of America against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in a lawsuit alleging that the bank owed $542 million to the government agency, which insures people's deposits against a bank failure.

Scalia previously served as the Labor department's top lawyer in 2002 under then-President George Bush, and as a special assistant to then-first time Attorney General Bill Barr at the Department of Justice in 1992.

Scalia has praised the friendship between his late father, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and fellow justice -- and near ideological opposite -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

""Whenever you have two such important, accomplished people who have a rich friendship like that, there's something to be learned from it,"" the younger Scalia told CNN's Poppy Harlow and Jeffrey Toobin last August.

""Their ability to engage on ideas and yet respect one another's abilities and maintain a friendship is an instructive lesson,"" he added. ""And I think they would both heartily agree that we want to have people on two sides of an issue to explain what the right answer is."""

“This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.) told The Washington Post.

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were around 20% to 25%.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save up to $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research."
EPA declines requests to ban pesticide chlorpyrifos,https://www.cnn.com,"['Gregory Wallace', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/politics/epa-chlorpyrifos/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency has decided against a ban of the widely-used pesticide chlorpyrifos, which critics say is associated with neurological problems in children.

The agency concluded there is not sufficient evidence of the chemical's dangers to justify the ban requested by environmental groups and a group of states. Those groups cast the decision as another example of the Trump administration siding with industry.

""EPA has determined that their objections must be denied because the data available are not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable to meet petitioners' burden to present evidence demonstrating that the tolerances are not safe,"" the agency said in a statement Thursday.

Critics say science shows chlorpyrifos is associated with neurological conditions in farm workers and their children.

The agency banned chlorpyrifos for household uses in 2000, but allowed agricultural producers to continue using it. That decision has been challenged through petitions and in the courts since 2007. Last summer, a federal court ordered the EPA to review the petition, and after a review of that decision, the agency was given 90 days in April to make a determination, culminating in Thursday's decision.

Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors' decision to end an investigation into hush money payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump relied at least in part on long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The Justice Department told a federal judge on Monday that it had ""effectively concluded"" its investigation into efforts to silence the women in the final months of the 2016 campaign, but did not explain why it had done so. Prosecutors have said the payoffs violated a federal law that restricts campaign donations.

A person familiar with the case, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said it was unclear whether prosecutors made a determination that they had sufficient evidence to bring a case against Trump or anyone other than his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year. But the Justice Department's opinion that a president cannot be indicted factored into the decision to end the probe, the person said.

Federal prosecutors had repeatedly placed Trump at the center of the effort to silence pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the chaotic run-up to the 2016 election. Last year, they alleged in a court filing that Cohen had orchestrated illegal hush-money payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. And it revealed in unsealed court records on Friday that Trump participated in phone calls about the payments to Daniels.

The judgment by federal prosecutors in New York to take no further action in the wide-ranging inquiry tracks a decision earlier this year by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who cited the same Justice Department policy when he declined to make a determination about whether Trump's efforts to derail that investigation amounted to a crime.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2000 that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution."" That view has never been tested in court but is binding on federal prosecutors.

As in the Mueller inquiry, which outlined 10 instances in which Trump sought to thwart the special counsel's inquiry, documents revealed Thursday put then-candidate Trump in middle of a frantic effort to fend off damaging disclosures about his personal conduct just a month before the 2016 election.

In the documents, the FBI described a series of conversations in the days after a leaked Access Hollywood outtake showed Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals about preventing Daniels from airing her own claims of having had an affair with Trump years earlier.

Authorities laid out a timeline of emails, text messages and phone calls – some involving Trump himself – that ""concerned the need to prevent"" Daniels from going public with her story.

Trump denied knowledge of the payments after they became public. But the FBI told a judge it had obtained telephone records showing he participated in some of the first conversations about the scheme, which prosecutors have said violated federal campaign finance laws.

Federal prosecutors said in court filings last year that Cohen orchestrated payments to Daniels and McDougal, ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. The documents unsealed Thursday offer the first clear account of the extent of Trump's involvement in that effort, as the Republican nominee's campaign floundered just weeks before the election.

Ultimately, it was Cohen – not Trump – who was charged and convicted for the scheme. He is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison related to tax evasion and the hush-money scheme that amounted to illegal campaign finance violations. He also pleaded guilty to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

""Cohen's commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,"" prosecutors asserted prior to Cohen's sentencing.

In the same document, however, prosecutors indicated that Cohen was acting on behalf of Trump who they then-described in gauzy law enforcement vernacular as ""Individual 1.""

""The investigation is over,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Thursday. He declined to address whether the current Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president blocked any further action contemplated by New York prosecutors.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

But from a federal prison in upstate New York, Cohen continued to claim that his conviction should not mark the end of an investigation that has long shadowed the White House.

""I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment,” Cohen said in a statement Thursday. “The conclusion of the investigation exonerating The Trump Organization's role should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and the Department of Justice.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the unsealed documents bolstered Cohen's assertions.

""The inescapable conclusion from all of the public materials available now is that there was ample evidence to charge Donald Trump with the same criminal election law violations for which Michael Cohen pled guilty,"" Schiff said.

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."

"The US shoots down an Iranian drone, and Trump draws a red line",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-us-shoots-down-an-iranian-drone-and-trump-draws-a-red-line,"Lamenting Iran's escalation, we should be glad the USS Boxer-led Amphibious Ready Group downed an Iranian drone on Thursday. That drone came within one kilometer of the Boxer before being destroyed.

This U.S. action should not be seen as retaliation for Iran's downing of a U.S. drone in June, but rather as an act of self-defense.

It is justified for two reasons.

First, because Iran uses armed drones as a keystone element of its four-pronged war-fighting strategy for the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (the other three elements being anti-ship missiles, mines, and fast attack boats). Second, because Iran conducted this operation to test U.S. resolve in face of overt threats to American personnel.

While it's not yet clear which type of drone was involved here, it was likely a Shahed 129 type drone. Armable with bombs, and possibly unguided rockets, Iran has previously used this platform to threaten American forces in the region. Regardless, while not nearly as advanced as U.S. military and intelligence drones, Iranian drones can threaten American personnel.

Again, on the available information, this was a justified action. Iran was repeatedly warned to withdraw the drone. The drone closed within 1 kilometer of the Boxer amphibious ready group before being shot down. And remember, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps builds and deploys its drones as a means of lethal threat.

Still, as I warned last month, this kind of Iranian test was always highly likely. The Iranian economy is in free fall and European Union appeasement has failed to restrain the hardliners' anger. Iran would have intended this drone action to threaten American lives in a credible and serious manner. The Boxer amphibious ready group is embarked with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit and over 2,000 Marines. So the perceived threat to life was significant, even if unarmed with bombs or missiles, the U.S. commander would have feared the drone might have been armed with explosives and intended to crash into the ship.

Shooting down the drone was the right action to take. Iran knows the United States will defend its personnel with all necessary force. Had the drone been allowed to approach closer, Iran would have been encouraged to escalate even further."
EPA will not ban chlorpyrifos,https://www.politico.com,['Liz Crampton'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/epa-will-not-ban-chlorpyrifos-1603479,"The EPA, in a notice that will be posted to the Federal Register, said further examination of epidemiological studies of health risks associated with chlorpyrifos is necessary before the agency can make a final decision on its safety. | AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais energy & environment EPA will not ban chlorpyrifos

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will not ban the use of chlorpyrifos, rejecting a request from environmental groups to prohibit the pesticide.

The action came in response to an appellate court decision earlier this year ordering the agency to respond to a petition from environmental groups that sought to ban the widely used pesticide. Research has shown that chlorpyrifos, which is commonly applied on fruit and vegetable crops, has the potential to damage brain development in children. Today was the final day EPA could respond under the court’s timeline.

Story Continued Below

The EPA, in a notice that will be posted to the Federal Register, said further examination of epidemiological studies of health risks associated with chlorpyrifos is necessary before the agency can make a final decision on its safety.

The agency said “there is good reason” to continue allowing farmers to use chlorpyrifos, “given the importance of this matter and the fact that critical questions remained regarding the significance of the data addressing neurodevelopmental effects.”

The EPA under the Obama administration was taking steps to ban the pesticide in 2015. But in March 2017 President Donald Trump's first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, denied a petition that sought to prohibit chlorpyrifos. It was an early move intended to further Trump's deregulatory agenda.

Pruitt declared EPA needed to ""provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos"" and said the agency would conduct more research before determining whether the pesticide should be removed from the market.

Environmentalists then sued the agency. In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to act within three months on the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, which was developed by Corteva.

The debate over chlorpyrifos has divided green groups and the agriculture industry. Environmentalists, citing research linking pesticide exposure to neurological damage, have pushed for decades for the government to prohibit chlorpyrifos. But the farm lobby argues the pesticide is an important crop protection tool and commodity groups have resisted efforts to ban its use.

The environmental groups behind the lawsuit blasted EPA's decision.

“By allowing chlorpyrifos to stay in our fruits and vegetables, Trump’s EPA is breaking the law and neglecting the overwhelming scientific evidence that this pesticide harms children’s brains,” said Patti Goldman, an attorney for Earthjustice.

Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement that government “leaders have a responsibility to protect our most vulnerable residents — our kids — but this administration chooses instead to protect its deep-pocketed allies in the chemical industry. Until EPA gets this stuff out of our fields and off our food, this fight is not over.”

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement provided to POLITICO that the issues environmental groups raised will be addressed through the agency’s review of chlorpyrifos' registration, a process that will be expedited “in response to requests from the public.” That review “should be completed well before the 2022 statutory deadline.”

The spokesperson added that the agency “has also been engaged in discussions with the chlorpyrifos registrants that could result in further use limitations affecting the outcome of EPA’s assessment.”

In the absence of federal action, some states have implemented their own bans. Hawaii and New York have prohibited chlorpyrifos, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in May that the state would move forward with a ban as well.

This is the second major pesticide action EPA has taken this month. The agency said last week it would expand use of the insecticide sulfoxaflor on a variety of crops for which it had previously been prohibited due to research showing the chemical is harmful to pollinators.

"U.S. Justice Department may sue to block Sprint, T-Mobile merger: source",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobileus/doj-may-sue-to-block-sprint-t-mobile-merger-cnbc-idUSKCN1UD23C,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has told T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp to wrap up a deal by the end of next week to sell assets that are to be divested as a condition of their proposed merger or face a lawsuit aimed at stopping the transaction, a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo

T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

CNBC was the first to report the ultimatum.

In June, a group of U.S. state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to block the merger of the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, arguing that the proposed $26 billion deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.

To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.

The companies have been in talks for weeks to sell Boost to Dish Network Corp but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future. T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom, which owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, are seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.

Sprint is controlled by Softbank Group Corp.

The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.

The two companies have a July 29 deadline to complete the deal but are expected to extend it.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has given his blessing to the merger in principle and is expected to circulate a formal order within weeks."

House Votes To Condemn Trump's 'Racist Comments',https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742236610/condemnation-of-president-delayed-by-debate-can-lawmakers-call-trump-tweets-raci,"House Votes To Condemn Trump's 'Racist Comments'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

Updated at 7:05 p.m. ET

The House of Representatives approved a resolution Tuesday evening condemning the president for a series of racist tweets about four Democratic lawmakers.

The vote was mostly along party lines, as the House split 240-187, with four Republicans supporting the nonbinding measure.

Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Susan Brooks of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas joined with Democrats to rebuke the president, as did Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party to become an independent.

The House was paralyzed for a substantial portion of the afternoon over legislative procedure. Republicans sought a ruling on the question: Does calling the president's tweets ""racist"" violate the rules of decorum established in the House?

So an already heated debate turned to farce as the House voted on whether to sanction House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for characterizing the president's remarks as ""racist,"" as part of a debate on a resolution that also calls the president's remarks ""racist.""

At issue was the phrasing of Pelosi as she spoke in favor of the resolution.

""Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets,"" she said. ""To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.""

GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, objected to the language, calling it ""unparliamentary,"" and called for her comments to be ""taken down"" — officially removed from the record. When that happens, the lawmaker is no longer allowed to speak on the House floor for the remainder of the day.

House rules prohibit impugning the motives of a person during legislative debate. There is no explicit rule that states that lawmakers cannot call comments ""racist,"" but there is precedent for declaring these sorts of characterizations out of bounds. The rules and precedents are outlined in Jefferson's Manual, which lays out parliamentary procedures.

As House staff and lawmakers huddled to sort out what to do and expected a decision, the presiding chair of the House, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., unexpectedly dropped his gavel and declared that he was ""abandoning the chair.""

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer later delivered the ruling that Pelosi's words were not in order, but Democrats defeated a vote to strike them from the official congressional record.

Both the attempted sanctioning of the speaker of the House and Cleaver's decision to walk off the floor and leave the House without a presiding officer are highly unusual developments in the House.

The resolution states that the House ""strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.""

The president's weekend comments about four female members of Congress have done what Trump's remarks so often do: take control of the agenda in Washington, D.C.

As the weekend began, lawmakers expected that this week would be focused primarily on issues like a proposal to raise the minimum wage, a budget deal and a vote holding the attorney general in contempt over the 2020 census.

The president's tweets upended the whole order. His tweets, in which he implored four women of color to ""go back"" to the ""places from which they came,"" dominated the conversation in the capital — with Democrats condemning it and Republicans being asked to defend or denounce it.

The statements targeted four freshman progressive lawmakers: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All but Omar were born in the United States.

In response to the president's comments, Ocasio-Cortez responded that telling ""four American Congresswomen of color"" to "" 'go back to your own country' "" reflects the ""hallmark language of white supremacists.""

Ahead of the debate on the House floor, Democrats were warned to watch their language.

In a meeting with his Democratic colleagues Tuesday morning, Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., reminded lawmakers about the House rules saying they cannot impugn the personal motives of the president. Pelosi suggested to the caucus that they could use phrasing like his ""words were racist,"" noting that such nuance allows them to make their point and stick within the rules.

While some Republicans in the House and Senate have criticized the president's comments, GOP leadership in the House of Representatives stood with the president.

Asked if the president's tweets were racist, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that they weren't. He added that he planned to vote against the Democratic resolution, dismissing it as ""it's all politics.""

House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney declined to address the president's comments directly, instead focusing on attacking the left.

""Our opposition to our colleague's beliefs has absolutely nothing to do with race or gender or religion,"" she told reporters. ""We oppose them and their policies because their policies are dangerous and wrong and would destroy America."""
Trump’s EPA Won’t Ban Pesticide Linked To Brain Damage In Kids,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Condé Nast', 'Bess Levin', 'Kenzie Bryant', 'Bess Levi', 'Eric Lutz']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/donald-trump-epa-chlorpyrifos,"In a normal universe, like the one we inhabited until January 20, 2017, it would be considered a no-brainer to outlaw the use of a pesticide linked to neurological damage in children. That‘s why, in 2015, the Obama administration proposed to revoke all uses of chlorpyrifos, exposure to which studies had shown led to lower birth weight and reduced IQ, among a host of harmful effects. Then Trump became president and, well you can probably guess where this is going:

…before the ban was finalized, President Trump took office and reversed course.… In a notice to the Federal Register on Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency wrote that “critical questions remained regarding the significance of the data” that suggests that chlorpyrifos causes neurological damage in young children. The agency said that the Obama administration’s decision to ban the product—used on more than 50 crops, including grapes, broccoli, and strawberries—was based on epidemiological studies rather than direct tests on animals, which have historically been used by the EPA to determine a pesticide’s safety. The EPA’s decision, which represented a win for industry, drew swift condemnation from groups that have pushed for years to remove the pesticide from the market.

Presumably, one of the groups extremely happy with the decision was Dow Chemical, which sells approximately 5 million pounds of chlorpyrifos in the U.S. each year, according to the Associated Press, and wasn’t about to let one of its biggest moneymakers get banned; in 2017, per the AP, Dow and two other companies that manufacture chlorpyrifos sent letters to the EPA, the Department of Commerce, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, asking them to “set aside” the results of studies indicating harmful effects, claiming that they were “fundamentally flawed.” They even hired scientists to “produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies.” Oh, and don’t forget that Dow donated $1 million to underwrite Trump’s inaugural festivities, though anyone even entertaining the idea that the seven-figure check was intended to grease the administration’s wheels should put a sock in it. Rachelle Schikorra, Dow’s director of public affairs, told the AP at the time that any such suggestion was “completely off the mark.”

The administration’s move to keep chlorpyrifos on the market comes as states like California and New York have taken steps to ban the pesticide outright. In May, California health officials said they did so in light of strong evidence that it “causes serious health effects in children and other sensitive populations at lower levels of exposure than previously understood.”

“Today’s decision is shameful,” Kristin Schafer, executive director of the Pesticide Action Network, told the Washington Post. “It flies in the face of decades of strong scientific evidence, and the recommendations of the agency’s own scientists. This administration is putting children, workers and rural families across the country at continued risk for no good reason, and we will continue to press for a full federal ban of this dangerous chemical. This administration has made perfectly clear who they are working for.”

"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

EPA allows continued use of pesticide linked with brain damage,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453777-epa-allows-continued-use-of-pesticide-linked-with-brain-damage,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will not halt a pesticide linked with brain damage from being sprayed on crops, the agency said Thursday in response to a lawsuit.

Chlorpyrifos, known on the market as Lorsban, is used on a wide variety of crops, including corn and cranberries, and farmers often call it a last line of defense against certain insects.

A federal appeals court in April gave the EPA 90 days to decide how to deal with the pesticide.

Environmental groups have long contended it’s dangerous and have spent years suing the EPA to end its agricultural use. Studies have linked chlorpyrifos to learning and memory issues and prolonged nerve and muscle stimulation. ADVERTISEMENT

In a statement to The Hill, the EPA said the groups challenging chlorpyrifos’s use did not have enough data to demonstrate the product is not safe. The EPA said it would continue to review the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022.

Chlorpyrifos has already been banned for household use and seemed on track to be phased out more broadly, but that shifted under the Trump administration.

In the absence of EPA action, some states have moved to regulate chlorpyrifos on their own. Hawaii in 2018 banned the use of the pesticide across the state. California and New York are considering a similar move.

California, the nation’s top agricultural state, said it was obligated to take action due to research showing chlorpyrifos hinders brain development in children.

Farmers and other groups have urged the EPA to keep chlorpyrifos available.

“Without the ability to use chlorpyrifos, entire production fields could be lost,” the American Seed Trade Association wrote in a letter to the agency in 2017.

“As a mother of two young sons, it’s alarming that the food in school meals could contain even a trace of a chemical that could harm students’ development and ability to learn,” Gillibrand, who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in a statement at the time.

Environmental groups knocked the agency’s decision Thursday.

“By allowing chlorpyrifos to stay in our fruits and vegetables, Trump’s EPA is breaking the law and neglecting the overwhelming scientific evidence that this pesticide harms children’s brains,” said Patti Goldman, an attorney for Earthjustice. “It is a tragedy that this administration sides with corporations instead of children’s health.”

The organizations that originally brought the challenge to EPA on the rule said they will continue to fight the decision.

“Every day we go without a ban, children and farm workers are eating, drinking and breathing a pesticide linked to intellectual and learning disabilities and poisonings,” said the 12 plaintiff organizations that challenged the 2017 decision.

“We will continue to fight until chlorpyrifos is banned and children and farm workers are safe from this dangerous chemical.”"
"U.S. House holds Barr, Ross in criminal contempt over census documents",https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Jan']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/17/us-house-holds-barr-ross-in-criminal-contempt-over-census-documents/23771724/,"WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for defying congressional subpoenas related to the U.S. census.

The measure, which passed 230-198, was a response to the cabinet members' failure to produce documents requested by House Democrats as part of an investigation into whether the Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census that would discriminate against racial minorities.

Four Democrats voted against the measure, while no Republicans supported it. Justin Amash, an independent congressman from Michigan who recently left the Republican Party, voted in favor of the resolution.

The criminal contempt vote against the two Trump cabinet members is likely to be little more than symbolic since the charges would be referred to Barr's Justice Department.

Still, the maneuver intensified a Democratic assault on President Donald Trump's stonewalling of congressional probes.

Earlier on Wednesday, Barr and Ross urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to delay the vote, saying she should ""allow the constitutionally mandated accommodation process to continue.""

""House Democrats never sought to have a productive relationship with the Trump administration, and today's PR stunt further demonstrates their unending quest to generate headlines instead of operating in good faith with our department,"" Ross said in a statement.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month blocked Trump's initial effort to add the citizenship question. He then planned an executive order to add it to the census, but later dropped the idea.

""Holding any cabinet secretary in criminal contempt of Congress is a serious and somber matter - one that I have done everything in my power to avoid,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is conducting the census investigation.

""But in this case, the attorney general and Secretary Ross have blatantly obstructed our ability to do congressional oversight into the real reason Secretary Ross was trying - for the first time in 70 years - to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census,"" he added.

Wednesday's vote marked the first time Trump administration officials have been held in criminal contempt of Congress since Democrats took control of the House in January. Prior to the vote there had been only one other instance in U.S. history of Congress holding a sitting cabinet official in contempt.

In 2012, congressional Republicans held then President Barack Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over his refusal to produce documents relating to the ""Operation Fast and Furious"" gun trafficking investigation.

"NFL preview 2019: Derek Carr, three other possible MVP sleepers in AFC",https://www.nbcsports.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/raiders/nfl-preview-2019-derek-carr-three-other-possible-mvp-sleepers-afc,"With training camps getting started, hope once again springs eternal in the NFL.

Tom Brady and the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots are primed to defend their crown, but a pack of worthy challengers is frothing at the mouth for the chance to take down the king.

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes sits atop the NFL's other throne as The Shield's reigning league MVP. The dynamic signal-caller once again is viewed as the favorite to take home the hardware, and while the like of Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Baker Mayfield, Carson Wentz, Andrew Luck and Philip Rivers are viewed as the most likely to take the crown from Mahomes, the AFC has a few other young passers who are lying in wait.

When looking at possible MVP sleepers in the AFC, I made sure to look only at players that had odds at 80-to-1 or higher, as listed by Westgate Las Vegas. With the framework set, here are four potential MVP sleepers who reside in the AFC.

Derek Carr, QB, Raiders

The Case For: Carr has the arm talent and the leadership qualities to be an MVP. We saw that in 2016 when he led the Raiders to a 12-3 record before fracturing his fibula in Week 16. With a wealth of offensive talent around -- including Antonio Brown and Tyrell Williams, -- and a full year of Jon Gruden's system under his belt, it wouldn't be hard to see Carr returning to his MVP-caliber form in 2019. If he puts up big numbers while helping the Raiders navigate a tough early-season schedule, he should be in the mix.

The Case Against: There was little about the Raiders' offense in 2018 that would tell you a turn around is coming. The offensive line struggled and the running game was relatively non-existent. This is a make or break year for the Carr-Gruden relationship and there's a chance it just won't work.

Deshaun Watson, QB, Texans

The Case For: Despite a shaky offensive line, Watson completed 68.3 percent of his passes while throwing for 4,165 yards, 26 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also rushed for 551 yards and five scores. If the Clemson product can get some protection, he could put up big numbers and lead the Texans to another AFC West title. The recipe for an MVP campaign is there for Watson.

The Case Against: The offensive line is atrocious. Watson might spend more time running for his life than looking downfield for the streaking DeAndre Hopkins. If the Texans can't keep Watson off his back, there will be no MVP delusions in Houston.

Marcus Mariota, QB, Titans

The Case For: When he's been healthy, Mariota has put up good numbers. That was with an offense designed for the 1940s with one offensive weapon. Mariota enters a make-or-break year for him with the Titans with two new wide receivers in rookie A.J. Brown and former Buccaneers Adam Humphries. If new offensive coordinator Arthur Humphries can tailor the offense to Mariota's strengths, the possibility for a breakout season is there.

The Case Against: Look, he hasn't been able to stay healthy. If Mariota can't stay on the field, then his chance at winning the MVP and the Titans' playoff hopes go in the trash can.

[RELATED: How Raiders' defense stacks up against AFC West rivals]

Lamar Jackson, QB, Ravens

The Case For: Jackson rushed for 556 yards in the seven games he started last season. If you extrapolate that over a 16-game season, it amounts to 1,271 yards. That would be more than the 1,039 yards Michael Vick rushed for in 2006. If Jackson has improved his passing and leads the Ravens to the playoffs, he could very well be an MVP sleeper.

The Case Against: As the Los Angeles Chargers showed in the AFC Wild Card Game, it's easy to stop Jackson if he's only able to move the chains with his legs. If the Louisville product hasn't made big strides with his accuracy and pocket presence then he won't be in the MVP conversation."
Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia,https://www.politico.com,['Eliana Johnson'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/state-russia-pompeo-andrea-thompson-1417602,"State Department official Andrea Thompson’s planned presence at a meeting with Russia’s foreign minister raised concerns after it was revealed she had failed to disclose ties to Maria Butina. | Thomas Peter/AP Photo foreign policy Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia The official, Andrea Thompson, stands accused of failing to disclose ties to a GOP operative caught up in the Maria Butina affair.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Story Continued Below

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""
USDA Identifies Two Monsanto Strains in Rogue GMO Wheat in Washington State,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-identifies-two-monsanto-strains-in-rogue-gmo-wheat-in-washington-state,"The GMO wheat discovered growing wild in a Washington State field this spring actually sprouted from two different strains developed by Monsanto, the USDA announced over the weekend. Genetically engineered wheat is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world, yet volunteer herbicide-resistant plants have been confirmed four times in the U.S. Northwest more than a decade after field trials ended.

In the latest case, USDA said “thorough testing” identified the wheat as Monsanto strains MON 71300 and MON 71800. The MON 71800 strain also was identified in the first U.S. case of rogue GMO wheat, in eastern Oregon in 2013. The same strain was found growing wild in 2014 at a Montana State University research farm in Huntley, Montana. A different strain, MON 71700, was found in 22 wheat plants in a field in Washington State in 2016.

“There is no evidence that any GE wheat has entered commerce or is in the food supply,” said USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in an update of the new case. It has issued similar conclusions on the past incidents. And, as in the past, it cited the FDA position that there would be no safety concerns if low levels of the wheat varieties were present in the food supply.

A test kit will be offered to U.S. trading partners to identify MON 71300, said the APHIS. Previously, the USDA has provided test kits for the two other strains. Japan and South Korea, two major importers of wheat from the U.S. Northwest, have tested wheat shipments for GMO content since 2013 and have not found issues with the U.S. grain.

Unlike previous incidents, neither Japan nor South Korea interrupted purchases of U.S. wheat following the announcement of rogue wheat in Washington State. Last year, the two countries halted purchases of Canadian wheat for a month due to confirmation of GE wheat along an access road in southern Alberta.

Washington State often is the fourth-largest wheat-growing state in the nation. The Washington Grain Commission says 85% to 90% of the state’s wheat is exported, mainly to Pacific Rim nations.

In the three other U.S. incidents, the USDA did not identify the source of the wheat seeds or how a GMO variety survived in the wild. In all of the incidents, the plants attracted attention because they did not die when sprayed with a weedkiller. Monsanto genetically modified wheat to tolerate doses of Roundup herbicide.

The Trump administration is a supporter of U.S. agricultural biotechnology. President Trump signed an executive order in mid-June to modernize ag biotech and, referring to gene-edited crops and livestock, told the USDA, FDA, and EPA to use their existing powers “to exempt low-risk products of agricultural biotechnology for undue regulation.”

Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/453525-treasury-department-bureaucrats-risk-jumpstarting-islamic-state,"It has now been 21 months since Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces and U.S. air support, moved into Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Earlier this month, I spoke at a Rojava Centre for Strategic Studies conference in Amudeh, Syria, exploring the Islamic State’s enablers, after which I had the opportunity to visit Raqqa as the local administration’s guest.

To enter Raqqa is to be overwhelmed by destruction. Thousands of former residents remain in tents at a camp alongside the road outside Ayn Issa. Most would like to return to their homes just 45 minutes’ drive away, but Raqqa remains largely destroyed. Driving into town requires passing the shells of apartment buildings stretching miles. Local authorities have given a face lift to Naim Square, where the Islamic State executed prisoners and mounted their heads, and rebranded it Freedom Square. The buildings facing the square, however, remain bombed out.

There are signs of life in the center of town: wedding dresses, children’s toys, and sweets sold in shops surrounded by rubble. Children played soccer in a stadium once used as the Islamic State’s chief prison. Graffiti on the stadium wall cursed the Islamic State and expressed love for Taylor Swift Taylor Alison SwiftPoll: Michelle Obama most admired woman in the world Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence Warren signs Taylor Swift's Equality Act petition MORE. Unexploded ordnance slows recovery, as workers clear rubble by hand, and tempers are short. The biggest obstacle to Raqqa’s recovery, however, lies in Washington rather than Syria: The U.S. Treasury Department has been sitting on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver for the Syrian Democratic Council for four years.

Opposition groups in Syria can be an alphabet soup of acronyms but, in short, the Syrian Democratic Council is the umbrella organization for pro-American Syrian Kurdish militias like the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the all-female Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

When I first visited northeastern Syria in January 2014, U.S. diplomats had refused to talk to the Syrian Kurdish opposition out of deference to Turkey. The United States reconsidered its position due to both Kurds’ effectiveness against the Islamic State and Turkey’s double-dealing on terrorism. The United States began talking to the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in December 2015, and almost immediately, the SDC applied for a U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver so that they could hire American companies to participate in reconstruction and so that they could spend their own money in the United States. The SDC does not ask for handouts: one of the biggest differences between my most recent trip and my first is that the oil derricks between Qamishli and the Tigris River are now operating but absent a waiver, the SDC cannot legally spend money in the United States or elsewhere.

It is unclear whether inertia or a misguided strategy motivates OFAC to sit for years on the pending SDC waiver: The group is pro-Western and cooperates closely with Washington. The Treasury Department previously granted the Syrian National Council, the political arm of the Free Syrian Army, a waiver even though extremists and terrorists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army. In contrast, U.S. military members in Syria trust the SDF more than local partners in Iraq or Afghanistan; there has not been a single instance of SDF men or women turning on American mentors.

The Treasury Department’s inaction not only handicaps diplomacy but also undercuts U.S. strategy.

Isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains a core U.S. interest. The Kurds dislike Assad: He voided citizenship papers Kurds need for school and employment, and imprisoned Kurdish activists. However, given Turkey’s support for Islamist radicals and its anti-Kurdish ethnic cleaning in areas of Syria the Turkish army occupies, Syrian Kurds fear Turkey more. Simply put, Treasury’s failure is pushing pro-American Kurds back toward Assad.

Numerous diplomats castigate the Iraqi government for its failure to reconstruct Mosul after it was damaged first by Islamic State conquest and then its liberation. Diplomats fear frustration could fuel Islamic State resurgence. The same is now true with Raqqa, where frustration is palpable. The only difference is that if Raqqa erupts, the blame will not be on a foreign government, but on the glacial pace of the U.S. government’s own bureaucracy.

Here’s What We Know About The BLM’s Move To Grand Junction,https://www.cpr.org,['Caitlyn Kim Stina Sieg'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.cpr.org/2019/07/16/heres-what-we-know-about-the-blms-move-to-grand-junction/,"Updated 2:41 p.m.

The Bureau of Land Management was born on July 16, 1946. That same date will soon carry another significance for the agency that manages the country’s public lands.

It’s also the day they confirmed that the BLM will move out of Washington, D.C. A letter that outlines the move (which you can read below) was sent to Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the chair of the Subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

Sen. Cory Gardner broke the news Monday with a video on Twitter, but the announcement was short on details. Here’s what CPR has learned so far:

27 positions will relocate to Grand Junction, including the director, deputy director and their attendant staff. Gardner thinks it is important that the decision makers are moving.

222 employees will move to BLM state offices.

85 total employees will relocate to Colorado. 54 positions will be divided between the state office and the National Operations Center in Lakewood and 4 additional positions go to the state office.

74 positions will be reallocated to state offices and report to state directors.

61 will remain in Washington D.C. at the headquarters of the Department of Interior.

“Shifting critical leadership positions and supporting staff to western states — where an overwhelming majority of federal lands are located — is not only a better management system, it is beneficial to the interest of the American public in these communities, cities, counties, and states,” said Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt in a statement.

Bernhardt is a Colorado native from the west slope city of Rifle, about 60 miles to the east of Grand Junction.

Gardner has advocated for the Junction move since 2016 and said it would make the city “the gateway to public lands.” And that will not only bring prestige but the economic benefit of people who come out for meetings, stay at hotels and spend money in local shops and restaurants.

It is his understanding that Interior has the authority to relocate the BLM, but the plan may still undergo congressional review. The Republican senator said somebody could “obviously, try to throw a wrench into the works, but I think this will move forward. And by the fall we’ll have thedirector of the BLM in Colorado, in Grand Junction.”

A spokesperson for the House Appropriations Committee told CPR that the “proposed restructuring and move constitutes a reprogramming” and would require the approval of the committee.

The relocation of two agencies within the United State Department of Agriculture to Kansas City has been criticized by employees. Nothing similar has been publicly stated with regard to the BLM. Jason Briefel, the executive director of the Senior Executives Association said he has not spoken to their BLM members about this latest round of restructuring.

The group, however, had concerns when the BLM relocated dozens of senior executives in 2017.

“The agency did not comply with legal requirements; ignored regulatory guidance; and had no documented plan, methodology, or real business case that justified their actions,” the organization said at the time. Many ofthese concerns remain for Briefel.

“Congress has passed laws directing agencies to thoughtfully plan for and how to manage their people,” he said. “Most agencies do a bad job of it.”

In the interview, former EPA head Gina McCarthy expected the Trump administration’s backwardness on climate change—but not on no-brainers like limits on power plant mercury emissions and auto industry regulation, both of which were being complied with. “They’re just obsessed with undoing everything Obama did. You can tell this with Trump. He’s still somehow campaigning against Obama.” McCarthy was the EPA’s administrator from 2013 to 2017, and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.

State Department bureaucratic bloat undercuts Syria and Islamic State strategies,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/state-department-bureaucratic-bloat-undercuts-syria-and-islamic-state-strategies,"AMUDEH, Syria — On the day I left Syria, Special Envoy James Jeffrey visited to try to sell local leaders on his proposal for a buffer zone between Syrian Kurds and Turkey. America’s Kurdish allies listened politely, but confused. For the past 11 months, Jeffrey has been the “special representative for Syria Engagement and special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.” The Syrian Defense Forces were the tip of the spear to defeat ISIS and were largely successful. Their civilian counterpart, the Syrian Democratic Council, runs northeastern Syria generally with tolerance and efficiency on very little income. Schools operate, municipalities pick up garbage, and the region even boasts its own cellphone company.

To unravel that stability and security in a flawed attempt to appease Turkey is unwise. It is also not clear it is consensus U.S. policy.

Over the last several decades, special envoy positions have proliferated for the simple reason that the State Department bureaucracy can suffocate policy implementation. Under normal circumstances, the State Department is slow and unwieldy. The bureaucracy is byzantine and beset by petty turf fights that undercut cooperation to a common cause. Nor does every issue conform neatly to preexisting bureaucracy. The fight against ISIS, for example, initially involved Syria and Iraq (two different State Department desks), and coalition affairs mandated interactions with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, among other countries.

Still, most State Department reform efforts single out the proliferation of special envoys that often impose a bureaucracy upon an existing bureaucracy. A 2001 Council on Foreign Relations’ Independent Task Force report , for example, called on the State Department to “Reduce appointment and use of special envoys.” A separate Brookings Institution report the same year also found negatives to outweigh positives regarding special envoys. “Such innovations may provide political cover against charges that the administration is ignoring a foreign policy issue critical to a vocal constituency,” Clinton administration National Security Council officials Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay wrote , “but they undercut the nation’s diplomatic establishment.”

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson targeted the envoy positions in his anemic reform attempts, but his successor Mike Pompeo resurrected many positions. In September 2018, career Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne authored a Wilson Center report finding “the use of stand-alone special envoys or representatives should remain limited to a few roles of high importance and be well integrated into existing 'bureaus' and interagency structures. Otherwise, these ‘specials’ will likely add to the silos and bureaucratic infighting that have long complicated efforts to produce and implement a coherent foreign policy, and they can contribute to fragmented international policy.”

Back to Syria and Iraq: While Jeffrey is a special envoy, he is of equal rank to Joel Rayburn , deputy assistant secretary for Levant Affairs and special envoy for Syria. Add into the mix William Roebuck , deputy special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and senior adviser to the special representative for Syria engagement who, grandiose title aside, acts as an informal ambassador often resident in northeastern Syria. Perhaps such special envoys were needed for the year plus in which Sen. Tim Kaine prevented a confirmation vote on the Trump administration’s pick to be assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs. But David Schenker assumed his post last month and so in theory should also oversee Levant policy.

It’s not just the State Department that is confused. Surveying senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad and Syrian Kurdish officials at a counter-ISIS conference in Amudeh, Syria, earlier this month, few officials had a clear notion of which American officials were in charge and whether the emphases of each interlocutor were personal or reflective of policy. In short, Iraqis and Syrian officials say some U.S. officials are pro-Turkish, others seem to emulate Lawrence of Arabia in their infatuation with Arab tribal politics, and others still are relatively seeking to make their voices heard.

The bottom line is Syria policy is broken, but the proliferation of diplomats taking charge only makes matters worse. Every additional envoy or diplomat working on Syria and Iraq gives Syrian and Iraqi officials a reason for confusion or an excuse to feign confusion. Five years ago, it may have made sense for the Obama administration to embrace a special envoy position to defeat the ISIS but, with that group no longer controlling territory, it makes far more sense to return to a more traditional State Department structure.

Certainly it is ironic that, for all the criticism that Trump made of President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry during his campaign, Trump's team appears intent on replicating their bureaucratic bloat at the expense of effective policy creation and execution.

U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Iraqi Militia Leaders and Ex-Governors,https://www.nytimes.com,['Edward Wong'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/us-sanctions-iraq.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is imposing economic sanctions on two former provincial governors and two militia leaders in Iraq, it announced on Thursday, citing human rights abuses in the north of the country.

American officials had determined that three of the four Iraqis were involved in acts of corruption, extortion and intimidation in Nineveh Province, which has minority populations of Christians and Yazidis and was an Islamic State stronghold before the group’s territorial defeat.

The Treasury Department said it was imposing the sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the executive branch to use economic penalties to punish officials of other nations for human rights violations.

“We will continue to hold accountable persons associated with serious human rights abuse, including persecution of religious minorities, and corrupt officials who exploit their positions of public trust to line their pockets and hoard power at the expense of their citizens,” said Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence."

EPA worker rights under White House assault,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/453710-epa-worker-rights-under-white-house-assault,"Last week, the Trump administration executed another step in its plan to dismantle the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Step one was appointing agency leaders who don’t support EPA’s mission. Step two was throwing out rules designed to protect the public from pollution and from climate change. Now comes step three: stripping EPA employees of rights and unilaterally changing employment conditions that are essential to maintaining a functioning workplace.

While running for office in 2016, Donald Trump told Fox News that, if elected, he would dismantle EPA to the point where there would be only “little tidbits left.” Unless Congress steps in, this goal will soon be in sight.

On July 8 – the same day President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to 'Send her back' chants at Trump rally: 'This is how history's worst episodes begin' McConnell: Trump 'on to something' with attacks on Dem congresswomen Trump blasts 'corrupt' Puerto Rico's leaders amid political crisis MORE gave a fantastical speech boasting of “incredible” environmental achievements – his administration announced it was throwing out years of past agreements between EPA management and our union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and imposing new workplace edicts on two-thirds of the workforce as AFGE represents nearly 8,000 EPA workers.

These new workplace rules, which were not negotiated with the union and not agreed to by employees, will have far-reaching consequences on employees and the work that they do.

For instance, the new directive nearly eliminates the option for most employees to work from alternative work locations closer to where they live. For an agency that is supposed to be committed to reducing carbon emissions, minimizing commutes for its own employees should be a high priority. Over the past decade, EPA has steadily increased the availability of telework to the point where many employees rely heavily on that option – not only to reduce commute times, but to balance childcare and other obligations. With that option yanked away, many employees will choose other employment alternatives – especially any that are closer to home.

Additionally, the unilateral directive denies workers due process by limiting workers’ access to grievance procedures and preventing union representatives from meeting with employees and managers to resolve disputes. Denying workers due process in this way creates an untenable work situation for employees.

In the Bay Area, this action initially and primarily hurts the staff-level attorneys who work at EPA’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office (EPA Region 9) in San Francisco and are members of AFGE Local 1236. They handle mission-critical cases that include cleaning up Superfund sites, pursuing clean air and clean water cases in court, prosecuting environmental crimes, cleaning up oil spills, enforcing hazardous waste and toxic substances laws, and much more – all to protect the American public and the environment from diverse and complex environmental burdens and disasters. And they have been doing this vital work despite severe staffing and budget cuts over the past several years.

Unfortunately, the administration’s attack on our workplace rights and protections isn’t isolated to EPA. At agency after agency – Education, Health and Human Services, Social Security, Veterans Affairs – political appointees are hijacking the collective bargaining process in an attempt to force through anti-worker provisions. Many of these proposals mirror those contained in three executive orders President Trump issued in May 2018 that were subsequently ruled illegal by a federal judge.

The administration’s rejection of labor rights is part of a broader effort to silence federal workers and gut workplace rights. It is precisely these benefits that make it possible for many of those employees to stay at the EPA, working toward a cleaner and safer environment for all of us.

If the administration succeeds in enforcing these anti-labor directives, EPA and other federal agencies will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining employees who perform critical services on behalf of our country. That is clearly the intent of the Trump administration, which sees federal employees as the enemy.

As employees leave the agency, most are never replaced, and access to clean air and clean water and safe places for our families to live and play will steadily dwindle. We all need to let our senators and congressional representatives know that we value the work of the EPA and other federal agencies and ask them to intervene before the damage that is being done to EPA and other agencies across the government becomes permanent.
