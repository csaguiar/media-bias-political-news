Madeleine Westerhout: Trump's personal assistant abruptly exits White House,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jim Acosta', 'Kaitlan Collins', 'Noah Gray', 'Pamela Brown', 'Paul Leblanc']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/politics/trump-personal-assistant-madeleine-westerhout/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's personal assistant, who's been with him since the start of his administration, has abruptly left the White House after sharing intimate details about the President's family with reporters, multiple people tell CNN.

A former White House official told CNN that Trump was close with Westerhout -- whose office was directly in front of the Oval Office -- but discussing personal information about his family was a red line.

Her ouster marks yet another departure from an administration beset by a series of exits by high-ranking officials , and it underlines the President's battle against the extensive leaks out of the White House and his greater campaign against the press.

A person familiar with the dinner at the Embassy Suites hotel in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey -- where reporters stay during Trump's visits -- said Westerhout and deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley attended a dinner alongside several reporters during his most recent trip.

These dinners are common during the President's trips and are typically treated as off the record, as was this one.

Westerhout's abrupt departure came as a surprise to her colleagues who had no idea about the matter, several people told CNN. She was seen as someone loyal to Trump and a true believer in his policies, sources said, though it has been reported in two books she was in tears when he won on Election Night.

Before joining the Trump administration, Westerhout served as the assistant to Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, who later became a senior adviser to the Trump transition team.

In this role, Westerhout was frequently seen escorting key members of the Trump's transition team through the Trump Tower lobby.

""The President-elect wanted to make sure all of his meetings were very transparent, so it became a little bit more public than I originally thought it was going to be,"" she told CNN in 2016."
Anti-Trump host Donny Deutsch loses MSNBC show: reports,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-trump-host-donny-deutsch-loses-msnbc-show-report,"After just 13 episodes, MSNBC has pulled the plug on “Saturday Night Politics,” a show hosted by Donny Deutsch, a staunch critic of President Trump.

The show never caught on with viewers, finishing far behind Fox News’ “Watters World” with Jesse Watters, according to The Hill.

It’s far from the first cancellation for Deutsch, whose CNBC show “The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch,” was scrapped in 2008. His other shows were trashed in 2010, 2013 and 2015, according to TV Newser.

MSNBC'S LAWRENCE O'DONNELL APOLOGIZES FOR UNVERIFIED TRUMP-RUSSIA REPORT: 'WE ARE RETRACTING THE STORY'

Applying some positive spin in his Thursday tweet announcing he had lost his latest gig, Deutsch noted for fans that his MSNBC show was the liberal network’s “highest rated Saturday night program EVER!”

Deutsch added that he will continue to appear on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” hosted by another Trump critic, former U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough.

Back in May, Deutsch appeared on “Morning Joe” and asserted that Trump was capable of deliberately sparking a civil war in the U.S.

“I’m not speaking hyperbole,” Deutsch said at the time.

In July, Deutsch blasted “wealthy white people” for continuing to back Trump.

Earlier in the year, the president ripped Deutsch on Twitter as “a total Loser,” saying Deutsch’s show was “a disaster,” and that Deutsch and CNN’s Erin Burnett “used to BEG me” to appear on “The Apprentice,” when Trump starred on that program.

MSNBC will replace Deutsch’s show with reruns of “All In with Chris Hayes,” according to The Hill.

Fox News emailed MSNBC seeking comment on the schedule change."
New Biden gaffe raises question of truth in Trump's post-fact era,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/30/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-truth-2020-campaign/index.html,"(CNN) If the day ends in a ""y"" it's a good bet that Joe Biden has stumbled into yet another campaign trail gaffe.

The error-prone Democratic front-runner is now caught in a fresh self-inflicted storm over a poignant story he told about an Afghan war hero t hat seems a mishmash of three separate tales.

This after he assured a rapt crowd in New Hampshire last Friday about a story later fact-checked by The Washington Post: ""This is the God's truth. My word as a Biden.""

His string of recent faux pas is occurring in an utterly chaotic political environment because of President Donald Trump.

Biden's misspeaks, misrememberings and other gaffes are not the same as Trump's purposeful daily assaults on the truth.

But they are triggering a debate about the nature of truth in politics and about how voters should distinguish between Biden's slips and the President's arguably more serious habit of bending facts at a historic rate.

The cavalcade of lies uttered by the President has blown to smithereens the traditional metrics of assessing a candidate's fealty to the truth and the consequences of such malfeasance. Yet the exposure of the President's habitual lying has not disqualified him politically. To the contrary, he often prospers by creating his own reality into which loyalists can buy.

As a result of this new era of shredded fact, the 2020 campaign is unfolding at a historic inflection point.

Every word candidates utter is being parsed for falsehoods like never before by armies of media fact checkers conscripted to meet the challenges posed by Trump.

Yet it's also a moment when truth in politics appears more devalued than ever, since the President stands as an example that lying need not be fatal to a political career.

In a surreal moment on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" on Wednesday night, Trump's reelection campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany insisted Trump had never lied to the American people.

The President's behavior has led many media commentators to argue that politics has entered a post-truth era -- where there is no real penalty for lying.

It's hardly news that the former vice president is gaffe-prone: His blooper reel would probably stretch from his beloved Delaware to first-in-the-nation Iowa.

And many Democrats argue that fixating on Biden's verbal slips is a dereliction of duty by Beltway pundits when Trump seems to be tearing at the national fabric.

In fact, Biden made the case himself last December.

""I am a gaffe machine, but my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth,"" he said in Montana. ""I'm ready to litigate all those things. The question is what kind of nation are we becoming? What are we going to do? Who are we?""

Is Trump unique, or is politics in a post-truth era?

One of the most important tests of the 2020 campaign will be whether Trump is unique and an outlier. Or has he pioneered a style of leadership that is not just unmoored from provable fact but can be emulated by other politicians and has lowered the bar on truth in public life?

Given these new dynamics, how then should Biden's scattered falsehoods, exaggerations and conflations be judged?

And should they undermine the central rationale of his campaign -- that he is best placed to beat Trump?

Biden is an especially interesting test case. As a Democratic rising star, the then-senator folded his bid for the 1988 presidential nomination over a plagiarism scandal.

He reluctantly quit after it emerged that he had lifted passages by former British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock for a speech and was accused of other using other uncredited material.

""I am no less frustrated for the environment of presidential politics that makes it so difficult to let the American people measure the whole Joe Biden and not just misstatements I have made,"" he said at the time.

It's a measure of how the standards governing presidential politics have changed that Biden's offense may not have seemed so grave in the current era, nor the penalty so final.

Some Democrats have argued that Biden's gaffes are so quintessential that they are baked into his political image.

It's all part of the Irish blarney of a man whose heart always seems in the right place even if his foot is perpetually headed for his mouth. This is a guy, after all, who has mourned people who are still alive, told a man in a wheelchair to "" Stand up, Chuck"" and once called his old boss ""Barack America.""

Yet there's also a clear double standard.

Hillary Clinton was ridiculed by the Obama campaign in the 2008 Democratic race over her exaggerated claims of landing under sniper fire during the Bosnian war.

In Clinton's case, the falsehood reinforced existing claims that she had a habitual problem with the truth.

The Post reported that Biden got ""the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony"" in the story about the Afghan veteran.

If Biden's story is not treated the same way, there will be more than a whiff of sexism.

Biden's tale also recalled an endearing yarn told by ex-President Ronald Reagan about a World War II aviator who stayed with a comrade who was too wounded to bail out of the crashing plane that took them to their deaths. Like Biden, Reagan was lauding the heroism of others. Still, it later emerged that he'd lifted the story from a movie, not a real life.

Biden insisted on Thursday that there was no reason for the fuss.

""I was making the point how courageous these people are, how incredible they are, this generation of warriors, these fallen angels we've lost,"" he told the Post in an interview.

""I don't know what the problem is. What is it that I said wrong?""

A distraction for Biden

Any day, however, that the story of the Biden campaign concerns gaffes is a bad day for his candidacy.

The vice president is presenting himself as the most experienced and street-smart Democrat who can best be trusted to handle the negative barrage that Trump is waiting to unleash.

But self-imposed controversies undermine that argument and offer an opening to question Biden's attitude toward the truth -- which Trump is sure to take with a outpouring of chutzpah.

The President has already raised questions about the 76-year-old Biden's age, calling him ""sleepy"" and speculating about his mental state -- despite the fact that Trump is also in his 70s.

Democrats are sure to accuse the media covering Biden's gaffes of false equivalency, much as they claimed that the focus in 2016 on Clinton's emails ignored much worse behavior by Trump.

There is also an undeniable question of degree. Is a messed-up Biden war story really in the same league as Trump's false claim that he won the popular vote in the 2016 election?

The latest Biden flap also unfolded after CNN, citing top Trump aides, reported that the President lied about getting phone calls from China about the trade war at the G7 summit.

Not telling the truth about a critical affair of state that affects the world economy surely outweighs the clumsy conflation in a campaign trail story.

Nuance and proportion, however, are always swamped in the heat of a presidential election campaign."
"Protesters in NYC rip ICE, Trump's immigration policies; counter-protesters say Dems to blame for border crisis",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-city-grand-central-trump-immigration-ice-border-2020-protest-impeach,"Hundreds of protesters gathered in New York City’s Grand Central Terminal on Thursday night to protest the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

Meanwhile, counter-protestors slammed Democrats, citing what they viewed as the party's inaction on the nation's border crisis and demanding that personnel from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) be respected.

The hour-long event was organized by Rise and Resist NYC, the local arm of a nonprofit formed in response to President Trump’s election in 2016. It was described on its Facebook page as a silent protest to “object to Border Patrol and ICE terrorizing immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.”

NEARLY 100 PROTESTERS ARRESTED AFTER PART OF NEW YORK FREEWAY SHUT DOWN IN ANTI-ICE DEMONSTRATION

Alexis Danzig, a member of Rise and Resist, told Fox News she helped organize Thursday’s protest to take a stand against “the Trump administration’s disastrous policies at our border.” When asked who she would support in the upcoming 2020 presidential election, Danzig told Fox News she’d vote for “anybody but Trump.”



She also opposed the “locking up people who have come legally to apply for asylum and putting children and families separately into concentration camps with no means to reconnect them.” (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., received backlash in June for comparing U.S.-run detention camps along the U.S.-Mexico border to Nazi-era concentration camps.)

A smaller group of counter-protesters, some carrying ""Trump 2020"" banners and ""Keep America Great"" posters, stood nearby.

A Trump supporter who identified herself only as Jennifer said ICE personnel and law enforcement in New York City were not getting the respect they deserve. She also blamed House Democrats for withholding funds intended to address border issues. (On July 1, President Trump actually signed into law a $4.6 billion spending bill for the border after the plan won approval from both the GOP-led Senate and Democratic-led House.)

""The Democrats had the White House and Congress [under former President Obama] and they did absolutely nothing,” to to address the border crisis, she said.

She said ICE agents are “very hard-working people. A lot of them are Hispanic themselves. They want to keep our country safe. They want sex slavery to end. They want the drug trade to be slowed down. ... They deserve respect just like our police force deserve respect that they haven’t been getting in this city.”



Grand Central Terminal is visited by about 750,000 people daily and is a popular venue for protests. According to the event’s Facebook page, nearly 300 people participated in Thursday's demonstration. Police and other law enforcement officers were on hand. No arrests were reported."
"James Mattis says he had ""no choice"" but to leave Trump administration",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-mattis-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-leave-trump-administration/,"Former Defense Secretary James Mattis said he had ""no choice"" but to leave his job leading the nation's military following President Trump's controversial comments about some the United States' oldest and closest allies.

""I had no choice but to leave,"" Mattis told The Atlantic in a wide-ranging interview. ""I want people to understand why I couldn't stay. I've been informed by four decades of experience, and I just couldn't connect the dots anymore.""

He went on, ""Let me put it this way. I've written an entire book built on the principles of respecting your troops, respecting each other, respecting your allies. Isn't it pretty obvious how I would feel about something like that?""

Mattis quit as defense secretary after Mr. Trump ignored his advice and ordered U.S. troops out of Syria. In his resignation letter, Mattis referred to his strongly held ""views on treating allies with respect,"" an apparent reference to Mr. Trump's complaints about the value of bedrock alliances like NATO.

""One core belief that I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,"" Mattis wrote. He also warned against closeness with countries such as Russia and China.

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" he added.

Angered by the blunt letter, the president moved to push Mattis out earlier than he had planned to leave.

Mattis, however, kept to his military-bred stoicism, refraining from launching an all-out attack on Mr. Trump in one of his first interviews since leaving the Pentagon.

""You don't endanger the country by attacking the elected commander in chief. I may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit, but our system puts the commander in chief there, and to further weaken him when we're up against real threats — I mean, we could be at war on the Korean Peninsula, every time they start launching something,"" Mattis said.

North Korea remains a concern for the former military chief. Mattis found the president's nonchalant approach to dictator Kim Jong Un and Mr. Trump's persistent downplaying of North Korea's nuclear capabilities particularly troubling.

""Any Marine general or any other senior servant of the people of the United States would find that, to use a mild euphemism, counterproductive and beneath the dignity of the presidency,"" Mattis said.

But Mattis contends that the current political environment is not because of Mr. Trump alone. Instead, he blames outside forces that elected him to office.

""We've got to address the things that put him there in the first place,"" Mattis said."
Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."
Ukraine's New Parliament Approves Top Cabinet Officials,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-29/ukraines-new-parliament-approves-top-cabinet-officials,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to newly elected Ukrainian parliament deputies during parliament session in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019. Parliament in Ukraine has opened for its first session since an election last month. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) The Associated Press

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday urged lawmakers to help liberalize the economy and pursue integration into Europe as the newly-elected parliament swiftly approved his appointees for top government jobs.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian elected president in April, told parliament that the public expects lawmakers to help return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and settle the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Facing a hostile parliament after his landslide victory, Zelenskiy called a snap parliamentary election in July that gave his Servant of the People party the parliament majority. The party takes its name from the popular television sitcom in which Zelenskiy played a high school teacher propelled into the presidency.

Like Zelenskiy, a newcomer in politics, none of the Servant of the People lawmakers have previous experience in parliament. Many Ukrainians, who have grown tired of the old elites they see as corrupt and inefficient, see it as an advantage.

The Verkhovna Rada on Thursday quickly named Oleksiy Honcharuk, 35, as the nation's new prime minister. In his speech in parliament, Honcharuk pledged to focus on encouraging economic growth, raising living standards and combating corruption.

""No one will be allowed to steal in the new government,"" he said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy a star. Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think tank. ""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

Sidenko noted that Honcharuk will face a tough task of introducing unpopular measures that Ukraine's Western investors expect the government to take to shore up the economy.

""The new prime minister will have to do dirty and unpopular work, reducing state subsidies and social assistance as required by the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders,"" Sidenko said.

The lawmakers also quickly approved other Zelenskiy's appointees for top jobs.

Ivan Bakanov, who directed Zelenskiy's campaign, was named the chief of Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU.

Dmytro Razumkov, who served as Zelenskiy's campaign adviser and later became the leader of his party, was elected parliamentary speaker.

The Rada also approved the new foreign minister, Vadim Pristaiko, who previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and later its envoy to NATO.

Speaking to lawmakers, Pristaiko pledged to push for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.

""We need peace and stability,"" he said.

Andriy Zahorodniuk, who was named defense minister, pledged to streamline the military and free it of graft.

""Everyone knows that they steal in the army,"" he said. ""People have grown tired of those problems.""

Two of the members of former President Petro Poroshenko's Cabinet kep their jobs — Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Finance Minister Oksana Markarova.

Markarova is a technocrat, while Avakov helped Zelenskiy win by speaking out about Poroshenko's alleged attempts to buy voters' support before the election.

Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta Center think tank said Zelenskiy wants the new Cabinet to speed up liberal economic reforms, but is aware of the challenges.

""President Zelenskiy wants the new parliament and the new Cabinet to serve as instruments to achieve quick reforms,"" Fesenko said. ""The new Cabinet will inevitably face a dilemma of how to conduct swift reforms without a further plunge in the already low living standards that could provoke a social explosion."""
Myanmar's KBZ Bank hires legal powerhouse Williams & Connolly after holding company was implicated in UN report,https://www.cnbc.com,['Brian Schwartz'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/myanmar-kbz-bank-hires-williams-connolly-for-potential-legal-trouble.html,"One of the most lucrative private banks in Myanmar has hired a legal powerhouse after its holding company was implicated in a scathing United Nations report that blasted the country's military.

Kanbawza Bank has tapped Williams & Connolly, a U.S.-based law firm, to be the company's legal representatives in case U.S. sanctions arise from the U.N.'s fact finding mission. The report accuses Myanmar's military of having ties to a litany of businesses and that those dealings have led to extensive human rights abuses. The U.N. called for a criminal investigation into KBZ Bank's parent company, KBZ Group, for allegedly funding a border fence that has prevented Rohingya Muslims from returning to Myanmar after fleeing the country in 2017.

The firm sent a letter to the bank's CEO, Michael DeNoma, earlier this month and it describes the agreement between the two parties, including a $250,000 retainer.

""Williams & Connolly LLP will provide legal services to you in connection with potential US legal issues and sanctions matters which may arise out of an August 5, 2019 UN Human Rights Council Report on Myanmar,"" David Aufhauser, a partner in the firm, wrote. Aufhauser was previously a managing director and global general counsel at investment bank UBS.

The bank's new hire was discovered after CNBC reviewed foreign lobbying registration forms, with one of the documents describing other responsibilities that may involve having to reach out to members of President Donald Trump's administration, congressional lawmakers and the U.N. itself.

""Additional services will potentially include providing advice regarding legal consequences of the report, providing advice on lobbying and public relations issues related to the representation, lobbying U.S. government officials in the Executive Branch, Congress,and/or the United Nations, and discussing the matter with U.S. or international media organizations,"" the exhibit reads.

The U.N., Aufhauser and KBZ Bank did not return requests for comment.

The effort by KBZ Bank to retain a marquee legal team suggests there are internals fears of severe backlash after the U.N. report, especially from foreign governments such as the U.S. The bank itself has always been held in a high regard around the world.

The Milken Institute, a economic think tank based out of California, described KBZ Bank in a 2017 study as a firm that dominates the Myanmar market.

""Among the privately owned banks, the so-called 'Big Three' dominate the market,"" the study says. ""Combined, Kanbawza Bank (KBZ), Ayeyarwady Bank (AYA), and Co-operative Bank (CB) control about two-thirds of all loans, two-thirds of all deposits, and more than 50 percent of all bank branches in the country.""

Ukraine's new president, 41-year-old Volodymyr Zelensky, himself a political novice and a popular comedian before winning April's election, nominated Honcharuk on Thursday after weeks of consultations.

Honcharuk's candidacy was quickly approved by MPs as Zelensky's new ""Servant of the People"" party holds a majority after parliamentary polls last month.

He replaces Volodymyr Groysman, 41, who offered his resignation after Zelensky's inauguration.

The young lawyer is little known to the public and has given few interviews. A source in the president's office told the AFP news agency he prefers to ""quietly do his job"".

The appointment is in line with Zelensky's pledge to bring in fresh faces and shake up Ukraine's stagnant politics.

Honcharuk, who studied law and public administration before cofounding a law firm at the age of 24, is considered a supporter of liberal economic reforms. Some have described him as a ""team player"" and ""workaholic"".

Before becoming deputy head of the president's office when Zelensky came to power, he managed for several years an EU-funded NGO that works to improve the business environment in Ukraine.

Zelensky's election win took place against a backdrop of war that has killed more than 13,000 people in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, with government forces fighting Russia-backed separatists. The conflict followed Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 which in turn came after Ukraine overthrew Moscow-backed leader Viktor Yanukovich earlier that year.

'Technical figure'

Analysts say it is unlikely Honcharuk will be able to steer government policy and will remain largely in the shadow of the presidency.

""Honcharuk cannot be an independent prime minister, even if he wanted to,"" analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the AFP.

A high-ranking source who has previously worked with Honcharuk described the experience as ""moderately positive"".

The source said Honcharuk had a ""well-structured"" vision and is adept ""at setting priorities that can achieve results"".

But in government the best he can hope to do is play a ""positive technical role"" with the support of the president's office, the source said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelensky a star.

Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelensky's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think-tank.

""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

'Eastern European tiger'

In rare interviews, Honcharuk has pleaded for continued cooperation with the IMF, calling it ""crucial"" for Ukraine.

The country is looking to work with the IMF for the next three to four years, he told Novoe Vremya magazine, with hopes this would help Ukraine become ""an Eastern European tiger"".

Honcharuk also supports revoking a ban on the sale of fertile agricultural land - a decision much awaited by Western investors and creditors, but to which the vast majority of Ukrainians are opposed.

Oleksandr Parashchiy, head of analytics at investment bank Concorde Capital, said the main challenge for the new government is ""not to disappoint people's expectations, which will be difficult"".

""The main thing that is expected is economic reforms and the fight against corruption,"" Parashchiy said.

Honcharuk himself seemed upbeat about the country's outlook.

""Soon positive changes will accelerate significantly,"" he wrote on his Facebook page after meeting World Bank President David Malpass in Ukraine last week.

""Everything will be fine,"" he captioned a picture. ""Stay tuned!"""
US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."

Nigeria has backed down and lowered visa fees for Americans after a US visa hike,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1698117/nigeria-reduces-visa-fee-for-americans-in-response-to-trump/,"It’s taken just a day for the Nigerian government to respond to the Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown measure on Nigerians.

It has reduced visa fees for Americans traveling to Nigeria from $180 to $150 in response to the US embassy’s introduction of a “reciprocity fee” for Nigerians. The US embassy claims the new reciprocity fee, ranging from $80 to $303 and only to be paid for approved visas, has been introduced to “eliminate that cost difference” between visa application fees for both countries.

The move was in line with a Trump executive order in 2017 for the US secretary of State to, among other things, adjust fee schedules “to match the treatment of United States nationals” by other countries. The US embassy claimed it has been in talks with Nigerian authorities for 18 months to align visa fees.

For its part, Nigeria’s government says the decision to lower visa fees for American applicants was taken months ago but was not implemented given the transition in government. (Nigeria’s president Buhari only inaugurated a new cabinet last week after winning reelection for a second term in February).

It’s unclear if the new visa fee reduction for American applicants to Nigeria will also see the US Embassy revise its reciprocity fee structure for Nigerians.

Some international business people and tourists from countries including the United States have long complained about the high expense of Nigerian visas and the difficulty of obtaining them. The Buhari government has targeted improving this with programs including visa-on-arrival for business people and potential investors. Yet, Nigerians also face challenges with the US visa application process, which is renown for its intensive paperwork (even for short stay visas) and involves daunting consular interview sessions that often end in vague reasons for application rejections.

The quick reaction from Nigerian authorities is a change of tack from earlier measures by the Trump administration to clamp on Nigerian visa applications. In May, the US suspended a visa waiver program for Nigerian applicants and has reportedly considered issuing visas for shorter validity periods in response to the high rates of Nigerian nationals overstaying visas.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Read more: How This Bull Market Will End

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

Donald Trump Jr. Campaigns for Dr. Greg Murphy,https://www.witn.com,[],,,,https://www.witn.com/content/news/Donald-Trump-Jr-Campaigns-for-Dr-Greg-Murphy-558631081.html,"Donald Trump Jr. was in New Bern Monday night to campaign for 3rd District Congressional candidate Republican Dr. Greg Murphy.

Trump Jr. said, ""We win this seat, we use it, we keep going forward and win North Carolina in 2020, we're gonna win the presidency.""

Trump Jr. was sounding confident as he spoke to the crowd of supporters gathered at the private campaign event for Murphy.

Murphy says, ""It's great to have the executive branch supporting those of us who are going to be in the legislative branch.""

The campaign stop is one of two Trump Jr. and conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle made in North Carolina Wednesday, both for congressional candidates. The first stop was in Charlotte.

Guilfoyle says, ""We want to make sure that we have winners that are going to support the president and stand shoulder to shoulder with the president.""

The visit to eastern Carolina comes less than two weeks before election day for the 3rd Congressional District seat.

Voters are choosing between Murphy, Democrat Allen Thomas and two third party candidates, to replace the late Congressman, Republican Walter Jones.

Murphy says, ""You know, It's a low turnout, that's what a special election is, but I think folks have really responded to our message.""

Trump Jr. is urging voters to head to the polls and get their friends to do the same, as early voting continues for another week. He says, ""Make sure you turn up. When you do, we win and winning is so much better than losing, right?""

Those who aren't registered to vote in this special election can still do so if you vote early. You will have to bring an ID and a bill with your name and address on in to register. Early voting will continue until September 6th when polls close at 7:00 p.m.

Election day is September 10th.

U.S. weekly jobless claims increase slightly,https://kfgo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/29/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-slightly/932105/,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.

Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.

But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.

According to economists at JPMorgan, this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.

Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.

For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%.

David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."

"Nigeria's Buhari Assigns Cabinet Portfolios, Appoints New Oil Minister",https://www.usnews.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-21/nigerias-buhari-assigns-cabinet-portfolios-appoints-timipre-silva-oil-minister,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari poses with his new cabinet for a photo, after a swearing-in ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria, August 21, 2019. Nigeria Presidency/Handout via REUTERS Reuters

By Felix Onuah

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa's top producer of crude oil.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country's main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa's biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria's emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

""The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,"" Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country's ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

""We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February's election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party's base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

""There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,"" said Liewerscheidt.

Then and now: what senior Tories say about proroguing parliament,https://www.theguardian.com,"['Simon Murphy', 'Larry Elliott']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/then-and-now-what-senior-tories-say-about-proroguing-parliament,"A few weeks ago they were dead-set against, but now their positions are a lot less clear

Then and now: what senior Tories say about proroguing parliament

“Absolutely outrageous.” “Not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century.” “A mad suggestion.”

The idea of suspending parliament to force through Brexit provoked unequivocal condemnation from senior Conservatives just weeks ago, with ministers falling over themselves to express their horror.

Now, after Boris Johnson moved to prorogue the Commons for five weeks ahead of the UK’s EU departure date of 31 October, his ministers’ once-steely opposition has turned to a more tight-lipped approach.

The Guardian hotfooted it to Whitehall in an attempt to get answers from ministers on their apparent U-turns, which follow on from strongly worded statements earlier in the summer.

Nicky Morgan

Proroguing parliament is clearly a mad suggestion” – 6 June

I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister” – Thursday

The newly appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Nicky Morgan, told the BBC’s Question Time programme in June that proroguing parliament was “clearly a mad suggestion”.

“You cannot say you are going to take back control … and then go: ‘Oh, by the way, we are just going to shut parliament down for a couple of months, so we are just going to drift out on a no deal,’” she said.

But on Thursday morning, when the Guardian spotted Morgan strolling past the gates of Downing Street, it was a different story. Asked to clarify her position on proroguing parliament given her previous opposition, she said: “I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister.”

Pressed again on whether she still harboured doubts about the plan as the Guardian struggled to keep pace with her along Parliament Street, she repeated firmly: “I support the prime minister.”

When asked to respond to critics’ suggestion that proroguing parliament represented an affront to democracy, she said nothing and walked away.

Matt Hancock

Prorogation would mean the end of the Conservative party” – 6 June

Morning, how are you? Sorry. How are you?” – Thursday

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was once a vigorous opponent of the concept of prorogation, so much so that he wrote a letter during the Tory leadership campaign pledging to rule out the option and urging other candidates to do the same. “To suspend parliament explicitly to pursue a course of action against its wishes is not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century,” he wrote.

The letter, dated 6 June, added: “A policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.”

Giving a speech during the campaign four days later, Hancock referenced war veterans saying that proroguing parliament would go against “everything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for”. He added: “And I will not have it.”

Now, apparently, he will. Asked by the Guardian to clarify whether his position had changed, his spokesman failed to comment. Caught by reporters earlier in the day outside his house, he dodged their questions and hurried to his car. “Morning, how are you?” he replied. “Sorry. How are you?”

Michael Gove

Michael Gove

It would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy” – 9 June

Parliamentarians will have plenty of time to debate Brexit” – Wednesday

Leave-supporting Michael Gove has also spoken out against suspending parliament. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in early June: “Proroguing parliament in order to try and get no deal through, I think would be wrong.”

Gove, appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by Johnson last month, added: “I think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy.”

The Guardian found a gaggle of remain protesters gathered outside the Cabinet Office at lunchtime, where Michael Gove was meeting union leaders from Unite and GMB to discuss their concerns about the “catastrophic” impact of a no-deal Brexit on Britain’s manufacturing industry.

He did not do much to allay their fears, it seems. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB Union’s manufacturing section, labelled the government’s approach “lastminute.com”.

Unite’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, condemned proroguing parliament, calling it an outrage and a silencing mechanism.

Asked to clarify his position, Gove’s spokesman pointed the Guardian to an interview he conducted with the BBC on Wednesday. Pressed on whether proroguing parliament was a political attempt to stop debate on Brexit and block MPs from preventing the country leaving the EU without a deal, Gove replied: “It’s certainly not. The prime minister is clear that he wants to use a new parliamentary session in order to ensure that the people’s priorities are met. It’s also the case that parliamentarians will have plenty of time when we come back next week to debate Brexit.”

Amber Rudd

Amber Rudd

Nobody should consider involving the Queen” – 16 June

I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department” – Thursday



The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, described suspending of parliament as “absolutely outrageous” in June. “To consider closing parliament is the most extraordinary idea I’ve ever heard,” she said. “It is a ridiculous suggestion. For a start it would involve approaching the Queen ... nobody should consider doing that.”

Did she still think approaching the Queen would be an outrage when Jacob Rees-Mogg went to see her on Wednesday? Such questions did not seem to please her during a visit to Belfast. Still, at least she retained a laser-like focus on her day job.

Asked about proroguing parliament, she replied: “I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department, how people are helping people into work. And what I’ve seen today has been really reassuring.” Asked again about the suspension of parliament as she got into a waiting car, she said: “I’m going to continue doing my job as secretary of state for work and pensions.” Her spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

Sajid Javid

Sajid Javid

You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy” – 16 June

No comment” – Thursday

The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was also staunchly opposed to shutting down parliament during the Tory leadership campaign. “You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy ... we are not selecting a dictator of our country,” he said. As the Guardian surveilled the Treasury, Javid was nowhere to be seen to explain his position. Nor did his spokeswoman answer its questions. he also seemed to be absent from the airwaves.

On the proroguing of parliament, a government spokesperson said: “We are currently in the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years and it’s crucial that we put a bold and ambitious domestic programme to MPs so that we can deliver on people’s priorities across the country. To do this we need a Queen’s speech. This is about providing parliament with a new legislative programme that will help the NHS, fight crime, invest in infrastructure and cut the cost of living.

“As we have said previously, prorogation to suspend parliament, to block MPs further consideration of Brexit is not something we support. MPs will sit next week, the week after, the week before EU council, and two weeks after. Not only that, but the government will put its entire domestic agenda, and inevitably its approach to Brexit, to the vote as part of the Queen’s speech, with major votes on 21 and 22 October.”

Back outside the Cabinet Office, Brimble was furious about ministers’ change of tack. “They’re playing politics with people’s lives, they’re playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” she said. “They’re playing politics with the future of this country to appease the Brexiters in the Tory party.”"
Official: Kentucky Cabinet fails to secure coal worker bonds | Tacoma News Tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com,['The Associated Press'],,,,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article234520787.html,"The state's Labor Cabinet hasn't secured the necessary bonds from coal companies that would cover wage payments to miners if their employer unexpectedly shuts down, Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear said.

Beshear, a Democrat running for governor, announced on Thursday that his office examined records of Kentucky companies that should be required to pay the bonds. State law requires construction and mineral companies in business for less than five years to pay performance bonds that would cover four weeks of employee pay. Beshear says 1,000 miners are working for coal companies that haven't paid the bond.

Some Kentucky miners were left with bounced paychecks after one coal company, Milton, West Virginia-based Blackjewel, filed for bankruptcy on July 1. Some of those miners are protesting the lack of payments by blocking a coal shipment sitting on railroad tracks in Harlan County.

A Labor Cabinet spokeswoman said the ""full force"" of the Cabinet has been directed toward recovering wages for the Blackjewel miners.

""It's curious that the Attorney General is just now weighing in with his after-the-fact advice,"" Mary Elizabeth Robertson said in a statement. Robertson said the attorney general's office should have worked on adding reporting requirements to the state law to give the Cabinet ""the tools it needed to identify non-compliance and enforce the requirement.""

Beshear said he is concerned that the Labor Cabinet acted intentionally to ignore the law. He pointed out that Labor Cabinet officials were in support of a bill before the General Assembly last year that would have done away with the bond requirement.

""And that intentional decision to ignore the law has created the situation these Blackjewel miners are in, and that others could fall into,"" he said.

A report released Thursday by the attorney general's office said at least 30 mining companies may not have paid the bond, as required by the law passed in 2010. The law says ""any employee whose wages are secured by a bond may obtain payment of those wages, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees.""

Gov. Matt Bevin announced in July that the Labor Cabinet would investigate the lost wages of the Blackjewel miners. The Cabinet said the company sent bounced checks to its workers."
Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."
"A Tory minister has been caught telling the truth? Don’t panic, it was only an accident",https://www.independent.co.uk,['Tom Peck'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/ben-wallace-boris-johnson-brexit-prorogation-dominic-cummings-coup-a9084321.html,"Ben Wallace was the longest-serving security minister in this country’s history. For three years he led this nation’s fight against terror in all its ever-changing technological forms.

So it is a little concerning that in that time nobody got round to briefing him on what it is that a television camera and a lapel microphone actually do.

Indeed he has every right to feel let down by the department, the Ministry of Defence, to be exact, that he now runs.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Someone, really, should have let him know, that if you have consented to the wearing of a microphone, and are standing in the full glare of a television news camera, it is not, perhaps the most auspicious time for some light-hearted small talk that will fatally undermine your own government’s 48-hour media lying strategy.

Only the day before, there had been Boris Johnson, grinning his way through claims that he was absolutely, definitely, only proroguing parliament to get on with his minority government’s “new, exciting legislative agenda”, absolutely none of which can possibly pass through the House of Commons.

And then, on Thursday morning, there was Jacob Rees-Mogg on the Today programme, still unable to get his fob watch back in his pocket after his trip to Balmoral to see the Queen, claiming that the longest suspension of parliament since 1945 was in fact “routine” and “quite boring”.

So what was Ben Wallace doing, the fifth most senior minister in the cabinet, at a meeting in Helsinki, telling his French counterpart that, in fact, this whole prorogation thing really was all about Brexit?

“Parliament has been very good at saying what it doesn’t want but it has been awful at saying what it wants. That’s the reality,” he told her, over a polite chuckle.

“So you know any leader has to, you know, try. I don’t know what the outcome of it will be. Oh... politics.”

Oh, politics indeed... lol. Politics, which in the UK has come to mean little more than the industrialisation of lying. Just what will the outcome be? Who knows? Ben Wallace certainly doesn’t.

Indeed, how did Mr Wallace not come by the memo? Which is to say, if you’re a Tory cabinet minister, whenever you spot a TV camera, whatever you do, don’t tell the truth.

It’s not like this is a new diktat either. It certainly predates the Boris Johnson era.

The news programmes have not struggled, in the last 24 hours, to dig up all sorts of footage of all kinds of Tories, looking into a television camera and telling all kinds of porkies.

There’s one of Matt Hancock, from just a few months ago, saying prorogation of parliament would be an affront to the men who died at Dunkirk, and, he adds, with staccato certainty, “I. Will. Not. Have. It.”

Except, it turns out, he will have it. Because he’s not resigned, he’s still in the cabinet, and parliament’s very much still being prorogued.

There’s Amber Rudd, sitting on Hastings pier, saying it would be “outrageous to consider proroguing parliament. We are not Stuart kings”. And yet, she’s only gone and done it.

There’s Sajid Javid, at the Tory leadership hustings, saying, “You don’t deliver democracy by trashing democracy.” He’s the chancellor of the exchequer now and somehow, by way of a miracle really, it has become trashed.

There’s Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Nicky Morgan. Anyway, I could go on for some time but we’ll limit it to just one more, kind of crucial one.

Dominic Cummings, the Brexit brain egg, the man whose great genius is the altar on which the reputation of the country must be laid. The Oracle. The post-politics politician. The guy who is, let’s face it, too clever for democracy.

The great visionary who has emerged from his long years buried in Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War only to find he has slipped the surly bonds of Other People’s Opinions, not to say, the British parliamentary system.

It’s just that I could have sworn I saw him wandering out of his house three weeks ago, Vote Leave tote bag over his shoulder, reactolite lenses blackening under the glare from his own soul, stopping to tell Sky News that, “Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect. That’s the critical issue.”

And indeed it is the critical issue. It is the uncertain foundation of our way of life. And yet, this country had a general election in 2017. It was fully informed by the EU referendum that had occurred a year before it. Theresa May went around the country, telling the voters with terrifying singularity to “strengthen my hand in the negotiations with Brussels”.

And the voters declined to do it. They returned a hung parliament, one that will not sanction a no-deal Brexit, so Cummings and Johnson have had a think. They’ve decided they know best and chucked it out.

But at least we can know that Cummings got the memo.

“Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect. That is the critical issue.”

It’s not as grand a lie as the rest. It may even have been a mere oversight, which we are only too glad to correct. Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect, apart from me."

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

[Trump retaliates in trade war by demanding companies cut ties with China ]

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

[‘Protectionist bullying’: China denounces Trump administration’s latest tariff hikes ]

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

Et Aug.']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/08/30/donald-trump-makes-me-doubt-founders-checks-and-balances-column/2132691001/,"I now hesitate to defend the 'genius' of the Framers. I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances they said would keep us on track.

The day after Labor Day, I will stand behind a lectern in a lecture hall on the campus of Rutgers University and teach a course that I have taught for 40 years. I have always approached the first day eager to teach about the establishment of our republic and how government works today. In the past three years, the eagerness has curdled into apprehension as I debate with myself how even-handed I should be in dealing with a national government that I can no longer recognize, much less approve of.

It would be pointless for me and boring for the students to spend the semester assailing President Donald Trump for casting public service as contemptible with his unjustified disparagement of everyone from scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His contaminating influence has even spread beyond the executive branch to transform the United States Senate, an institution that I have long revered, into a pitiable amen corner that either assents to his most outrageous statements or passively cringes in silence.

Whom did they learn that from?: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.

I am now hesitant defending what I used to refer to as the “genius” of the framers of the Constitution because I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances that James Madison assured us were “auxiliary precautions” to prevent our government from going off the rails at times when the wisdom of the American people is faulty. The faultiness of that wisdom is, in my mind, on vivid display by the man they chose to lead the nation.

Serious flaws in the political system

It is hard for me now, in discussing the voting behavior of Americans, to grasp what kind of desperation prompted so many of my fellow citizens to choose and now enthusiastically support a man who has degraded the office of the presidency. How can American citizens in whom sovereignty resides have acted so irresponsibly? I will grant, however, that the alternative was not a good one. But that also speaks to serious flaws in the system.

I have searched for historical examples to reassure the students, and myself, that we have sometimes made poor choices in the men we have elected president, but that the damage that they inflicted on the country was slight and things turned out all right. I find it harder these days to use these historical examples, because they were part of a different time in which partisan strife was not so intractable and there were individuals who enjoyed universal respect to whom we could turn to help right the ship. Recently, people looked hopefully on the the prospect of William Barr as attorney general — another Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus perhaps — only to see him mutate into a stooge for the president.

More distressing even than lacking good people to restore the nation such as in the aftermath of Watergate and Richard Nixon’s resignation has been the failure of those exiting the Trump administration to speak openly about the mismanagement, capriciousness and venality of the president and his entourage.

Many individuals who spoke privately about Trump’s ignorance and caprice, such as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, slunk silently into retirement without getting on the record their obvious contempt for Trump. Even the vaunted truth-teller Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose departure was attributed to policy differences with the president, has not aired those differences so that the public could be able to evaluate whose version was the more credible.

Pulling my punches on Trump

Few of our past presidents were wholly conversant with constitutional law, but most seemed to be wary of the electrified wires of the system of separation of powers that defined limits they dared not transgress. Attributing to President Trump the most innocent interpretation of his abuses of power, such as the recent order to American companies to leave China, he has been exposed as a constitutional imbecile.

Just for the looks: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too.

More ominously, he is a man with dictatorial tendencies that exceed even of those past presidents most contemptuous of checks and balances. He has elevated the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership to a level above that of the First Amendment’s protection against the abridgment of a free press, and he tampers dangerously with the 14th Amendment’s clear message on birthright citizenship.

Ultimately, I will probably pull my punches because I don’t want to come across as a scold, and I will temper my words because I don’t want to give my students the idea that all is lost. It would be truly be the worst message of all.

German cabinet agrees to end reunification tax for most taxpayers,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-tax/german-cabinet-agrees-to-end-reunification-tax-for-most-taxpayers-idUSKCN1VB0VN,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government agreed on Wednesday to exempt most taxpayers from the solidarity tax that was introduced after the county’s reunification.

Under a draft law drawn up by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, some 90% of taxpayers will from 2021 no longer be subject to the 5.5% levy, which has been added to income tax. The amount payable will be reduced for a further 6.5% of taxpayers.

The tax has been used primarily to support economic development in the poorer eastern states that made up the Communist German Democratic Republic until the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989.

“Today is a significant day on the road to the completion of German unity. The costs of reunification have in large part come to an end,” Scholz said in a statement.

Merkel’s government has incurred no new debt since 2014 thanks to an unusually long growth cycle, record-high employment, robust tax revenues and low interest rates.

However, with fears of recession rising after economic contraction in the second quarter, calls are increasing at home and abroad for the government to provide extra fiscal stimulus.

Only top earners will still have to pay the tax in full. Scholz has said the government will look at that in the future, but he made clear in an interview with ARD television that now was not the time for the richest to get a tax break.

In their 2018 coalition deal, Merkel’s conservatives and Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to cut the tax burden for middle and lower earners.

Tweaks to the draft law - which has been hotly disputed within the government - are likely as it goes through parliament.

Conservatives, led by Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, want the solidarity tax - originally introduced as a temporary measure to invest in infrastructure in the former GDR but then also used for other purposes - to be totally abolished by 2026.

The finance ministry said the changes will result in around 10 billion euros ($11.1 billion) in tax relief for citizens from 2021, rising to around 12 billion euros by 2024.

Last year, the tax contributed 18.9 billion euros to the federal budget, said the ministry."
Exclusive: Saudi Aramco board sees too many risks for New York IPO - sources,https://wkzo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://wkzo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/30/exclusive-saudi-aramco-board-sees-too-many-risks-for-new-york-ipo-sources/932505/?refer-section=national,"By Rania El Gamal, Alex Lawler, Marwa Rashad and Hadeel Al Sayegh

DUBAI/LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - The board of Saudi Aramco has determined that listing the state energy giant in New York would carry too many legal risks to make it a realistic option, five sources said, although they said a final decision lay with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

New York was the exchange favored by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before plans for the initial public offering were put on hold last year, the sources said, even after Aramco's lawyers and some government advisers had raised legal concerns.

New York offers the largest investor base in the world, vital for an IPO that aims to attract as much as $100 billion, a sum that could prove tough for other exchanges to raise. U.S. President Donald Trump urged the kingdom to list in New York.

One source familiar with the IPO plan told Reuters the board, made up of cabinet ministers and Aramco executives, had concluded at an August meeting that a U.S. listing would not be considered ""unless Aramco is offered sovereign immunity that protects it from any legal action.""

""This is, of course, hard if not impossible to achieve,"" the source added.

Like other sources who spoke to Reuters, he asked not to be named because of sensitivities surrounding the fate of the IPO which the crown prince hopes will value the company at $2 trillion. Some insiders and bankers say that figure is too high.

The move to rule out New York and scale back on the valuation suggests technocrats in Aramco and the government are pushing for a more realistic IPO plan, the sources said.

Alongside New York, exchanges in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo have been keen to woo Saudi officials to secure a deal to trade shares in Aramco, which is expected to have a primary listing in Riyadh.

But Saudi officials say the New York disclosure process and complex regulations might legally interfere with the sovereignty of the Saudi government, which would remain the major Aramco shareholder, probably retaining a 95% stake.

""Listing in New York is no longer an option,"" one industry source familiar with the IPO process said.

Riyadh and London were now the main options, with the domestic listing first to be followed by an international offering at a later stage, four of the sources said.

""The likelihood of a local listing is increasing, with 1-2% of Aramco being listed locally,"" another source familiar with the IPO process said, adding that ""the other possibility is listing in London"".

LITIGATION RISKS

Three sources said potential litigation risks in the United States included U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) and proposed U.S. legislation known as ""NOPEC"", which could lead to Aramco being sued in U.S. courts.

""The whole system is highly litigious, but of course Aramco has lots of investments in the U.S. which will continue,"" said another industry source, who has discussed the IPO process with Saudi officials.

NOPEC legislation would make it illegal for foreign nations to work together to limit fossil fuel supplies and set prices, opening Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to U.S. legal challenges.

JASTA allows lawsuits against the Saudi government as it says it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and should pay compensation. Riyadh denies the charges.

Aramco could also become embroiled in existing lawsuits against oil companies in the United States for their role in climate change, the sources said.

Saudi Aramco said in a statement it ""continues to engage with the shareholder on IPO readiness activities"", when asked by Reuters if New York had been dropped as a listing venue.

""The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholder's choosing,"" it added, without elaborating.

Tadawul, the main Saudi stock exchange, has said it expected inflows of $15 billion to $20 billion this year after its inclusion in the FTSE Russell and MSCI emerging market indices, helping secure liquidity for Aramco's local listing.

The crown prince has favored a New York Stock Exchange listing in part because of Riyadh's longstanding ties with Washington, sources familiar with Saudi thinking have said. Aramco began life in the 1930s as a U.S.-Saudi venture.

Selling a 5% stake in Aramco has been a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. But the IPO, initially slated for 2017, has faced repeated delays.

The IPO is now not expected until Aramco completes its acquisition of a majority stake in petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), pushing it back to 2020 or 2021.

Aramco has already asked major banks to submit proposals for potential roles in the planned IPO, two sources said.

Saudi banks were pitching for various roles in the IPO in late August in the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran, while international banks would be pitching for mandates for the share sale in early September in London, one of the two sources said.

He Is An Emeritus Professor Of Constitutional Law At American University S Washington College Of Law.', 'August At Pm']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/28/whats-trumps-idea-america-first-g-cash-flowing-his-golf-resort/,"

President Trump speaks at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Monday. (Markus Schreiber/AP)

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. He is an emeritus professor of constitutional law at American University’s Washington College of Law.

President Trump thinks he has found the perfect site for the 2020 Group of Seven summit: the Trump National Doral golf resort. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it,” he said from this year’s G-7 gathering in France.

His choice wasn’t exactly astonishing, considering that since he took office, Trump has visited his business properties at taxpayer expense 362 times; there have been 630 visits to Trump properties by at least 250 Trump administration officials, including White House staff members, Cabinet members and agency employees; and visits to Trump properties have been made by 111 officials representing 65 foreign governments, all according to a report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

[Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.]

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

[Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.]

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)

Taking their cue from red states that regularly banded together to sue the Obama administration, Democratic attorneys general began challenging the Trump administration in court the first month President Trump took office, starting with the travel ban.

The litigation by coalition has continued unabated, with at least six multistate lawsuits filed against Trump policies in August alone, most prominently against the president’s attempt to deny green cards and visa extensions to foreign nationals seeking public assistance.

Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

Software changes manufacturer's business model,https://www.furnitureproduction.net,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.furnitureproduction.net/news/articles/2019/08/50409524-software-changes-business-model,"An award-winning Irish furniture manufacturer producing quality, bespoke joinery, kitchens and furniture for high end office fitouts, says introducing Cabinet Vision and Alphacam into its company, completely changed its business model.

BSG Design was founded by brothers Barry and Stephen Goulding, at Trim, County Meath, in 2013. Three years later they reached the final of Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur, and in 2017 won the Meath Best Small to Medium Enterprise and Overall Best Business.

Barry attributes their success to attention to detail in their design and planning, and short project timescales. “Using Alphacam and Cabinet Vision has pretty much doubled the size of the business by improving efficiency in the production processes.”

The majority of their work is bespoke high-end office and kitchen fitouts including reception counters, wall panelling and tea stations for prestigious customers such as PayPal, IBM, Ernst & Young, Irish Life, Northern Trust Bank, and Gourmet Food Parlour, with the remainder being domestic kitchens and cabinetry.

Prior to investing in its four-axis SCM Pratix CNC nesting machine, the company operated with a panel saw, but now 70% of their work goes through Cabinet Vision, and 30% through Alphacam, with an overlap of around 20% of jobs being handled by both.

Barry first used the software while studying at the GMIT Letterfrack College in Ireland for his Design and Manufacture qualification and Furniture Design degree. “After graduating, I worked in the industry for around 10 years, for furniture companies, and could see how much more efficient they’d be if they used Cabinet Vision and Alphacam.”

So, when he started his own company, it was always the plan that CNC machinery and the CAD/CAM software would be introduced. He now carries out CAD drawings and 3D renders in Cabinet Vision, and uses its powerful Screen to Machine tool to communicate all the engineering data directly to the Pratix.

A number of bespoke programs to manage aspects such as Keku clips and locks have been set up via the software’s User Created Standards (USCs). “These bespoke USCs write specific code for us to enable the software to do exactly what we need for particular individual tasks.”

And, as BSG manufacture cabinets to suit customer requirements, they use the software to set different construction methods. “For example, we may be working on an inframe unit, and the next job could be a slab door with a chamfer back handle detail and a checkout in the carcass for the handle rail. Or switching between rafix and dowel jointing, as details vary from project to project. So it’s invaluable to be able to vary the construction methods on how each item is made, quickly and simply.”

Barry describes how BSG originally used 2D software for its panel saw, and that ‘huge’ time savings have now been achieved by drawing a 3D model in Cabinet Vision, as all the toolpaths for the CNC are generated automatically.

“Screen to Machine sends accurate NC code for everything we’ve put on the model, out to the machine tool. For example, if we put drawers or any cabinet fittings on the model, all the mounting holes are machined in the various positions correctly, without us having to do anything else.”

Barry says with Cabinet Vision taking care of standard shaped cabinets, it was a natural progression for the company to bring in Alphacam to tackle more complex components such as curved reception counters, and other items that could not be cut with Cabinet Vision.

The two software brands from the Production Software stable of Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence have played a major contribution in overcoming BSG’s biggest challenge, which was meeting the extremely short deadlines required from customers.

“Basically, once the CAD drawings are done and approved, we’re almost there, because getting the CNC program, the saw cutlist, assembly sheets and labels with manufacturing information from the 3D model is very fast.”

While they tender to main contractors, they are often recommended by architects and interior designers, who are impressed with their speed, efficiency and the high quality product finish.

“Once we’ve tendered we get a set of drawings, usually as a PDF, and build our Alphacam and Cabinet Vision designs from those. Those original drawings from the client usually just show a general design idea and we need to incorporate accurate measurements and technical details for our own production, and for other trades such as plumbing and electrical,” says Barry.

BSG’s designs regularly must take into account items which are not found in standard kitchens, such as large commercial fridges and commercial coffee machines.

“And we frequently have to begin manufacture before walls are even built, to keep within the project timeline. Therefore, we often agree measurements with the contractor without going on site to get drawings approved, and then change the dimensions again just before production. But it’s so easy to modify the Cabinet Vision models by dragging and dropping them, and changing their dimensions, so that the final NC code produces perfectly accurate cabinets for the room.”

In conclusion, Barry says the software has also enabled BSG to implement a degree of lean manufacturing within the company, which has helped change its business model.

“We saw considerable benefits as soon as we started using Cabinet Vision,” says Barry. “As it creates each bespoke NC file from the CAD model in the office, there is a lot less downtime on the Pratix, as the manual input has been greatly reduced.

“These efficiencies have made the process considerably faster. And the way parts are presented has improved with labelling from Cabinet Vision’s Label-IT, which means that nothing is forgotten once it has been inputted into the model. Anyone in the workshop can see a complete overview of the job.

“The manufacturing booklet created in Cabinet Vision shows what’s required for each project,” says Barry, “and the labels ensure an accurate flow of information from the office to the workshop, and finally for the fitters on site to see everything that’s required for the installation, even down to the number of hinges and handles, and that all the fittings are there.”
