Democrats dub Supreme Court's border wall ruling 'regrettable' and 'nonsensical',https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-dub-supreme-courts-border-wall-ruling-regrettable-and-nonsensical,"Democrats reacted with disappointment to Friday's Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to divert $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds for border wall construction.

The 5-4 ruling, which broke along ideological lines, means President Trump can tap into military funds to begin work to replace fencing along the southern border in California, Arizona and New Mexico. Earlier this month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had agreed with a lower-court ruling that prevented the government from tapping that funding.

Trump declared a national emergency along the border to get up to $8.1 billion for wall construction, including the $2.5 billion from the Defense Department. He called the ruling a big win for ""Border Security and the Rule of Law.""

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ‘LANDMARK AGREEMENT’ WITH GUATEMALA TO RESTRICT ASYLUM CLAIMS

""Wow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!"" he tweeted.

Prominent Democrats criticized the court's logic and Trump's plans to use earmarked funds in an effort to come through on his signature campaign issue. Many argue a wall will not slow the flow of migrants into the United States.

Arizona Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, whose district runs along the U.S.-Mexico border, called Trump's emergency declaration a ""pathetic attempt to circumvent Congress.""

""Trump’s fake emergency was nothing more than a pathetic ploy to circumvent Congress and build his monument to his racist policies. This fight is not over, and I will continue fighting Trump’s efforts to destroy our environment and militarize border communities. #NoBorderWall,"" he tweeted soon after the ruling broke.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the ruling ""deeply flawed"" over Twitter.

""This evening’s Supreme Court ruling allowing @realDonaldTrump to steal military funds to spend on a wasteful, ineffective border wall rejected by Congress is deeply flawed. Our Founders designed a democracy governed by the people — not a monarchy.""

For his part, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reminded his Twitter followers that when Trump was still a candidate for president, he promised that Mexico would pay for a border wall.

""It’s a sad day when the president is cheering a decision that may allow him to steal funds from our military to pay for an ineffective and expensive wall for which he promised Mexico would foot the bill,"" he posted.

He followed up with another tweet saying he hopes the courts will conclude Trump doesn't have the authority to build the wall.

Several Democratic presidential candidates also chimed in.

""Taking away money from the Defense Department to build a wall will not make us any safer. Trump’s political stunt will harm border communities & ignores the root causes of migration. We deserve a president with a common sense & compassionate immigration plan,"" former Housing Secretary Julian Castro tweeted.

Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, also in the running for the Democratic presidential nomination, likewise expressed disappointment.

""Deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision. I’ve long opposed building walls, and while in Congress, I introduced language to prevent DOD funds from being used to plan or build a wall along our border. As President, I would do everything in my power to make that law.""

""Congress did not appropriate these funds for Trump's medieval vanity project. Let's be clear: Trump's wall has never been about keeping the American people safe,"" tweeted California Sen. Kamala Harris.

""Diverting military funds for a vanity project is exactly who Donald Trump is. I will continue to fight back and join with those already challenging this wrong and misguided decision,"" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

The American Civil Liberties Union said it plans to fight to keep Trump from using the funds for a wall that's already been denied by Congress.

President Donald Trump Calls For Investigation Into Obama Book Deals,https://deadline.com,['Bruce Haring'],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://deadline.com/2019/07/president-donald-trump-obama-book-dealls-investigation-1202655260/,"Frustrated by continued efforts by the Democratic congress to find a reason to impeach him, President Donald Trump fought back today, saying that an investigation should be mounted on the book deals signed by former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.

The $65 million in multiple book deals spawned a best-seller for Michelle Obama, with Barack Obama’s memoir scheduled for some time next year.

Trump, speaking in the White House Oval Office on Friday, also called for an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, and put in a jab against Obama for ruining the White House air conditioning system, which he says can’t maintain a comfortable temperature.

The irritation by Trump was likely in response to the Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee stating that they were conducting an “impeachment investigation,” even after obtaining little new information from their big move, this week’s interrogation of Robert Mueller.

The Democrats today are now turning to have Mueller’s secret grand jury materials unsealed.

“All they want to do is impede. They want to investigate. They want to go fishing. And I watched Bob Mueller, and they have nothing,” Trump said. “There’s no collusion there’s no obstruction they have nothing. It’s a disgrace.”"
Donald Trump’s Entire Story About the Economy Fell Apart This Week,https://slate.com,['Jordan Weissmann'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/business/2019/07/trump-gdp-report-economy.html,"Donald Trump, maybe grimacing a little. Alex Wong/Getty Images

This week, much of the story that the White House likes to tell about its economic record fell apart.

It’s not just that growth appears to have slowed, though it has. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the country’s gross domestic product expanded at a middling 2.1 percent annual rate during the the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent over the first three months of 2019. This was only a preliminary estimate, a guesstimate really; the government will gather more data and revise that number in the coming months. But it was clearly worrisome to Donald Trump, who tried in vain to put a glass-half-full spin on the news while also placing blame for any weakness on his nemeses at the Federal Reserve.

Q2 GDP Up 2.1% Not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. Almost no inflation. USA is set to Zoom! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2019

Friday’s report also robbed the White House of a favorite talking point. Previously, the government believed that the economy grew by more than 3 percent in 2018, a mark it hadn’t hit in more than a decade. This milestone led Trump (or, really, his press shop) to boast that he had “accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” He was particularly jazzed that growth hit 4.1 percent for one quarter that year.

It turns out we didn’t reach 3 percent growth after all. In its annual data revisions, which also dropped Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew by just 2.5 percent or 2.9 percent in 2018, depending on exactly how you measure it. It also turns out that growth never actually hit 4 percent in the second quarter of 2018, which—despite being sort of meaningless—had been a point of pride for Trump. In short, goodbye, bragging rights.

Of course, whether or not our GDP growth rate managed to pass a somewhat arbitrary numerical threshold isn’t all that important in the scheme of things. But Friday’s numbers also dealt a deeper blow to the White House’s narrative about how it has supposedly resuscitated the economy from the doldrums of the late Obama years. Trump and his advisers like to claim that by loosening up regulations and cutting taxes on corporations, the administration unleashed a flood of new business investment that has helped push growth along. Their case has always been fairly flimsy: Much of the growth in business investment over the last couple of years was driven by the oil and gas industry, as frackers ramped up drilling in response to higher prices. Still, there was at least some uptick in business investment outside the fossil fuels sector that they could point to as proof that they were doing something right.

After the Commerce Department’s latest data revisions, that no longer seems to be the case. As Harvard Kennedy School economist and former Obama adviser Jason Furman notes, business investment outside of oil and mining has actually slowed down during the Trump administration. It’s possible the investment would be even weaker were it not for Trump’s tax cuts and deregulatory moves. But on the face of things, there’s really no obvious case to be made that they’ve unleashed a boom in business investment.

Jason Furman

In fact, it looks like we might even be heading into a bit of a bust. One major reason why growth slowed so much during the second quarter was that businesses actually cut back on overall investment for the first time since 2016. Somewhat ironically, much of that decline was due to retrenchment by the oil and gas industry, which until recently has been responsible for making Trump’s economic record look much stronger than it really is. Crude prices have had a rocky ride since 2018, and frackers have reduced their spending on new drills and other equipment. The retrenchment has been so severe that Halliburton, the biggest fracking services provider in the country, recently announced that it would lay off 8 percent of its North American workforce. Meanwhile, investment in other industries hasn’t been strong enough to pick up the slack. Donald Trump can’t control the price of oil. But he is responsible for the trade war with China, which has probably put a chill on some corporate spending.

Again, this could just be a blip, and it’s possible that as the data get revised, last quarter’s business investment might start to look stronger. But if it doesn’t, it won’t just be a strike against Trump’s story about the economy. It will also undercut years of conservative, supply-side orthodoxy. After all, when Republicans passed their massive corporate tax cut in 2017, their entire argument rested on the idea that it would lead to a surge in investment that would eventually lead to higher wages. Again, there’s no sign that has taken place. If the economy is reaping any benefit from the tax bill, it doesn’t seem to be strong enough to overcome the headwind of Donald Trump’s other rash decisions. Instead, what really appears to be driving the economy is a combination of consumer spending, perhaps plumped up by the tax cut, and federal deficits. The real story of the Trump economy, it seems, is about the power of stimulus spending—the sort of thing Republicans once claimed to hate."
Opinion | Trump’s Inhumanity Before a Victim of Rape,https://www.nytimes.com,['Roger Cohen'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/opinion/trump-nadia-murad-meeting.html,"Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Harvard professor and four-term United States senator from New York, famously observed, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.”

Today, everyone is entitled to his own facts, or their own facts, since even grammar has changed. The message from the Trump White House, and from Boris Johnson’s rise to prime minister in Britain, is that facts don’t matter. The bald-faced lie is perfectly acceptable, so long as it keeps you at the center of what passes today for attention. The important thing is to feed the machine. Shock is the best fodder. Social media dies without outrage.

In the mid-1930s, a few years before World War II, Robert Musil, the author of “The Man Without Qualities” wrote, “No culture can rest on a crooked relationship to truth.” The political culture of both the United States and Britain is sick. It is unserious, crooked and lethal. There is no honest way to dissociate the rise of Trump and Johnson from the societies that produced them.

The triumph of indecency is rampant. Choose your facts. The only blow Trump knows is the low one. As the gutter is to the stars, so is this president to dignity. Johnson does a grotesque Churchill number. Nobody cares. The wolves have it; the sheep, transfixed, shrug."
New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
He Made a Fake Presidential Seal.

You laugh in bewilderment, field questions from reporters, reckon with hateful messages and misinformation and, ultimately, embrace the spotlight in a whirlwind 24 hours that involves a call to your local police , just to be safe.

At least that’s how Charles Leazott handled it. He woke up Thursday morning to find that a spoof presidential seal he created last year on “a lark” to vent his frustration with President Trump had ended up onstage next to the president himself.

The seal, which made allusions to Russia and golf, was included onscreen at a conservative event on Tuesday hosted by Turning Point USA. The mix-up was apparently the result of a rushed Google search."
T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."
Donald Trump Gets Punked … By A Conservative Group?,https://www.fitsnews.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.fitsnews.com/2019/07/26/donald-trump-gets-punked-by-a-conservative-group/,"There is a crazy story coming out of our nation’s capital involving U.S. president Donald Trump, who dodged a major bullet this week when former U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller utterly bombed in a hearing that was supposed to have served as Democrats’ prelude to impeachment.

“If Democrats want to get rid of (Trump), they’re going to have to do it at the ballot box in November 2020,” noted Robert Romano for The Daily Torch. “There is not going to be any impeachment now.”

We agree … but Trump was humiliated in Washington, D.C. this week.

In a bizarre and yet-to-be-explained turn of events, a prominent conservative organization – Turning Point USA – embarrassed Trump during his appearance at the group’s “Teen Student Action Summit.”

What happened?

According to reporters Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler of The Washington Post, Trump’s appearance was marred by the presence of a fake presidential seal on a digital display behind him – one that mocked him as a “puppet” of the Russian government.

The graphic artist who created the fake seal “substituted the arrows in the eagle’s claw for a set of golf clubs – a nod to the president’s favorite pastime,” Thebault and Brice-Saddler noted.

“In the other set of talons, he swapped the olive branch for a wad of cash and replaced the United States’ Latin motto with a Spanish insult,” they added. “Then, his coup de grace: a two-headed imperial bird lifted straight from the Russian coat of arms, an homage to the president’s checkered history with the adversarial country.”

Take a look …

(Click to view)

(Via: Reddit)

The fact someone made this seal is sufficiently funny in its own right. The fact Trump appeared at an event – beaming and clapping while standing in front of it?

That is hilarious …

Adding a layer of intrigue? The group’s botched response to the scandal.

A spokesperson for Turning Point USA – a youth outreach group which claims to be “Winning America’s Culture War” – blamed the issue on a “last-minute oversight” and a “hasty Google search.”

The designer of the seal, 46-year-old Charles Leazott of Richmond, Virginia, called bull on that explanation.

“That’s a load of crap,” he told the Post. “You have to look for this. There’s no way this was an accident is all I’m saying.”

According to Leazott, the individual who found the seal online had to dig for it … meaning its on-screen placement during Trump’s appearance was deliberately malicious (contrary to Turning Point USA’s claims to the contrary).

While we find this entire episode amusing, our guess is Trump does not.

Of course Trump is likely more disappointed by the failure of groups like this to make a dent in his abysmal standing with millennial voters – who are going to comprise a huge chunk of the 2020 electorate.

"Crypto Assets Tank, Lose 5% in Minutes as Bitcoin Fails to Hold $10,000",https://www.newsbtc.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/07/27/crypto-assets-tank-lose-5-in-minutes-as-bitcoin-fails-to-hold-10000/,"Would you look at that — over the past 30 minutes, crypto assets have tanked. In a matter of about ten minutes, most large-cap altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin, shed approximately 5% on average.

The sell-off in the price of Bitcoin was the catalyst in this case, which in and of itself caught many traders with their pants down.

With this move, Bitcoin dominance slipped, falling by 0.4% as the crypto asset class dumped in unison. This means that relative to altcoins, BTC actually fell further.

This slight drop goes against the common trend seen in this phase in the cryptocurrency cycle, during which Bitcoin dominance actually rallied higher as BTC saw volatility.

What’s Next For the Crypto Market?

With this drop in mind, which sent Ethereum to flirt with $210, what exactly are analysts thinking is next? Well, for Bitcoin, a further move to the downside might just make sense.

According to Mohit Sorout, a crypto investor, Bitcoin closing under $9,500 on the four-hour chart will result in a subsequent move to $8,500.

Sorout’s expectations line up with those put forth by Mike Novogratz, the chief executive of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital. Novogratz yesterday told a Canadian television outlet that he expects for a healthy consolidation, with $8,500 being the key price point to watch over the next few weeks. He claims that this level, which is where the closest CME gap is, should act as a low in this move lower.

If the current trend in Bitcoin dominance continues, this move lower could result in altcoins continuing to rally against BTC even more.

T-Mobile-Sprint merger gains Justice Department OK thanks to Dish,https://www.cnet.com,['Eli Blumenthal'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-and-sprint-deal-wins-justice-department-ok-thanks-to-dish/,"Josh Miller/CNET

After more than a year of regulatory battles, T-Mobile's $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint is this close to happening. Justice Department antitrust head Makan Delrahim said Friday that the DOJ will approve the deal because T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom signed an agreement to sell off several Sprint assets to Dish Network, creating a new nationwide wireless carrier.

Under the agreement, Dish will acquire Sprint's 800Mhz wireless spectrum, Sprint's prepaid brands -- Boost, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid -- and their combined 9.3 million customers, as well as network agreements that will allow Dish to use T-Mobile's network for seven years while it builds out its own 5G network.

Now playing: Watch this: T-Mobile-Sprint merger: What it means for you

T-Mobile and Sprint will also need to give Dish access to ""at least 20,000 cell sites"" as well as ""hundreds of retail locations."" In a joint press release, T-Mobile and Sprint say that Dish will be able to ""take on leases for certain cell sites and retail locations that are decommissioned by the New T-Mobile for five years"" after the divestiture closes.

Dish will pay T-Mobile approximately $5 billion for the assets it is acquiring: $1.4 billion for the prepaid businesses and $3.6 billion for the spectrum.

The move could reshape the wireless industry and shake up where you get your wireless service. The deal gives Dish the tools to quickly enter the wireless business by accessing T-Mobile's network. T-Mobile, meanwhile, will combine with Sprint to create a much tougher competitor for AT&T and Verizon in the US wireless market. T-Mobile has argued that its combination with Sprint will supercharge its deployment of 5G across the country, as well as expand its customer reach and scale to match the Big Two: AT&T and Verizon.

At the close of the deal, which T-Mobile says it expects will be in the second half of 2019, Sprint's prepaid businesses and customers will ""immediately move to Dish, as will the more than 400 employees and nationwide independent retail network that supports more than 7,500 retail outlets,"" Dish said in a statement.

There remains some questions about Dish's legitimacy as a wireless player -- one of the primary concerns of the state attorneys general that have sued to block to merger. Dish, after all, has shown little interest before in starting its own wireless service despite sitting on a mountain of valuable spectrum.

But CEO John Legere offered a rare defense of an outside company.

""Dish will be a very credible disruptive fourth player,"" Legere said on a call with analysts and media on Friday.

Double impact

Exactly when Dish will enter the market, however, is unclear as it needs to wait on the completion of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger before it can take on the divested assets. The company, however, says that it will have a ""5G broadband network capable of serving 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023.""

T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said Dish and the other wireless resellers will be able to access its upcoming 5G network right away. A decade ago when 4G was on the rise, the carriers were protective of its then-new network, preventing so-called mobile virtual network operators from using it. Likewise, the company will honor all reseller agreements that Sprint has, including a deal with cable provider Altice.

Now playing: Watch this: How fast is T-Mobile's 5G network? We took it for a test...

Dish has long sought to enter the wireless business. It's been accumulating billions of dollars' worth of wireless airwaves in recent spectrum auctions, facing a deadline of March 2020 to put that to use or risk losing its license. Dish previously said it was working on a narrowband wireless network for ""internet of things"" devices -- such as smart thermostats, energy meters, traffic lights and security systems -- although that network isn't designed for mobile phones and tablets.

As part of the deal it made with the DOJ and T-Mobile, Dish says that it has ""requested that its spectrum licenses be modified"" to reflect its new promise of deploying a 5G network that covers by 70 percent of the population by June 2023.

Dish has made plenty of promises for an eventual wireless 5G network. But through the T-Mobile deal it will be able to offer wireless calling, texting and data services on the combined T-Mobile-Sprint network while it builds out its own service.

Dish could follow in Sprint's footsteps with aggressive offers to try to court subscribers away from the new Big Three, but that play didn't work out for Sprint in the long term. But in recent years, both Sprint and T-Mobile put pressure on AT&T and Verizon with unlimited data plans, cheaper monthly rates and bundles that added subscriptions to services such as Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Tidal and Amazon Prime.

Friday's ""developments are the fulfillment of more than two decades' worth of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments intended to transform DISH into a connectivity company,"" said Dish co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen in a statement. ""Taken together, these opportunities will set the stage for our entry as the nation's fourth facilities-based wireless competitor and accelerate our work to launch the country's first standalone 5G broadband network.""

""It's a big win for US leadership in 5G,"" Brendan Carr, the Republican Federal Communications Commissioner, said in an interview. He agrees with the argument that the combined companies can build a network that neither could do alone.

T-Mobile, meanwhile, gets the size and customer base to better compete with its larger rivals. The telecom business has been dependent on scale, with a larger subscriber base funding investments in network upgrades. T-Mobile will be keeping Sprint's 2.5Ghz spectrum, the radiowaves Sprint is already using to deploy 5G in five cities across the country. That's a valuable swath of spectrum as the company looks to roll 5G to a broader portion of the country.

""With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amounts of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,"" said Delrahim.

Pricing changes?

When asked about whether this deal would lead to an end of an era of aggressive promotions and cheaper plans, T-Mobile Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert dismissed the notion.

""We're going to take the enhanced capability and go after AT&T and Verizon like they've never seen before,"" he said.

T-Mobile has agreed to lock in prices for the next three years, although it hasn't talked about Sprint's plans. Legere hinted at big things ahead.

""We'll waste no time making it clear what this network is capable of,"" he said, also dismissing the notion that T-Mobile would become fat and arrogant like its rivals.

Sievert also reiterated the company's plans to eventually offer 100 megabits per second of coverage to 99% of Americans, and Ray talked about its existing plans to offer nationwide 5G by next year.

Challenges still lie ahead

While the DOJ decision smooths the path for the T-Mobile-Sprint deal, it's not signed, sealed and delivered just yet.

Thirteen state attorneys general, as well as the District of Columbia, have filed a multistate lawsuit to block the T-Mobile-Sprint deal on the grounds that it will lead to higher prices and less competition. Although the new agreement paves the way for Dish to replace Sprint as a fourth wireless carrier, it remains to be seen whether the states will continue to pursue their legal action.

In addition to brokering a deal between T-Mobile and Dish, the DOJ also reached a settlement with five state attorneys general offices: Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

It has not yet reached an agreement with New York or California, which are leading the lawsuit against the merger. In a statement released by New York Attorney General Letitia James the group of 13 states, as well as the District of Columbia, reinforced their opposition to the deal, citing Dish's previous broken promises and its reliance on using T-Mobile's network for ""for the foreseeable future.""

""The promises made by Dish and T-Mobile in this deal are the kinds of promises only robust competition can guarantee,"" said James in a statement. ""We have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger's harm to consumers, workers, and innovation.""

""A marketplace with fewer active competitors drives up costs, reduces consumer choice and thwarts innovation,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ""We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide.""

The California Public Utilities Commission also needs to give its blessing to the deal, and a report Wednesday said that cable giant Charter wanted to bid on Sprint assets but never heard back from the DOJ. It's unclear what possible implications that news might have on T-Mobile's deals with both Sprint and Dish.

On the call, Legere said the priority is to work out the concerns of the state AGs as well as the California commission. Sievert said the companies wouldn't move forward on the deal without ending the litigation first.

Different technologies

There's also the wrinkle of having to integrate two networks with different technologies. T-Mobile has a mixture of 5G, 4G LTE and 3G based on GSM technology. Sprint, meanwhile, has 5G, 4G LTE and a 3G technology called CDMA.

Working in the companies' favor: Many popular 4G handsets, including recent iPhones and Galaxy phones, pack support for both carriers' networks. Google's Fi already seamlessly switches between T-Mobile and Sprint for its mobile service.

But we've also seen what happens when integrations aren't handled properly. Sprint disastrously tried to straddle both network technologies when it merged with Nextel in 2005. T-Mobile faced a similar scenario when it purchased MetroPCS, which also used CDMA technology. But under T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray, T-Mobile smoothly transitioned customers off the old network.

This will all, of course, be happening at a much larger scale with Sprint, which has 54.5 million customers to go with T-Mobile's 83.1 million.

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""

"Barr directs federal government to reinstate death penalty, schedule the execution of 5 death row inmates",https://www.cnn.com,"['Tammy Kupperman', 'Ariane De Vogue', 'Veronica Stracqualursi']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/justice-department-capital-punishment-barr/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The federal government has ordered the death penalty to be reinstated for the first time in nearly two decades, as Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the execution of five inmates after adopting an updated execution protocol.

After 16 years without an execution, Barr has directed the head of the Bureau of Prisons to execute ""five death-row inmates convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly"" in December and January, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.

In his statement, Barr said the government was moving to seek justice against the ""worst criminals"" and bring relief to victims and family members. At the same time, however, the government's move is likely to reignite legal challenges to the specific protocol and reinvigorate a debate concerning the constitutionality of lethal injection.

The move represents a dramatic reversal after more than a decade-long hiatus in the federal use of capital punishment, as President Donald Trump has taken on the issue and called to ""bring back the death penalty."" The death penalty is legal in 29 states and the federal government, though there have been no federal executions in nearly two decades and the number of people facing state executions has been on the decline.

The debate over capital punishment has been longstanding, with advocates arguing it's a deterrent against serious crime and that justice is served for the victims or victims' families. Opponents, however, point to the racial disparities of death row inmates, the financial costs, and wrongful convictions.

At Barr's direction, the Bureau of Prisons has adopted the Federal Execution Protocol Addendum which ""replaces the three-drug procedure previously used in federal executions with a single drug—pentobarbital,"" the Justice Department announced.

Thursday's announcement by DOJ to schedule the executions of five death row inmates follows an effort begun by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the federal government to restart executions by lethal injection.

Sessions had asked the Bureau of Prisons to determine a way to proceed.

The directive from Sessions for the Bureau of Prisons to determine a way to resume the use of the death penalty was recently concluded after a thorough legal and procedural review, a Justice official said.

Potential legal challenges ahead

Barr's announcement directs the federal government to use a new protocol — similar to what several states use — that has been under review for a number of years.

The executions have been ordered to begin later this year, but could be delayed by legal challenges. Legal experts question whether any execution will take place as soon as December.

""Saying that you are going to adopt a protocol is not the same thing as having a protocol properly adopted through the required administrative procedures,"" said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a group that has been critical of how the penalty is administered. ""You can't just say it and have it happen. There is a legal process for a protocol to go into effect and there is a legal process for challenging the protocol.""

Dunham predicts that there will be opposition once the protocol is formally proposed.

Already in the District of Columbia there has been an ongoing lawsuit involving the federal lethal injection process. There will be a range of questions about how the federal government is obtaining the drug it intends to use.

The five federal inmates ordered to be executed are Daniel Lewis Lee for murdering a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl; Lezmond Mitchell for murdering a 63-year-old and her 9-year-old granddaughter; Wesley Ira Purkey for raping and murdering a 16-year-old girl; Alfred Bourgeois for torturing and killing his own 2-year-old daughter; Dustin Lee Honken, for shooting and killing five people, including two young girls.

A Federal Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman told CNN that per statute, the director of the BOP designates the date and time for an execution.

""BOP will continue with planning and administrative steps to ensure the execution is ready to commence on the designated date and time,"" spokeswoman, Nancy Ayers, said.

An official from the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, where each man is scheduled to be executed in the coming months, deferred comment to BOP.

The attorney for Lee— the inmate scheduled to be put to death first under the new procedure and who has been on death row since 1999 — argued that ""executing (Lee) would be a grave injustice"" given the ""unreliability of the evidence"" and that ""his indisputably more culpable"" co-defendant, Chevie Kehoe, received a life sentence.

""Given the problems that undermine the fairness and reliability of Danny Lee's conviction and death sentence, the Government should not move forward with his execution,"" said Morris Moon, Lee's attorney.

Inmates on death row

There are currently 62 inmates on federal death row, with about the same number of white and black federal death-row inmates, according to the Death Penalty Information Center . Capital punishment is legal in 29 US states. There are about 2,600 death row inmates, with California detaining the most.

According to the center, of the five men named by Barr Thursday, three are white, one is black, and one is Native American.

Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a 16-year moratorium.

Louis Jones, a Gulf War veteran, was the last federal inmate executed in March 2003 for the kidnapping and murder of 19-year-old Army Pvt. Tracie McBride.

Democrats criticize Trump administration decision

The two Democratic senators from California expressed dismay over the Trump administration's decision to resume the death penalty.

""Let me be clear: capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed,"" Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, said on Twitter. ""Too many innocent people have been put to death. We need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection.""

Harris, who is also a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has personally opposed the death penalty. But when she was California's attorney general, she filed an appeal that ultimately restarted California's use of the death penalty under then-Gov. Jerry Brown. In March, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom placed a moratorium on the death penalty, making California the fourth state to put a pause on capital punishment, though the length and reasoning for the moratoriums vary from state to state.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called it ""wrong"" and argued that the federal government should be ""leading the effort to end this brutal and often cruel punishment, not advocating for its return.""

""It's time we evolve and put this terrible practice behind us,"" she added.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose home state has abolished the death penalty, argued that the US criminal justice system ""has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment—especially when it comes to Black and Brown people.""

""We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans,"" Warren said on Twitter.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also running for president, too disavowed the announcement, saying on Twitter, ""There's enough violence in the world. The government shouldn't add to it."" He also pledged to abolish the death penalty if elected president."
What Democrats can learn from the Mueller hearings debacle: Only way to boot Trump is beat him in 2020,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/what-democrats-can-learn-from-the-mueller-hearings-debacle-only-way-to-boot-trump-is-beat-him-in-2020,"The long-awaited testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller did one main thing: confirm that the Democratic Party's impeachment dreams are over. Now, it's more apparent than ever that the Left's only hope to remove President Trump from office will be through a 2020 election victory of their own.

Each member of the voting public has known who Trump is all along. His most ardent supporters will never be swayed to abandon him due to real or imaginary concerns, of which there are plenty. His greatest detractors are just as passionate in their beliefs that the 45th president is wholly unworthy of the high office. Yes, the GOP must eventually address the elasticity of their principles in this era. But while Republicans have issues of their own, Democrats continue to show how blinded they are by their incessant calls for impeachment.

Demanding removal of Trump began almost immediately. Some who entered Congress following their own victories in the 2018 midterms, like Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, have made impeachment a central goal from the start. However, wanting something done and having the ability and mechanism to see it through to completion are entirely different things.

Given that the public's desire to see impeachment proceedings commence isn't very high, it makes little sense for the Democrats to expend energy heading that direction especially while they're in the midst of another presidential election cycle. Even though almost 100 Democrats in the House are eager for progress to be made on this front, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is holding firm against moving the same direction.

With more than 20 candidates in the race for president, the party as a whole seems to agree that beating Trump on the ballot is their most realistic chance at actually removing him from office. Even though the general election matchups between their higher-polling candidates and the incumbent allows for little to no confidence, this avenue remains their best bet. Launching impeachment proceedings would certainly feel great, but with a DOA outcome in the Senate, the attempt would accomplish nothing more than angering the MAGA base even further. And that, on the eve of an election, would be impossible to overcome.

Democrats have yet to realize that any current demands for impeachment only solidify Trump's 2020 prospects. These calls to impeach are propelled by a less than definitive report and lackluster testimony. With no bombshells in their arsenal, their desperation serves more like a re-election advertisement for Trump than anything else.

If a slam dunk case for impeachment existed, this would cause the average American voter to pay a modicum of attention to the messy, daily drama in Washington. But even many politicos who dislike and distrust the president know that no such case exists. The men and women who will head to the polls on Nov. 3, 2020, are more concerned with how decisions in Washington affect their bottom line, job prospects, children's future and education, and sense of security. The substance of their collective concern is not whether impeachment is seriously considered by politicians who have been looking for a smoking gun all along. Legislators should be focused on the people's business and not on exhausting, partisan maneuvering. The latter will quickly turn a regular member of the electorate away come decision day.

This week destroyed the Democratic Party's short-term goal for dealing with the ""Trump problem."" It remains to be seen whether or not they understand just how nearsighted their focus has been in the first place.

Trump warns Google after Treasury chief says no concerns on China,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-trump/trump-warns-google-after-treasury-chief-says-no-concerns-on-china-idUSKCN1UL210,"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday kept up his pressure on global tech giant Google days after his Treasury secretary ruled out any national security concerns over the company’s work in China.

Trump, in a tweet, did not offer any evidence of a problem with Google’s business in China but said if there were any issues, his administration would find out about it.

On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he and Trump had both had direct talks with Google’s chief executive and were assured that the tech company’s work with China was “very, very limited.”

“The president and I did diligence on this issue, and we’re not aware of any areas where Google working with the Chinese government in a way that in any way raises concerns,” Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. “Google is an American company that wants to help out the U.S.”

Trump has repeatedly slammed U.S. technology companies, including Google, and alleged without offering any evidence that they have discriminated against him and fellow conservatives. He met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a White House meeting on Monday with a number of other top tech executives.

“There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem, we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. Earlier this month, the company’s top government affairs official said at a U.S. Senate hearing that it did little business in China.

“Fundamentally in China we actually do very little today, certainly compared to any other major technology company,” said Karan Bhatia, vice president for government affairs and public policy.

Alphabet shares rose 11% in midday trading on its strong earnings results released Thursday."
New food stamp rule proposal: How it affects you,https://www.11alive.com,"['Author', 'Jonathan Raymond', 'Published', 'Am Edt July', 'Updated']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.11alive.com/article/news/new-food-stamp-rule-proposal-how-it-affects-you/85-94fcc19c-7adc-4299-8d7e-67a6bfa4866c,"ATLANTA — The government proposed new, stricter rules on Tuesday for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), popularly known as food stamps.

The new restrictions, if they go into effect, could affect thousands of Georgia families.

If you believe you’d be affected, here are some things to know:

The rules aren’t in place yet: Tuesday’s announcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was just a proposal. A 60-day period for public comment will be open at www.regulations.gov where people can voice their opinions.

In Georgia, 70.7 percent of families were on both programs, according to the most recent data in 2017. How much TANF assistance you receive could be the determining factor: The government said it wants to limit automatic SNAP eligibility to TANF families who have received a minimum of $50 a month for at least six months. The government says it is trying to limit cases where people can draw SNAP benefits thanks to TANF assistance as little as receiving an informational brochure.

It could also depend on the kind of assistance you receive: The government says that non-cash TANF benefits can also allow you to become SNAP eligible. It wants to restrict those kinds of benefits to only ones that “support work” like subsidized employment or childcare.

So should you be worried? It depends. The government has not said yet how it would notify people of their change in status or when it would take effect if the new rule is adopted.

It also hasn’t said, for instance, if people who have received $50 a month for the last six months would automatically qualify under the new standards, or if they would have to start over and wait six months to establish their eligibility again.

It’s possible there are cases where families are eligible for SNAP, but originally qualified for the program through their TANF eligibility, and would have to reapply for their food stamps.

Déjà vu: Mueller again causes confusion on his reason for not charging Trump,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deja-vu-mueller-again-causes-confusion-on-his-reason-for-not-charging-trump,"Robert Mueller caused confusion during his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee as he appeared to contradict Attorney General William Barr, as well as declined to stand by a previous official statement from his own special counsel’s office, related to the decision-making behind not charging President Trump with any crimes.

Mueller’s report did not reach a determination on obstruction of justice in his 448-page report, although he laid out 10 possible instances of obstruction. Mueller’s report referenced a longtime Office of Legal Counsel opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but his report did not explicitly claim that that was the only reason Trump wasn’t charged in the investigation. Moreover, Barr said in April that Mueller told him that Mueller was not saying that he would have charged Trump with a crime but for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and, in addition, a joint statement from the offices of Mueller and Barr in May reiterated that point.

But Wednesday, Mueller appeared to reverse course, appearing to say that he would have charged Trump with a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California asked, “I’d like to ask you the reason, again, you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?”

“That is correct,” Mueller said.

Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona pressed him on this, saying “that is not what you said in the report and that is not what you told Attorney General Barr.” Lesko also pointed to the joint statement he put out earlier this year, saying there was no daylight between himself and Barr on that issue. She quoted from that statement, reading, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice.”

“So, Mr. Mueller, do you stand by your joint statement that you issued on May 29th as you sit here today?” Lesko asked.

Mueller declined to stand by the official statement from his own office from less than two months ago.

“I would have to look at it more closely before I said I agree with it,” Mueller said.

“My conclusion is that what you told Mr. Lieu really contradicts what you said in the report and what you said apparently repeatedly to Attorney General Barr,” Lesko replied. “And then you issued a joint statement on May 29.”

Lesko was referencing a nearly identical controversy which took place following Mueller’s press conference in late May. “The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,"" Mueller said at that time. ""The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation.""

After Mueller's roughly nine-minute statement, politicians, pundits, and journalists interpreted Mueller’s remarks as a clear break from what Barr stated, suggesting that Mueller was saying that the only reason he didn’t charge Trump was the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

But Barr said in April that he and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Mueller in early March and that they “specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion.”

“And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position,” Barr said in April. “He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime.”

Barr and Rosenstein concluded that obstruction had not occurred.

After the May press conference, the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel put on a united front that was intended to end speculation that Mueller contradicted Barr on the decision-making on whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice during his public address.

“The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements,"" a joint statement from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec and Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said at the time.

Before the joint statement came out, Mueller's office released a handout comparing his assertions about obstruction of justice to what Barr said about it. The document, which apparently sought to provide context, contained quotes from Barr's press conference before the release of Mueller's report in which he said Mueller repeatedly assured him that he did not think they would have found a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduces bill to abolish federal death penalty after DOJ reinstates it,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-death-penalty-rep-ayanna-pressley-introduces-bill-to-abolish-capital-punishment-after-doj-reinstates-it/,"Just after the Department of Justice reversed a 16-year rule banning the use of capital punishment, Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley said the death penalty has ""no place in a just society."" In response, the Massachusetts congresswoman is introducing a bill that would reverse the action and abolish the death penalty altogether.

While short on details, the bill aims to ""prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any violation of Federal law, and for other purposes."" It's the latest piece of legislation introduced by Pressley, a member of the so-called ""squad"" of progressive Democratic congresswomen, that directly counters the Trump administration.

""The same racist rhetoric coming from the occupant of the White House, who called for the execution of the #Exonerated5, is what led to this racist, vile policy,"" Pressley tweeted, remarking on Mr. Trump's past claims that the wrongly convicted ""Central Park Five"" should face the death penalty for their alleged crimes.

""It was wrong then and it's wrong now. The cruelty is the point - this is by design,"" she added.

Pressley tweeted out an image of the bill. It states, if enacted, ""no person may be sentenced to death or put to death on or after the date of enactment of this act for any violation of federal law."" It notes that those who were sentenced before the bill's enactment should be re-sentenced for their crimes.

On Thursday, Attorney General William Barr anounced that his DOJ was bringing back capital punishment after more than 16 years without a single federal execution. Barr has now directed the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to adopt a change to the federal execution protocol to make it possible to execute inmates on death row.

In doing so, Barr directed the BOP's Acting Director Hugh Hurwitz to schedule executions for five convicted murderers, and the Justice Department says more executions will be scheduled soon.

The bill currently has support from the likes of Pressley's ""squad"" co-members Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among 11 other Democrats. It also has support from Rep. Justin Amash, formerly of the Republican party."

Sanjuana Galicia from Facebook via CNN Francisco Galicia, who was born in Dallas and is a US citizen, was released from ICE custody on Tuesday after spending three weeks behind bars, his lawyer told CNN.

The Texas-born high school student who was detained by immigration officials for more than three weeks told CNN Thursday he was treated less than human at a US Customs and Border Protection facility.

Francisco Galicia, 18, says he was held in filthy, overcrowded conditions where he was not allowed to shower for 23 days, forced to sleep on a cement floor and not given enough food. By the time he was released Tuesday, after word spread about his detention following a report by The Dallas Morning News, he said he was malnourished, having dropped 26 pounds.

""They were not treating us humanely,"" Galicia told CNN during a wide-ranging interview. ""...The stress was so high, they (detention center agents) were on me all the time. It was like psychological torture to the point where I almost (agreed to be deported). I felt safer to be in the cell than to be with the officers. ""

'They threatened me with charges'

The problem began, he says, on June 27 while he was on his way to a college soccer scouting event.

He was traveling with his 17-year-old brother Marlon, as well as a group of friends, from his hometown of Edinburg to Houston when they were stopped at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias, about 100 miles north of the US-Mexico border.

Francisco Galicia was born in Texas, and he is an American citizen. As a child, he moved to Mexico with his family and later returned to the US as a teenager. He says he was carrying his state ID, a Social Security card and a wallet-sized birth certificate.

He also had a Mexican tourist visa with him that inaccurately listed his country of birth as Mexico, setting up a conflicting nationality claim, his attorney, Claudia Galan, said.

Both brothers were detained, and Marlon Galicia, who does not have legal status in the US, was retuned to Mexico. Francisco Galicia was sent to an immigration detention center.

""They didn't believe me. I kept telling them over and over, and they kept saying my documents were fake, and they were going to deport me,"" Galicia said. ""...They threatened me with charges -- charges about falsifying documents. Felonies. They kept asking how it was possible for me to not know where I was from. I almost signed (to be deported) because I didn't want to suffer there anymore. ""

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials declined a CNN request for comment on Galicia's allegations and pointed back to a joint ICE-CBP statement on Wednesday following the teen's release.

""This individual provided conflicting reports regarding status of citizenship after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol and transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody,"" the statement said.

The statement continued, ""Situations including conflicting reports from the individual and multiple birth certificates can, and should, take more time to verify. While we continue to research the facts of the situation, the individual has been released from ICE custody.""

'You have no rights'

Galicia said he was not allowed to call his family or an attorney while he was detained.

""The moment I got there, we told them we have the right to a phone call and to a lawyer, and they told us, 'you have no rights,'"" he said.

Galicia described squalid conditions in the facility where he was held, saying he was held in a small room with about 70 other people. There was one toilet, with no doors or wall.

Every few days, he said, he and those held with him were given wipes.

""It was to clean up but the dirt, but you couldn't get rid of it because so much time had passed since we showered,"" he said.

Galicia dismissed President Donald Trump's assertion that many of the people crossing the border are ""bad actors,"" who mean to do harm to the US and its people. He said the people he met who were being held with him at the facility meant no harm.

""They just wanted to come for a better future. They were fleeing their countries because they were being threatened or kidnapped,"" he said.

Attorney says she was given the runaround

While Galicia was being held, an attorney retained by his family said she tried for a least a week to get in touch with the teen while he was being held but was given the runaround by CBP and ICE.

Galan says she tried in vain for at least a week to get in touch with Galicia while he was being held, but was given the runaround by Border Patrol.

""They told him he had no right to an attorney,"" Galan said. ""Once I went to border patrol headquarters, they told me the same thing. ... They said that I couldn't get any information until he consented, but he didn't even know I was trying to get him out.""

Galan has said she shared documents two weeks ago with CBP proving Galicia was a US citizen -- including a birth certificate showing he was born in Dallas.

Despite the documentation, the attorney said, Galicia was transferred on Saturday to ICE custody for removal proceedings. He was held in the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall until his release Tuesday.

By the time he was released, he had been detained for 27 days: one day at the border patrol checkpoint, 23 days at the Falfurrias processing center and three days in Pearsall.

'I am the eyes and the ears of what's happening'

Galicia showed CNN pieces of paper that he said contained phone numbers of the families of those held with him.

""They asked me to reach out to them to let them know that they're OK. They didn't want me to tell them about the conditions in the detention centers -- they only wanted me to tell them that they were OK,"" he said.

""...Right now, I'm in a place where I can help those who are still in there -- so people can see how they're treated, and change the way they're treated. I am the eyes and ears of what's happening in there. I can talk. They can't do what I'm doing. ""

Galicia says he doesn't know if he will take legal action against the CBP, but he does want a measure of justice.

He said he remains a positive person despite being treated so badly.

""It's made me stronger,"" he said. ""I see life differently after seeing how other people have been suffering. It's made me understand many things like how you can live your life while others are suffering.""

"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says",https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-says-bitcoin-escrow-firm-bilked-investors-for-7-million,"U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

US Treasury Secretary: Amazon ‘destroyed the retail industry across the United States’,https://www.wraltechwire.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.wraltechwire.com/2019/07/25/us-treasury-secretary-amazon-destroyed-the-retail-industry-across-the-united-states/,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supports the Justice Department’s formal antitrust review of the country’s largest tech companies, particularly Amazon, which he said has ruined retail.

In an interview Wednesday with CNBC, Mnuchin said the company has “destroyed the retail industry across the United States” and said there’s “no question they’ve limited competition.”

Regarding the wide-ranging investigation announced Tuesday by the Department of Justice, Mnuchin said it’s “absolutely right” that Attorney General William Barr has started it.

The wide-ranging review could examine numerous firms that have been targets of criticism for having anti-competitive behavior. No specific companies were named in the release, but the Justice Department said it was looking into “market-leading online platforms,” which could include Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” it said in the press release.

Mnuchin said Amazon’s dominance is different from Walmart because the latter company has “developed a business where small businesses could continue to compete with them.”

In response to Mnuchin’s comment, Amazon said small and medium-sized businesses are “thriving” on the platform.

“Today, independent sellers make up more than 58% of physical gross merchandise sales on Amazon, and their sales have grown twice as fast as our own, totaling $160 billion in 2018,” Amazon said a in statement to CNN Business.

It added: “Amazon’s retail business competes in the worldwide market for retail sales and represents less than 1% of global retail and less than 4% of U.S. retail. And the vast majority of retail sales — 90% — still occur in brick-and-mortar stores according to the US Census Bureau.”

Several aspects of Amazon’s business have attracted the attention of politicians.

Last week, Amazon representatives testified at a House hearing about online platforms and market power. The company’s dominance was questioned. According to eMarketer, it accounts for nearly 50% of the US e-commerce market."
Trump rightly threatens tariffs on France,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-rightly-threatens-tariffs-on-france,"Whether Chablis, Sancerre, or Pomerol, French wine is better than American wine.

But President Trump is right to threaten tariffs over a French tax on U.S. technology companies. Trump explained his position on Twitter.

France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly. I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2019

Don't get me wrong, I support free trade. But free trade must flow both ways. In turn, the U.S. cannot sit idle when other nations take unfair advantage of American companies. And tariffs offer a rough but effective tool to force reconsideration of unfair actions.

Such is the case with France's technology tax.

That tax is extraordinarily unfair in its undue impact on U.S. technology firms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Protecting French technology firms by targeting higher-earning U.S. firms, France is punishing American firms for being better. It's an attack on the American economy in protectionist benefit of France's struggling socialist economy. France must know that it cannot act unfairly against America and expect us to simply sit back and smile.

Hopefully President Emmanuel Macron will reconsider his tax. France is a close U.S. ally, and both our nations have a vested interest in expanded trade and cooperation. But trade must be fair and free. Whether abroad or at home, U.S. technology firms are a crown jewel of our economy. As in this case, they deserve protection."
Illinois EPA cites company for south suburban water woes,https://wgntv.com,"['Ben Bradley', 'Joe Donlon', 'Wgn Investigates']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://wgntv.com/2019/07/26/illinois-epa-cites-company-for-south-suburban-water-woes/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

UNIVERSITY PARK, Ill. — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has hit a private water provider with notice of several violations after high lead levels were detected in several south suburbs. Aqua Illinois first notified its customers in University Park, Green Garden and Monee Township about high lead levels on June 14. Nearly six weeks later, 1,500 households remain under a “do not consume” advisory.

Aqua Illinois officials have blamed the spike in lead levels to a change in the chemicals it uses to treat the water. The Illinois EPA now says the company failed to obtain the necessary permits to make those changes, a violation of IEPA rules.

State regulators also fault Aqua Illinois for failing to properly monitor and report water quality test results last year.

""Your supply did not collect the required number of sample results from a certified laboratory,” the IEPA violation notice reads. All required lead and copper samples were not collected for the July-December 2018 monitoring period in University Park, according to the IEPA.

Aqua Illinois denies any alleged violations contributed to the lead problem or the difficulty in solving it. “We don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park,” the company wrote in a statement.

University Park mayor Joseph Roudez has previously criticized the private water provider for not providing the community with water quality reports prior to June.

Aqua Illinois revealed Friday that it has suspended four members of its management and professional team while the company examined the details of the IEPA’s findings.

University Park officials say they were led to believe the problem would be resolved within several days, a claim Aqua Illinois disputes. The water crisis in these south suburban communities is now in its second month.

“It could take several months before this is resolved,” Aqua Illinois president Craig Blanchette told WGN’s Joe Donlon.

In the most recent community update posted July 22, Aqua Illinois officials said “water lead test results in University Park have fluctuated, both increasing an decreasing in some areas. It’s not unusual to see this fluctuation, particularly in the first few months of treatment.”

“We acknowledge that while we all would have hoped to see treatment showing progress, it hasn’t had enough time yet,” reads a statement on Aqua Illinois’ website for residents effected by the water problems.

Aqua Illinois officials insist older homes impacted by the high lead levels will see their numbers subside when residents let water run for 2-3 minutes first thing in the morning. They’ve provided residents with filters and bottled water.

Blanchette provided WGN with the following statement:

""Aqua Illinois is committed to operating with complete transparency with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We have been working closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators since we issued the voluntary do not consume advisory June 14, and immediately launched an internal investigation. To date, we have identified the likely cause of elevated lead levels in a limited number of homes is due to water chemistry interacting with lead solder in the internal plumbing of homes built prior to 1990. (Lead solder was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1986). As part of our commitment to resolve this situation, we have engaged nationally renowned experts in this field to complement our team’s efforts. Related Story

Hundreds attend emergency meeting on water lead levels in south suburbs Aqua Illinois leadership makes every effort to comply with all federal and state regulations. We recently learned that IEPA has issued several regulatory violations relating to permitting and sampling. Although we continue working to gather the necessary information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what took place, it is important to note we don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park. We want our customers to know that we take these actions very seriously and are actively working with the IEPA on a resolution. Among the matters raised by the IEPA are permitting actions that took place in 2018. Aqua Illinois has since addressed these issues. During the process to change sources from well water to the Kankakee River, we installed a water main and changed treatment locations prior to receiving an IEPA permit. Though the changes were made prior to receiving the permits, the IEPA ultimately did issue the permits. The delay in applying for the permits, though it was eventually approved by the IEPA in 2018, was an oversight on our part. To correct this process, effective immediately, we have updated internal permit management practices to strengthen oversight of our permitting activities. The other issues raised by the IEPA involve the method of selecting sampling locations during the second half of 2018. Based upon our own investigation, we learned, and proactively advised the IEPA, that several homes selected for compliance sampling did not meet the proper criteria due to the age of the homes. We have addressed this issue, adding about 40 pre-1986 sampling locations to the existing sample set, thanks to the cooperation of our customers. This ensures that our lead testing correctly represents the various property types, ages, and plumbing construction in the community. As part of our holistic examination of the matter, Aqua has been and will continue to evaluate changes to processes and personnel to ensure we correct this situation and continue to improve our service for our customers and communities. As part of this process, Aqua has taken immediate action by suspending four members of the Aqua Illinois management and professional team while we thoroughly examine all the details around the IEPA’s findings. As a company, we collectively work each day with integrity, respect and in the pursuit of excellence in all we do, and we are accountable when we fall short of those values. The safety of our system is our top priority. We will continue to work with regulators, our own team and national water experts to restore and maintain safe drinking water for our customers."""

Ethics Probes Launched at Department of the Interior and EPA,https://undark.org,"['Jane Roberts', 'Frankie Schembri', 'Ek Silbergeld', 'Big Wayne', 'Seeker Of Truth', 'Even When Ugly', 'Peter George']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://undark.org/2019/07/26/ethics-probe-interior-department-epa-july-2019/,"Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visits oil rig manufacturer Watson Hopper Inc. in Hobbs, New Mexico.

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients. The pair urged EPA officials not to “abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

• An unprecedented and lethal heatwave swept across Europe this week, breaking records in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom. As of Friday morning, French authorities reported at least five deaths linked to the rising temperatures. There, temperatures topped 108 degrees Fahrenheit; in Germany, 106.7 degrees; Belgium 105 degrees; and in the Netherlands, 104 degrees. The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing. If successful, LightSail 2 will be the first steerable solar sail to orbit Earth. With silvery sails roughly the size of a boxing ring, it may, at times, be visible from Earth with the naked eye, according to the Planetary Society. (Gizmodo)"

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

After remaining silent for nearly two years – with the exception of a brief statement expressing his reluctance to speak before Congress – former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before two U.S. House committees about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and President Donald Trump’s actions around that investigation.

Mueller, who was subpoenaed to testify following the release of a more than 400-page report addressing Russian interference into the campaign and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, frequently referred to the report as he testified before members of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Select Permanent Committee on Intelligence.

Mueller told representatives that his investigation did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice charges and he explained why he did not subpoena Trump even though the president refused to sit down with Mueller's prosecutors.

The origins of the investigation, again

10 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asks Mueller about the origins of the investigation. Mueller says he would not talk about that, as he said in his opening statement.

Jordan says a number of Trump associates were charged with false statements, but Joseph Mifsud was not charged with making false statements. Mifsud allegedly told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

Mueller says he won't comment on internal deliberations.

As Jordan pushes harder on the Steele dossier and suggests Mueller was selectively charging people, Muller says, “I’m not sure I agree with your characterizations.”

Internal deliberations

9:53 a.m. July 24, 2019: Mueller says he cannot discuss internal Justice Department deliberations when he is asked by Rep. Martha Roby, R-Alabama, about his discussions with Attorney General William Barr concerning the investigation.

The Steele dossier

9:49 a.m. July 24, 2019: Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, asks about the origins of the Steele dossier. Mueller answers by saying that information was “outside of my purview.”

He said the DOJ was already investigating the dossier when his investigation began.

Strzok and Page

9:43 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, asks Mueller if he knew if FBI agent Peter Strzok hated Trump before he hired him for the investigation team. He said he did not, but said he “acted swiftly” when he did find out about it. Gohmert asks if he knew Strzok was having an affair with Lisa Page. Mueller said he became aware of it eventually.

Strzok and Page exchanged negative emails about Trump’s candidacy during the 2016 election season.

Sessions and un-recusal

9:30 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, asked Mueller about former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation.

Cohen: ""Your investigation found at some point after your appointment the President, quote, called Sessions at his home and asked if he would un-recuse himself. Is it not true?""

Mueller: ""It's true.""

Cohen: ""It wasn't the first time the president asked sessions to un-recuse himself, was it?""

Mueller: ""I know of two occasions.""

Cohen went on to ask Mueller if the attorney general is supposed to act as ""the attorney general of the United States of America or a consigliere for the President?""

""The United States of America,"" Mueller responded.

Jason Chaffetz is tweeting

Does obstruction equal jail time?

9:15 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asks if substantial jail time would be the result of a conviction of obstruction of justice.

Mueller says, yes it would.

Presumption of innocence ignored

Who did the Russians want to win

9 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, asked Mueller if the Russians wanted a specific person to win the presidential election if so, she said, which one. “It would be Trump,” Mueller said.

Collins asks about collusion

8:56 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Doug Collins, R-Georgia, the ranking member of the committee, asks for the difference between the terms collusion and conspiracy. He notes that the report uses the term collusion and that it suggested conspiracy.

Nadler’s questions

8:50 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Nadler asks Mueller if Trump refused to be interviewed. Mueller says the president did not sit down for an interview, despite negotiations to get him to do so.

Mueller confirmed that his office went back and forth with Trump’s team for months over an interview that never took place.

At the end of his opening statements, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller outlined the limits of his testimony before the committee.

Muller's opening statement

8:45 a.m ET July 24, 2019: Mueller offers his opening statement and repeats that he told his staff that their work would be done ""quietly and with integrity.""

Mueller says he told staffers they must work “fairly and with absolute integrity.”

He says he did not find any evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and the Russians.

He said he would not suggest that Trump be charged with obstruction of justice because of DOJ guidelines and because of ""fairness.""

He explains why his testimony will be limited – ongoing investigations and DOJ procedures.

He says he is unable to discuss the Steele dossier and the origins of the investigation – questions Republicans were expected to ask.

“We did not address ‘collusion,’ which is not a legal term,” Mueller said. “Rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not.”

The hearing begins

8:30 a.m. ET July 24, 2019: Judiciary Committee hearing begins with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, committee chairman, praising Mueller and his work. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, begins with saying ""the president knew he was innocent"" throughout the investigation.

"EPA: Deal between Calif., 4 automakers to reduce emissions, improve mileage a ‘PR stunt’",https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/07/epa-deal-between-calif-4-automakers-to-reduce-emissions-improve-mileage-a-pr-stunt.html,"A spokesperson with the Environmental Protection Agency is calling a deal between California and four automakers to increase gas mileage and emissions standards a “PR stunt.”

Michael Abboud made the comments to the Associated Press after the deal was announced Thursday, July 25. This comes as the Trump administration reportedly moves on plans to set a single federal standard for fuel economy ratings and greenhouse gas emissions.

A.P. reports California made a deal with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 percent year-over-year from 2022 to 2026 model years. There are “at least” a dozen other states that follow the state’s rules when it comes to these standards.

The Trump administration has bounced around the idea of freezing the standards for each in 2021. Those in favor of this freeze believe it will stop new car prices from rising due to the cost of fuel-saving technology.

Judd Deere, an EPA spokesperson, told the news organization that the Trump administration plans to move forward in taking the state’s rights away when it comes to setting the standard. He told A.P. that the federal government, not a single state should set the standards.

I applaud these four auto companies for reaching an agreement that is good for our workers, manufacturers, and suppliers. This agreement will help reduce carbon emissions, promote innovation, and benefit consumers.https://t.co/CfcjFLtKwb — Sen. Debbie Stabenow (@SenStabenow) July 25, 2019

“Few issues are more pressing than climate change, a global threat that endangers our lives and livelihoods,” Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. ""California, a coalition of states, and these automakers are leading the way on smart policies that make the air cleaner and safer for us all.

“I now call on the rest of the auto industry to join us, and for the Trump administration to adopt this pragmatic compromise instead of pursuing its regressive rule change. It’s the right thing for our economy, our people and our planet.”

A.P. reports that the involved automakers view this deal as an insurance policy to provide some certainty no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election. The news organization quotes a person who requested not to be identified due to the negotiations not being made public.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group that represents a dozen automakers, said in a statement that the announced deal is “not attainable and needs to be adjusted”

This is just more proof that no matter how hard the Trump Administration tries to pull us backward, we'll keep moving forward. https://t.co/bR3Zi040xd — Rep. Mike Levin (@RepMikeLevin) July 25, 2019

“Uncertainty from protracted litigation is a major concern for an industry with long production cycles, so much capital investment and 10 million Americans dependent on auto paychecks,” the group writes in the statement. ""Individual companies may have different perspectives on how best to achieve greater certainty.

“A final federal rule regarding future CAFE/GHG standards has yet to be released and automakers continue to seek an optimal pathway forward that meets the diverse needs of our customers while providing environmental improvements, preserving safety and auto jobs and keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans.”"
US: Unlicensed Bitcoin Exchange Operator Indicted by Justice Department,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Tom Gilchrist']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-unlicensed-bitcoin-exchange-operator-indicted-by-justice-department,"William Green, a 46-year-old New Jersey resident, was indicted by a federal grand jury on account of allegedly running an unlicensed money transmission service. The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."
DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"
Supreme Court clears way for Trump to use Defense Dept. funds for border wall,https://fox59.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://fox59.com/2019/07/26/supreme-court-clears-way-for-trump-to-use-defense-dept-funds-for-border-wall/,"WASHINGTON D.C. (CNN) — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct parts of a wall along the southwestern border that the government argues is necessary to protect national security.

The decision allows the Defense Department money to be spent now while a court battle plays out over whether the government had the authority to divert funds that were not appropriated for the wall. The Supreme Court voted 5-4, along ideological lines, to allow the funds to be used while the court appeals proceed.

In a brief order, the court said that it was ruling in favor of the Trump administration before the litigation has played out because the government had made a “sufficient showing” that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.

Three members of the liberal wing of the court — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — wrote they would have blocked the funds for now. The fourth member, Justice Stephen Breyer, wrote separately to say that he would have allowed the government to use the funds to finalize the terms for contractors but block the funds from being used for the actual construction.

The Supreme Court’s order is a significant win for Trump, who is likely to use the construction of a wall as a major talking point on the campaign trail. The President celebrated the decision in a tweet Friday evening.

“The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed,” the President tweeted. “Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!”

The decision overrules a lower court decision that had blocked the transfer of funds while appeals played out. A panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to allow the use of the funds earlier in the month, holding that the challengers were likely to prevail in their case because the use of the funds “violates the constitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.”

The order comes after Trump ended a 35-day government shutdown in February when Congress gave him $1.4 billion in wall funding, far less than he had sought. He subsequently declared a national emergency to get money from other government accounts to construct sections of the wall.

The $2.5 billion had been shifted from various programs including personnel and recruiting, Minuteman III and air launch cruise missiles, E-3 aircraft upgrades and the Afghan security forces training fund. The Pentagon said it was able to move that money due to uncovered cost savings as part of a process known as “reprogramming.” The money was moved into a Defense Department counter-drug account that is authorized to spend money on the construction of border barriers.

Many lawmakers slammed the decision to move the money away from those national security priorities, threatening to strip the Pentagon of its ability to move money around, something the Defense Department has acknowledged would be detrimental.

Lawyers for the government had asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis and unblock the use of the funds while legal challenges proceed in the lower courts.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco noted in court papers that the projects needed to start because the funds at issue “will no longer remain available for obligation after the fiscal year ends on September 30, 2019.” He said that the funds are necessary to permit the construction of more than 100 miles of fencing in areas the government has identified as “drug-smuggling corridors” where it has seized “thousands of pounds of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine” in recent years.

“Respondents’ interests in hiking, birdwatching, and fishing in designated drug-smuggling corridors do not outweigh the harm to the public from halting the government’s efforts to construct barriers to stanch the flow of illegal narcotics across the southern border,” Francisco argued in the papers, regarding the challenge from environmental groups.

It is a loss for critics, including the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition that argued the administration had illegally transferred the funds after Congress denied requests for more money to construct the wall. The groups argued the wall — in areas in Arizona, California and New Mexico — would harm the environment.

The ACLU, representing the groups, argued in court papers against a stay of the lower court ruling fearful of the wall’s impact on border communities.

“Issuance of a stay that would permit Defendants to immediately spend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with the tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public interest,”ACLU lawyers told the court.

The ACLU slammed the decision after it was released Friday evening.

“This is not over. We will be asking the federal appeals court to expedite the ongoing appeals proceeding to halt the irreversible and imminent damage from Trump’s border wall. Border communities, the environment, and our Constitution’s separation of powers will be permanently harmed should Trump get away with pillaging military funds for a xenophobic border wall Congress denied,” said Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project."

LEADING THE DAY





CONGRESS: The House officially fled Washington last night after lawmakers passed the bipartisan deal to raise the spending caps and the debt ceiling for two years. The bill will now go to the Senate, which will take it up next week before adjourning for its August recess.

The House passed the package, which boosts government spending by $320 billion over the next two years, by a 284-149 vote. Sixty-five House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyWashington gives up on spending cuts The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Overnight Health Care: Senate panel advances drug pricing bill amid GOP blowback | House panel grills Juul executives | Trump gives boost to state drug import plans | Officials say new migrant kids' shelter to remain open but empty MORE (R-Calif.), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseThe Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Carbon tax shows new signs of life in Congress On The Money: House passes sweeping budget, debt limit deal | Dem court filing defends powers to get Trump's NY tax returns | Debt collectors to pay M to settle consumer bureau charges MORE (R-La.) and Rep.

The package would suspend the debt limit through July 2021 and increase spending caps for the next two years. The United States would be on track to add an estimated $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade when compared with the billions in automatic spending cuts that would have kicked in as a result of the 2011 Budget Control Act.

While most conservatives voted against the bill, they never made a concerted effort to press the president to oppose it.

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





2020 POLITICS: Biden is no longer holding his fire at rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination after taking heat for months as he readies for the second Democratic debates next week.

As Jonathan Easley and Amie Parnes report, the former vice president has been absorbing shots from Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker on everything from his opposition to “Medicare for All” to his record on race with little to no pushback, leaving his allies frustrated by the passive approach.

However, the sustained questions about his commitment to civil rights seemed to finally provoke Biden to action, with his latest missives against Booker’s record on incarcerations and criminal justice during his tenure as Newark, N.J., mayor serving as the most recent example. The former vice president also said that he would not be as “polite” with Harris at the next debate after their back-and-forth on busing in late June, describing her attacks as a crass political play and wholly disingenuous.

Underlining the attacks is the continued push by Biden and others for support from African American voters and the former vice president’s need to rebound from an underwhelming debate performance last month in Miami to reestablish him as the undisputed front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nod.

“You can't be called the architect of mass incarceration and remain quiet,” a Biden ally said. “That's cruel and personal. That goes against his entire career. You can't let people say bullshit and not respond to it.”

According to Politico’s Laura Barrón-Lopez, Heather Caygle and Jake Sherman:

“ ‘There is not one person of color — black or brown, that I’m aware of — at any position of authority or decision making in the DCCC,’ said Rep.

“And Fudge isn’t alone.

They charged Bustos of being tactless when challenged by lawmakers of color.

“‘The overall plan for Latino outreach seems to be some 1980s playbook, which doesn't work anymore,’ Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said.

“The DCCC declined to make Bustos available for an interview but said that the ‘DCCC has continued to increase diversity amongst our staff.’

A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Barr says Mueller asked DOJ to send letter limiting testimony to ‘boundaries' of report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-mueller-asked-doj-to-send-him-letter-saying-testimony-must-remain-within-boundaries-of-report,"Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team who asked the Justice Department to send Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""within the boundaries"" of the public version of his Russia probe report.

The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s highly anticipated hearing, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” Asked by Fox News why the Monday letter was sent, Barr said Mueller’s staff asked the department for guidance ahead of the hearing.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS MUELLER HIS HOUSE TESTIMONY 'MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES' OF PUBLIC REPORT

“At his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that,” Barr said in an interview. “And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position and they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them [what] our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance that they requested.""

Asked directly if it was Mueller who asked for the letter, Barr replied, “Yes.”

The letter, obtained by Fox News on Monday, was signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

The letter said, “Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ‘not go beyond,’ the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

Speaking to Fox News, Barr also hit back at Nadler, who during a CNN interview Tuesday called the letter “incredibly arrogant” for trying to “instruct” Mueller what to say.

“He was misinformed as to the facts,” Barr said.

The attorney general also declined to comment on the Democratic-controlled House holding him and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over questions having to do with the Trump administration’s proposed citizenship question to the 2020 census.

“Goes with the territory these days,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, Mueller is expected to testify in public before the House Judiciary Committee for two hours or more, followed by another two hours-plus of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Mueller, meanwhile, also has asked that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and his top aide on the Russia investigation, accompany him at the witness table during Wednesday's hearing.

Republicans are opposed to the request. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary panel's top Republican, called the move an ""apparent stunt"" by Democrats. He said it ""shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.""

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation – in May, when he signaled his disinterest in testifying, saying, “There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

Still, Democrats – as some in the party push to impeach President Trump – subpoenaed Mueller to testify.

During his press conference in May, Mueller said there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. But he declined to reach a conclusion over whether the president took steps to obstruct his investigation – something Democrats are expected to focus their questions on Wednesday.
