MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell apologizes for unverified Trump-Russia report: 'We are retracting the story',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-lawrence-odonnell-apologizes-retracts-story,"MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell kicked off his show Wednesday night by apologizing for running an unverified report that directly tied President Trump's finances to Russia, which he retracted.

""Last night on this show, I discussed information that wasn't ready for reporting,"" O'Donnell said. ""I repeated statements a single source told me about the president's finances and loan documents with Deutsche Bank saying 'if true'-- as I discussed the information-- was simply not good enough. I did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source. Had it gone through that process, I would not have been permitted to report it. I should not have said it on-air or post it on Twitter. I was wrong to do so.""

WHITE HOUSE SLAMS MSNBC FOR UNVERIFIED REPORT, SAYS LEFT-WING OUTLETS HAVE 'WEAPONIZED' THE MEDIA

He went on to acknowledge the letter he and NBCUniversal received by Trump's legal counsel demanding a retraction and an apology for the ""aforementioned false and defamatory"" reporting and threated to take legal action.

""This afternoon, attorneys for the president sent us a letter asserting the story is false. They also demanded a retraction. Tonight, we are retracting the story,"" O'Donnell continued. ""We don't know whether the information is inaccurate. The fact is we do know it wasn't ready for broadcast and for that I apologize.""

On Tuesday night, O’Donnell and fellow far-left MSNBC host Rachel Maddow discussed how Trump was “able to obtain loans when no one else would loan him any money” when he tossed out the unverified speculation.

“I may have some information, in this next hour, which would add a great deal to their understanding of that, if true, and I’ll be discussing it here,” O’Donnell said. ""I stress ‘if true,’ because this is a single source who has told me that Deutsche Bank obtained tax returns… this single source close to Deutsche Bank has told me that Donald Trump’s loan documents there show that he has co-signers. That’s how he was able to obtain those loans and that the co-signers are Russian oligarchs.""

A stunned Maddow leaned back in her chair and responded, “What? Really?”

O’Donnell added “that would explain every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin” if his information is accurate.

The ""Last Word"" host and MSNBC were widely panned by critics for running the story, calling it ""grossly irresponsible."" The White House blasted the report, pointing to ""left-wing outlets"" that have ""weaponized the media.

“This is one of the reasons that a majority of Americans have lost trust in the media. Instead of applying ethics and standards to their reporting, journalists and left-wing outlets have weaponized the media, using it to attack and harass people with little to no regard for the truth,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News.

O'Donnell took to Twitter earlier in the day and walked back the report, referring to it as an ""error in judgment.""

Trump officials say children of some service members overseas will not get automatic citizenship,https://thehill.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/459190-trump-officials-say-children-of-us-service-members-overseas-will-not,"The Trump administration said Wednesday that the children of some U.S. military members and government employees working overseas will no longer automatically be considered United States citizens.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a policy that in some cases rescinds previous guidance stating that children of U.S. service members and other government employees abroad are considered “residing in the United States” and automatically given citizenship under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

USCIS issued a clarification to the rule later Wednesday, explaining that the new rule would only affect three categories of people: Children of non-U.S. citizens adopted by U.S. citizen government employees or service members; children of non-U.S. citizen government employees or service members who were naturalized after the child's birth; and children of U.S. citizens who do not meet residency requirements.

The policy guidance issued Wednesday stated that USCIS “no longer considers children of U.S. government employees and U.S. armed forces members residing outside the United States as ‘residing in the United States’ for purposes of acquiring citizenship under INA 320.”

The rollout of the new rule quickly sparked widespread confusion, leading some to believe that many more individuals would be affected than in actuality.

“This kind of memo is the sort of thing that you don’t put out to the general public without a very bold-faced letter executive summary saying ‘Here’s what this does not do,’” said Bradley Moss, a lawyer with expertise in national security.

“This changes nothing if you are a child born overseas to two U.S. citizens on a military base or just overseas in general – you are fine as a matter of law … you are still considered a U.S. citizen so long as one of your parents had been a physical resident within the United States,"" he added.

Moss said that the pool of individuals who would be affected would likely be small.

The thrust of the memo, Moss surmised, is to prevent individuals who are either adopting a child born overseas to non-U.S. citizen parents or people who have little connection to the United States from “shoehorn[ing] their way into citizenship.”

Acting director of USCIS Ken Cuccinelli wrote on Twitter Wednesday evening that people were “freaking out over nothing,” describing the document as a “highly technical policy memo” used by career employees at the agency.

“This policy update does not affect who is born a U.S. citizen, period. This only affects children who were born outside the United States and were not U.S. citizens. This does NOT impact birthright citizenship,"" he said in a statement later released by USCIS.

""This policy update does not deny citizenship to the children of US government employees or members of the military born abroad. This policy aligns USCIS’ process with the Department of State’s procedure, that’s it.”

The new guidance will not apply to children who acquire citizenship at birth or while residing in the United States, the USCIS notice states. That includes children born abroad to U.S. citizens who have resided in the United States at some point in the past five years.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said in a statement to The Hill that the estimated impact of the change is ""small"" but that the Defense Department is working to provide further clarity for military families.

""DoD has been working closely with our colleagues as DHS/USCIS regarding recent policy changes and understands the estimated impact of this particular change is small. However, we are committed to ensuring affected families are provided the appropriate information, resources, and support during this transition,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason said.

""Further information is available at the USCIS Military Resource Page, Military One Source, and via Service Legal Assistance branches as needed.""

The new policy is aimed at children seeking to acquire citizenship through what is known as the derivation process, a fast-track to citizenship for children of U.S. citizens.

To derive citizenship, children must fulfill a residency requirement. Under previous regulations, living in a home abroad with their U.S. citizen parents fulfilled that requirement; the new rule will require that residence to be on U.S. soil.

These children will now need to apply for citizenship under Section 322 of the INA, which considers them as born and residing outside the United States. That provision requires them to apply for naturalization, which must be completed before the child turns 18.

The new policy will take effect Oct. 29, according to the USCIS notice.

The policy change triggered immediate backlash from Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates.

“This move by the administration will make it harder for Americans serving our country overseas to have families,” wrote Rep. Val Demings Valdez (Val) Venita DemingsTrump takes post-Mueller victory lap Trump attorney: 'Case is closed' after Mueller testimony Mueller agrees lies by Trump officials impeded his investigation MORE (D-Fla.). “This also appears to be an initial step towards ending birthright citizenship, something which the president has threatened to do—and which would be unconstitutional.""

A USCIS official told The Hill that the policy is being updated ""because it conflicts with the definition of 'residence' in the INA and also with INA 322(d), which was enacted in 2008 after this policy was instituted and refers to children who are residing abroad with members of the armed forces of the United States as 'residing outside of the United States.'""

""In addition, the current policy conflicts with the Department of State guidance. Having conflicting policies can lead to inconsistent decisions on citizenship claims by USCIS and the Department of State and can cause confusion as to the date children of U.S. service members and government employees stationed abroad become U.S. citizens,"" the official added.

Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."
US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."
"Italian opposition PD, 5-Star say they want to form coalition led by Conte",https://www.reuters.com,"['Giselda Vagnoni', 'Min Read']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics/italy-inches-closer-to-new-government-as-parties-haggle-idUSKCN1VI0MC?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the opposition Democratic Party (PD) said on Wednesday they would try to form a coalition, setting aside years of hostility to avert a snap election and ease economic uncertainty.

Following days of often tense and difficult talks, the leaders of 5-Star and the PD told Italy’s president that the new government should once again be led by the outgoing prime minister Giuseppe Conte.

The two sides still need to agree on a shared policy platform and team of ministers, but 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio and his PD counterpart Nicola Zingaretti said they had pledged to find common ground for the good of the country.

“We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this experience,” Zingaretti told reporters. Speaking shortly afterwards, Di Maio said: “We made commitments to the Italians...and come what may we want to fulfill them.”

President Sergio Mattarella summoned Conte for talks on Thursday at 9.30 a.m. (0730 GMT), and was widely expected to hand him a fresh mandate.

(graphic: here)

The previous coalition made up of 5-Star and the far-right League collapsed this month when League leader Matteo Salvini withdrew from the alliance hoping to trigger an early election and cash in on his surging popularity.

But his move backfired when Conte refused to resign immediately, giving 5-Star and the PD time to try to overcome their fierce mutual animosity and agree to a government that had previously appeared impossible.

“The only thing that unites them is their hatred of the League,” Salvini said bitterly after meeting President Sergio Mattarella in an effort to convince him to call elections.

“Millions of Italians are being held hostage by a hundred parliamentarians who are looking to cling onto their posts.”

The prospect of a new administration led by Conte, an academic who is considered close to the 5-Star, has buoyed markets, which are betting that Italy will get a fiscally prudent government that will avoid confrontation with Europe.

The League is highly euroskeptic and had promised swingeing tax cuts for 2020 that economists warned could put unsustainable pressure on Italy’s towering debt mountain.

Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell to a record low below 1%, two-year bond yields fell to their lowest since May 2018 at -0.22% IT2YT=RR and Italy’s 50-year bond yield fell to a record low around 2.266% IT50YT=RR.

HURDLES AHEAD

However, a coalition pact is not yet a done deal. The tentative accord could still unravel with 5-Star and the PD yet to agree on other top government posts, besides the prime minister’s position, or reveal a common policy platform.

Unexpectedly, the founder of the 5-Star Beppe Grillo issued a statement late on Wednesday saying the ministers should be technocrats and not elected politicians — a suggestion that is unlikely to gain traction with the PD.

In an added complication, 5-Star has said it will put any deal with the PD to an online vote of its members. Many 5-Star supporters have taken to social media to denounce a pact with the center-left and a ‘yes’ vote cannot be taken for granted.

As negotiations went down to the wire, one of the posts still in play was that of deputy prime minister. The PD wants this job for one of its own, now that it has agreed to Conte staying on as prime minister.

“The problem is that if there is a premier from the 5-Star it is fair that his deputy is from the PD,” PD deputy leader Andrea Orlando said on Twitter.

Conte, a virtually unknown lawyer when he was chosen by the League and 5-Star to lead their new government last year, was seen as a voice of reason within the outgoing coalition and has good relations with Mattarella.

An opinion poll in daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday showed Salvini’s approval rating had plunged by 15 points since he pulled the plug on the government, and is now 16 points behind Conte’s."

It's been eight months since President Donald Trump's first secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, handed in his resignation.

Now the retired four-star general has written his first book, co-authored by former Marine Bing West. Spoiler alert: Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead is not, as the title might suggest, a tell-all exposé of Mattis' tense tenure at the helm of the Pentagon with Trump as commander in chief.

""I'm old fashioned,"" Mattis writes. ""I don't write about sitting presidents.""

Mattis mentions Trump by name only four times, all in the prologue's first two pages — each instance taking place prior to the president's taking office. That said, he does imply criticism, without directly taking shots.

""All Americans need to recognize that our democracy is an experiment and one that can be reversed,"" Mattis writes. ""We all know that we are better than our current politics.""

Mattis' maddening refusal to offer direct thoughts about Trump does not apply to past commanders in chief. His war stories — from liberating Kuwait to invading Afghanistan to battling insurgents in Iraq — are also a refighting of old battles with officers and others whose wartime guidance he portrays as deferring more to presidential whims than to theater-of-war realities.

Enjoying his perch as a visiting scholar at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Mattis never expected Trump to offer him the Pentagon's top job. ""I figured that my strong support of NATO and my dismissal of the use of torture on prisoners would have the President-elect looking for another candidate,"" he writes. But when Trump, who had never met Mattis before interviewing him for the job, called him ""the real deal"" and asked that he join his Cabinet, the self-described political independent agreed on the spot. ""In my view, when the President asks you to do something, you don't play Hamlet on the wall, wringing your hands.""

Trump may have believed he was hiring a latter-day Gen. George C. Patton, a made-for-TV war hero the president-elect would repeatedly refer to as ""Mad Dog."" (That moniker, which Mattis abhors, goes unmentioned in his book.) Instead, what Trump got was the seasoned, well-read and thoughtful warrior-scholar who penned this memoir, the only Cabinet member who failed to laud his boss in front of TV cameras at the president's first full staff meeting.

""I did as well as I could for as long as I could,"" Mattis writes. He left about halfway into what he expected to be a four-year tenure. ""When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution.""

Mattis informs us this book has been in the works since he previously parted ways with his former commander in chief, Barack Obama. In that episode, he was fired in late 2012 as head of the U.S. Central Command.

Call Sign Chaos is ostensibly part of the well-trodden genre of leaders keen to share their insights on what it takes to lead. ""My purpose in writing this book, is to convey the lessons I learned for those who might benefit, whether in the military or in civilian life,"" Mattis writes.

And the book, indeed, is chockablock with insights and aphorisms about what it takes to be a good leader. It begins with a death-scraping tumble down a steep, icy ridge in Mattis' home state of Washington when he was 20. Alone and badly battered, he refused a stranger's offer for a lift home, opting instead to camp by himself for a couple of days and nurse his wounds. That fall, and his proud insistence on recovering alone, would be, as he writes, ""a metaphor for my subsequent career in the Marines: You make mistakes, or life knocks you down; either way, you get up and get on with it. You deal with life. You don't whine about it.""

Or perhaps you write about it. Chapter by chapter, Mattis takes us through a steady rise through the ranks of the U.S. Marine Corps, an ascent he self-deprecatingly finds inexplicable. ""Every time I made a mistake — and I made many,"" he writes, ""the Marines promoted me."" Mattis tells us very little about his personal life. There is nary a word, for example, about this lifelong bachelor's broken engagement to a woman who could not countenance a life of constant relocations with a man dedicated to an often lethal job. He does disclose that as a ""mediocre student with a partying attitude"" at Central Washington State College in 1968, he served time in a local jail on weekends as punishment for underage drinking. There he met another inmate:

""One Saturday night he saw me hoisting myself up to look out the barred window, eager to see what I was missing outside. "" 'What do you see, Jimmy?' he said, lying back on his bunk. "" 'A muddy parking lot.' "" 'From down here, I see stars in the night sky,' he said. 'It's your choice. You can look at stars or mud.' ""He was in jail, but his spirit wasn't.""

""You don't always control your circumstances,"" Mattis concludes about his jailhouse epiphany, ""but you can always control your response."" His book is a compendium of circumstances often beyond his control. What makes it a compelling read is how this warrior-monk dealt with and learned from the jams he found himself in. His call sign, CHAOS, irreverently bestowed by a more junior Marine officer, is an acronym: Does the ""Colonel Have Another Outstanding Solution?""

The 1991 Gulf War was Mattis' first battlefield experience. It would become his touchstone for how a winning war should be waged. As ""the least astute battalion commander in the Marine Corps,"" Mattis trained his charges — ""my young wolves"" — for battle in the desert of Southern California and the peaks of the Sierra Nevada farther north. ""Each week,"" he writes, ""the blade got sharper. ... My intent was to rehearse until we could improvise on the battlefield like a jazzman in New Orleans."" Relocated to the Saudi desert, Mattis would walk the lines after dark, chatting with his charges and learning their state of mind. ""Troops will tell you things when they're on guard duty at night.""

Despite leading his troops into an ambush at one point after three days with almost no rest, Mattis took part in a clear victory: The U.S. chased the Iraqi army out of Kuwait during 100 hours of ground combat. ""In my military judgment,"" he writes, ""President George H.W. Bush knew how to end a war on our own terms. ... He approved of deploying overwhelming forces to compel the enemy's withdrawal or swiftly end the war."" And, in a clear dig at Bush's successors, Mattis added that Bush ""avoided sophomoric decisions like imposing a ceiling on the number of troops or setting a date when we would have to stop fighting or leave.""

A decade later, Mattis was itching to avenge the Sept. 11 attacks, but landlocked Afghanistan was not a place where the Marines — a maritime expeditionary force — could be expected to make a forced entry by sea. Still, he convinced his superiors that he could fly 4,000 Marines through 400 miles of Pakistani airspace separating Afghanistan and the Arabian Sea to a remote airstrip near Kandahar. ""It never entered my mind that we might fail,"" Mattis writes. ""Marines don't know how to spell the word. ... Our lads were ready for the brawl.""

But Mattis' forced entry into Afghanistan soon had him clashing with Gen. Tommy Franks, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan. He writes bitterly of being told by Franks to hold his troops back from going after Osama bin Laden in the al-Qaida leader's mountain hideout of Tora Bora. Rather than blaming President George W. Bush for not sending in the Marines, Mattis faulted himself for failing to ""build understanding up the chain of command"" of how his forces might have prevented bin Laden's escape.

Mattis' thoughts on Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq a year later were another matter. ""Invading Iraq stunned me,"" Mattis writes. ""Why were we fighting them again?"" Toppling the Iraqi army, which Mattis compares to ""a tall, dead tree,"" was the easy part. Left unclear, he writes, was what would happen after that. ""I had no specific policy guidance.""

The chafing by Mattis against his superiors is sharpest in his account of trying to seize Fallujah after four Americans were hanged and burned there by Sunni insurgents. With his forces poised outside the city for street-to-street combat, Mattis received the order to desist. Bush had decided to have American commanders work with local leaders to create an all-Iraqi security force for Fallujah. ""I believe the President's goal was idealistic and tragically mistaken,"" Mattis writes, ""based on misguided assessments that appeared impervious to my reporting.""

Much of the general's pushback is over restrictive rules of engagement that made little sense to him. ""There are some jerks in the world that need to be shot,"" he says he told his ""lads"" patrolling Anbar province. ""Be polite, be professional — but have a plan to kill everyone you meet.""

The book reprises other unbridled comments by Mattis. ""You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,"" he recalls telling an audience of sailors, Marines and civilian contractors in San Diego in 2003. ""You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually, it's quite fun to fight them. It's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.""

The remark was widely reported and criticized. ""Frankly, I was surprised and found their comments bizarre,"" Mattis writes of his critics. ""I never moderated my words or apologized. Knowing our enemies also read my words, I wanted them to know that America had troops who were not tormented about fighting people who murder in the name of religion or deny human rights to others.""

Mattis was investigated in 2004 by a U.S. military team for possible murder charges after he ordered an airstrike on what he says was an al-Qaida team that had crossed from Syria into Iraq. His team's account of killing 26 insurgents had been contradicted by the Guardian, which published a report alleging ""that women and children had been the ones killed, because the gathering was actually a wedding party."" The official investigation concluded the airstrike Mattis ordered had in fact hit a war camp, and he was not charged. ""But by then it was too late,"" he laments. ""The initial false reports had become ground truth; correcting it was not considered news. We had once again lost the battle of the narrative.""

No administration catches more flak in this book than that headed by Obama. In a chapter titled ""Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory,"" Mattis describes a losing battle as head of the U.S. Central Command (appointed by Obama in 2010) to keep a contingent of 18,000 troops in Iraq. ""Beginning with President Bush and continuing through the Obama administration, the White House was set on a total troop withdrawal, for political reasons,"" he writes. ""The National Security staff put no stock in our forecast that if we pulled out, the enemy would resurrect.""

A visit to Iraq by Vice President Joe Biden in the summer of 2010 gets mixed reviews from Mattis. He quotes a teasing question Biden put to him there. ""Know why you're at CENTCOM?"" Biden asks him. ""Because no one else was dumb enough to take the job.""

Mattis writes he found Biden ""an admirable and amiable man"" and liked him. But the vice president was not to be swayed. ""He didn't want to hear more; he wanted our forces out of Iraq. Whatever path led there fastest, he favored,"" Mattis writes. ""He exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly.""

When Obama announced in 2011 that U.S. troops were being withdrawn from Iraq, his assertion that ""we're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq"" rankled his military commander for the region. ""The words 'sovereign, stable and self-reliant' had never been used by the Pentagon or the State Department,"" Mattis writes, ""and I had never seen them in any intelligence report."" Rhetoric, he concludes acidly, ""doesn't end conflicts.""

Obama's efforts to end the U.S. fighting in Afghanistan fare no better in Mattis' account. He notes that while Obama had ""however reluctantly"" sent an additional 30,000 U.S. forces there in 2010, the president had also promised those troops would begin to come home after 18 months. ""My thought was that 'exiting' a war was a by-product of winning that war,"" Mattis writes. ""Unless you want to lose, you don't tell an enemy when you are done fighting, and you don't set an exit unrelated to the situation on the ground.""

Things went downhill from there. At a 2011 meeting with then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's Defense Policy Board, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger asks Mattis what the larger strategy is behind the Pentagon's force deployments. ""I don't know what our integrated strategy is,"" Mattis recalls responding, ""or specifically what it is for my region."" That earned him a chewing out from a ""high-ranking DOD official."" Mattis says he ignored the scolding. ""It had become too clear that I was supposed to sit quietly in the back of the bus as it careened off a strategic cliff.""

Mattis also clashed with the Obama administration over its insistence on wanting ""human rights to be the singular criterion for our foreign policy,"" a stance that put Washington at odds with nations Mattis considered key allies, among them Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. ""The Arab monarchies and strongman leaders were not reforming at the pace our human rights idealists insisted upon,"" Mattis writes. ""But those nations that had stood by us after 9/11 had records far better than those of hostile, oppressive regimes like Iran and Syria.""

It was Mattis' enduring enmity toward Iran that abruptly ended his tenure as CENTCOM commander. He criticizes the Obama administration's failure to respond more forcefully to a 2011 failed plot to bomb a Georgetown restaurant where Saudi Arabia's ambassador would be dining. While Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, publicly pointed at Iran's Quds force as being behind the plot, ""we treated an act of war as a law enforcement violation,"" Mattis fumes, ""jailing the low-level courier.""

Late in 2012, Mattis writes, ""I received an unauthorized phone call telling me in an hour, the Pentagon would be announcing my relief."" He did not go gladly. ""I was leaving a region aflame and in disarray,"" he writes. ""The lack of an integrated regional strategy has left us adrift, and our friends confused.""

We will possibly have to wait for another administration before learning Mattis' thoughts about his 23 months as Trump's defense secretary. But he lets some of those views slip toward the end of his book. ""Nations with allies thrive, and those without wither,"" he writes. ""A polemicist's role is not sufficient for a leader; strategic acumen must incorporate a fundamental respect for other nations that have stood with us as trouble loomed.""

A parting shot? Perhaps. Mattis clearly has another book to write that many will be eager to read."
More than 130 US firms request licences to sell to Huawei,https://www.aljazeera.com,[],,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/130-firms-request-licences-sell-huawei-190828013316563.html,"The United States Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell US goods to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, three sources said, nearly two months after President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed.

But the Trump administration has not yet granted any licences for sales to the blacklisted company, said the people familiar with the process, who spoke to the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity.

The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the US-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on licence applications to sell to Huawei, the world's top producer of telecoms equipment.

That has raised the spectre of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei's US supply chain.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official.

Last week, Trump promised to raise tariffs on $550bn in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75bn in US goods. He then softened his tone towards China at the G7 leaders' meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world's two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.

The current number of licence applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.

A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: ""The interagency process, weighing licence requests concerning Huawei and its non-US affiliates, is currently ongoing.""

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the US to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called ""unjust treatment.""

Huawei, the world's number 2 smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of US national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of US goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licences, which must overcome tough scrutiny.

The US says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G mobile phone networks. Huawei denies the allegations.

Trump promise

Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that US companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by US chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11bn on US components from US firms such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Micron Technology last year.

Government officials urged US companies to apply for licences following Trump's pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.

One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.

But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general licence, which gives US companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei's existing handsets and networks.

Derek Scissors a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in US-China trade talks could spur licence approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.

The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.

According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licence requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.

However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.

The US has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated US sanctions on Iran.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on US bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company's Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand US-China trade deal."
"New Government Takes Shape in Italy, Sidelining Salvini and the Hard Right",https://www.nytimes.com,['Jason Horowitz'],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/world/europe/italy-government-salvini.html,"ROME — Italy’s warring political parties struck a deal late Wednesday to form a new government that shunted aside Matteo Salvini, the hard-right leader who dominated the country’s politics for more than a year and threatened to drastically reorient Italy’s place in Europe.

The sudden turnabout in Italy’s politics just a week after the country’s nationalist-populist coalition collapsed was a relief to the European establishment after 14 months of euroskeptic provocations, anti-migrant crackdowns and flouting of the bloc’s financial rules.

The leaders of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, which is poised to return from the opposition, both said on Wednesday that they had overcome bitter differences and agreed that the outgoing prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, should be prime minister again.

Mr. Conte will meet with President Sergio Mattarella, who is responsible with guiding the country through a political crisis, early Thursday morning, when he is expected to be formally handed the mandate to form a government."
"Gen. Mattis shoots, quite effectively, across Trump’s bow",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/gen-mattis-shoots-quite-effectively-across-trumps-bow,"A few key sentences from a Wall Street Journal piece by Gen. Jim Mattis, the former secretary of defense, serve as a not-so-veiled, but oh-so-important, warning to and about President Trump.

If Trump won’t listen, the rest of us should both listen and act responsibly to find a reasonable alternative to reelecting this president.

Mattis’ essay, an adapted excerpt from a forthcoming book, makes an impassioned case against unilateralism of the sort Trump practices.

“Nations with allies thrive, and those without them wither,” Mattis writes. “Alone, America cannot protect our people and our economy. At this time, we can see storm clouds gathering. … A leader must display strategic acumen that incorporates respect for those nations that have stood with us when trouble loomed. Returning to a strategic stance that includes the interests of as many nations as we can make common cause with, we can better deal with this imperfect world we occupy together. Absent this, we will occupy an increasingly lonely position, one that puts us at increasing risk.”

Contrast that with the abominable isolation of Trump at last weekend’s G-7 summit, where he unpopularly and wrongly carried water for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, ignored other leaders’ pleas to back off his trade war with China, defended North Korea’s recent missile tests, and in general acted like the caricature of the “Ugly American” brought to quite unwelcome life.

Likewise, Mattis offered concerns about our civic culture: “Currently our own commons seems to be breaking apart. What concerns me most as a military man is not our external adversaries; it is our internal divisiveness. We are dividing into hostile tribes cheering against each other, fueled by emotion and a mutual disdain that jeopardizes our future, instead of rediscovering our common ground and finding solutions. ... We all know that we’re better than our current politics. Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our [American constitutional] experiment.”

Obviously, Trump feeds this harmful tribalism, not by mistake but with relish.

What is most disturbing, though, is that Mattis is writing books and columns rather than still serving at the Pentagon. His essay included one brief nod as to why that happened.

“When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign,” Mattis wrote.

This is a delicate way of putting it. The reality is that Mattis resigned because Trump announced, with virtually no consultation, that he would snatch defeat away from one of the most impressive victories in the history of the United States military by withdrawing the small but lethal contingent of American troops from Syria, just as the Islamic State was being wiped out.

Trump subsequently reconsidered after Mattis already had resigned, but Trump’s on-again/off-again commitment to the effort has left our Kurdish allies in the lurch.

While Trump likes to claim he eradicated ISIS, the truth is that ISIS is now reconstituting because Trump took the boot off the throat. Meanwhile, as the Kurds are overwhelmed with a crisis of 60,000 enraged jihadis/ISIS supporters (wives and children and other relatives of the fighters) penned up in porous “camps” in eastern Syria, the biggest victors in the rest of that country are the brutal dictator Bashar Assad and his backer, Putin.

Jim Mattis was one of the most effective generals and defense secretaries in U.S. history. For him to be writing instead of leading is a sign of an inept, unstable presidency.

Marines, Mattis wrote, “expect you to have done your homework, to have mastered your profession. Amateur performance is anathema.” Diplomatically and militarily, unfortunately, our current administration is dangerously amateurish."
The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump returns after travelling to the AMVETS convention in Kentucky, at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S. August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Tasos Katopodis

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
Can Trump force U.S. companies out of China?,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Rachel Layne'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-force-u-s-companies-out-of-china-not-technically-but-he-can-make-it-very-hard-to-stay/,"The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 would give President Trump discretion to impose restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in China if he declared an emergency.

The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.



Although Congress could intervene to block Mr. Trump from declaring an emergency, it would be unlikely to do so given the ongoing partisan conflict in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump startled investors last week when he took to Twitter and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. companies to stop doing business in China as the countries continue to clash over trade. So is he within his rights?

The answer, experts say, is probably so. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a more than 40-year-old law Mr. Trump later cited in another tweet, gives the executive branch broad powers that, if invoked, could make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China.

Passed by Congress in 1977, IEEPA authorizes the president — after a national emergency is declared — to ""investigate, regulate or prohibit"" a range of activities by U.S. companies engaged in global commerce. Those include foreign exchange transactions, banking payments or transfers, and the import or export of foreign currency and securities. The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.

IEEPA is ""an extraordinarily broad and open-ended delegation from Congress to the president,"" Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and Hoover Institute fellow, said in a tweet. As of earlier this year, U.S. presidents had invoked the act more than 50 times since its initial passage, according to the Congressional Research Service.

CBS News poll: U.S. consumers concerned about China tariffs

More recently, Mr. Trump in May invoked IEEPA in placing restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. He also threatened to use it to impose tariffs on Mexico tied to immigration. The difference now is that Mr. Trump is threatening to use IEEPA, which is typically used for sanctions, as a cudgel in his administration's trade war with China.

Mr. Trump's threat to block U.S. companies from doing business in China ""would face no effective legal barrier,"" Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said in a research note. The White House could also expect backing from the courts, which have tended to uphold even broad exercises of power under IEEPA, Goldsmith said in another tweet.

The White House has since walked back Mr. Trump's order that U.S. companies cut ties with China amid protest from the business community. But he could still brandish IEEPA down the road if the conflict continues to deteriorate.

""So in theory that law exists, but that's not what the president said. He is asking American companies to take a look, take a fresh look at frankly moving out of China, go in someplace else,"" Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Trump gets ready to ""double down"" on trade war with China

So what's to stop Mr. Trump from using IEEPA to push U.S. companies around in an unending series of national emergencies? In a word, Congress, which is constitutionally mandated to regulate commerce with foreign countries and which could vote to end a national emergency.

The problem there is that Congress would likely need a two-thirds majority to end a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service. Partisan conflict in Washington would make that a tall task, giving Mr. Trump more room to exercise his power under IEEPA."
David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."

Mauricio Macri calls Urgent Cabinet Meeting amid Monetary Instability

Buenos Aires, Aug 28 (Prensa Latina) In the midst of another hard day for the Argentine economy, in which the US dollar again rose to reach 58 pesos for each greenback, President Mauricio Macri called an urgent cabinet meeting.

According to local media, Macri met with his cabinet at the Casa Rosada to evaluate the situation and take other measures to cushion the financial blow of the falling Argentine peso since last year.



The Argentine cabinet meeting was attended by the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Marcos Peña, Buenos Aires Governor María Eugenia Vidal, the new Minister of the Treasury, Hernán Lacunza, and the President of the Central Bank, Guido Sandleris.



On Tuesday, the US dollar rose again generating greater market volatility. The so-called 'country risk' also increased to over 2,000 points, while Argentine shares on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed once again.



According to several media, in the meeting Macri envisaged drawing up an 'institutional response' to the impact on financial markets.

Donald Trump Jr. Campaigns for Dr. Greg Murphy,https://www.witn.com,[],,,,https://www.witn.com/content/news/Donald-Trump-Jr-Campaigns-for-Dr-Greg-Murphy-558631081.html,"Donald Trump Jr. was in New Bern Monday night to campaign for 3rd District Congressional candidate Republican Dr. Greg Murphy.

Trump Jr. said, ""We win this seat, we use it, we keep going forward and win North Carolina in 2020, we're gonna win the presidency.""

Trump Jr. was sounding confident as he spoke to the crowd of supporters gathered at the private campaign event for Murphy.

Murphy says, ""It's great to have the executive branch supporting those of us who are going to be in the legislative branch.""

The campaign stop is one of two Trump Jr. and conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle made in North Carolina Wednesday, both for congressional candidates. The first stop was in Charlotte.

Guilfoyle says, ""We want to make sure that we have winners that are going to support the president and stand shoulder to shoulder with the president.""

The visit to eastern Carolina comes less than two weeks before election day for the 3rd Congressional District seat.

Voters are choosing between Murphy, Democrat Allen Thomas and two third party candidates, to replace the late Congressman, Republican Walter Jones.

Murphy says, ""You know, It's a low turnout, that's what a special election is, but I think folks have really responded to our message.""

Trump Jr. is urging voters to head to the polls and get their friends to do the same, as early voting continues for another week. He says, ""Make sure you turn up. When you do, we win and winning is so much better than losing, right?""

Those who aren't registered to vote in this special election can still do so if you vote early. You will have to bring an ID and a bill with your name and address on in to register. Early voting will continue until September 6th when polls close at 7:00 p.m.

Election day is September 10th.

Report: U.K. Seeks Suspension of Parliament Before Brexit,https://time.com,['Stuart Biggs'],,,,https://time.com/5663167/uk-brexit-queen-prorogue-parliament/,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is preparing to ask Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue or suspend the U.K. Parliament from September until mid-October, the BBC reported, a move that could hamper lawmakers’ efforts to block a no-deal Brexit and even trigger a constitutional crisis.

The pound fell as much as 0.7%.

Under the plan, all business would be suspended from about Sept. 11 until a Queen’s speech on Oct. 14 kicks off a new session of Parliament, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter. Downing Street called it business as usual for a new government, she said, with the “useful political side effect” of denying time to MPs trying to stop Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.

The prime minister’s office had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Parliament is due to return from summer recess on Sept. 3.

Members of Parliament who oppose a no-deal Brexit have feared Johnson would attempt to stop them meeting, and won’t take it lying down. Some have talked of simply continuing to meet in another building, and defying the government. Parliament has also passed measures aimed at forcing the government to let it meet.

“This is an unconstitutional and undemocratic outrage not seen in recent British history,’’ Labour MP Stephen Doughty said on Twitter. “Pulls HM the Queen into major political crisis. Did Cabinet know or approve? How can a tiny meeting of just three be allowed to shut down our democracy? This will not stand.’’

The BBC also reported the Cabinet would hold a conference call on Wednesday morning.

Venezuela’s Guaidó names shadow cabinet to help oust Maduro,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Scott Smith', 'August At Pm']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelas-guaido-names-a-shadow-cabinet-to-oust-maduro/2019/08/28/7ab98f1c-c9c0-11e9-9615-8f1a32962e04_story.html,"Venezuela’s National Assembly President Juan Guaido speaks during an extraordinary session to discuss the country’s humanitarian crisis in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019. (Ariana Cubillos/Associated Press)

CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó named a new shadow cabinet on Wednesday, launching the latest phase of his campaign aimed at forcing President Nicolás Maduro from power.

The new team — including heavyweight opposition figures Leopoldo López and Julio Borges — will be dedicated to preparing for a transitional government and new elections, said Guaidó, who claimed presidential powers in late January as head of the National Assembly, saying Maduro’s election last year was a fraud.

Guaidó has since gained support from more than 50 nations, named several foreign ambassadors to represent him abroad and appointed a board to oversee U.S.-based Citgo refineries, Venezuela’s most valuable foreign asset.

But the opposition leader has yet to wrest power from Maduro after seven months of trying.

Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, a geopolitical risk analyst who teaches at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said Guaidó’s so-called interim government functions more tangibly outside of Venezuela than at home.

“The shadow cabinet is relevant, however, in terms of shoring up domestic belief that the transition continues — despite its painfully drawn-out timeline,” Lansberg-Rodriguez said. “Any movement signals advancement to a certain extent.”

Guaidó said he’s calling on his political mentor López to serve as general coordinator, though López has lived in the Spanish ambassador’s home in Caracas for protection since launching a failed military uprising with Guaidó on April 30.

Opposition lawmaker Borges, who lives in exile in Colombia, will oversee Guaidó’s foreign relations, and other members of his team will deal with economic development, asset recovery and human rights.

For his part, Maduro rejects Guaidó as a puppet of the U.S. government, which he says is bent on exploiting Venezuela’s vast oil wealth. Despite the South American country’s deepening crisis, the socialist leader remains in office with support from the Venezuelan military and nations including Cuba, Russia, China and Turkey.

The National Wildlife Federation and Sustainable Furnishings Council ranked the country's 90 leading retailers on their wood sourcing practices, compiling the data into an online scorecard. With the annual scorecard, the Federation aims to encourage furniture retailers, big or small, to implement robust policies that drive responsible wood sourcing practices through their complex supply chains.

Top retailers included Cisco Home, ABC Carpet and Home, Ikea, and Williams-Sonoma.

""One thing to remember is that 65% of furniture in North America comes through independent retailers, not the chains,” the National Wildlife Federation's Barbara Bramble. “So that's why we've made the list of companies we score a wide variety.""

Responsible wood sourcing is good for business, says the Federation. According to a poll by the Sustainable Furnishings Council, more than 80 percent of consumers surveyed said they are interested in buying furniture made from wood harvested from well-managed forests. Bramble said since the scorecard was developed last year, many companies already have made improvements.

""The scores, even the top category for several companies, went up this year. And, a number of companies who were in the very low-scoring basket have raised their scores as well,” she said. “So, I think this scorecard is catching their attention.""

Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."

""Moreover, I have to get some former Cabinet officials in unity to speak up about it. They know it's a crisis,"" he added. Scaramucci did not provide any names of people associated with the coalition he said he is assembling, but predicted that by ""middle to late fall"" there will be a ""trove"" of people willing to speak out against Trump.

Last week, Scaramucci announced he no longer supports Trump's reelection bid and that the top of the 2020 Republican presidential ticket may need to be replaced. During his ""New Day"" appearance on Monday, Scaramucci said that if more Republicans begin publicly opposing Trump, it would jumpstart a ""process"" that could eventually replace Trump on the GOP ticket.

Trump, in an apparent response to Scaramucci's ""New Day"" interview, labeled his former aide a ""nut job"" on Twitter and said he ""barely knew him,"" even though he hired him as communications director and Scaramucci frequently defended him on television.

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

[Trump retaliates in trade war by demanding companies cut ties with China ]

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

[‘Protectionist bullying’: China denounces Trump administration’s latest tariff hikes ]

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)

The Department of Homeland Security plans to divert $271 million in emergency funds to detain and deport illegal immigrants, the agency announced Tuesday.

The emergency funds, $155 million of which will come out of FEMA’s disaster-relief pot, will go towards providing more ICE detention beds and covering other costs related to the detention of illegal immigrants.

“Without additional funding for single adult detention beds and transportation from the U.S. Border Patrol to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention facilities, ICE will not be able to support the influx of migrants from U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehensions,” DHS said in a statement on Tuesday.

The diversion comes roughly two months after Congress refused to fund additional ICE detention beds as part of a $4.6 billion emergency funding package designed to address the migrant crisis at the southern border.

Congressional Democrats have objected to the administration’s unilateral reallocation of funds, arguing that the executive branch is encroaching on Congress’s power of the purse.

“Once again, DHS has ignored the negotiated agreement with Congress by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (D., Calif.), the Homeland Security Subcommittee chairwoman.

DHS plans to use the funds to add nearly 7,000 ICE detention beds, which will allow the agency to detain more migrants while their asylum claims are being adjudicated, rather than releasing them in the hope that they will return for their hearings.

Critics have also pointed out that the move will detract from FEMA’s resources just as the hurricane season is beginning. Tropical storm Dorian was approaching Puerto Rico as the announcement was made."

President Trump speaks at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Monday. (Markus Schreiber/AP)

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. He is an emeritus professor of constitutional law at American University’s Washington College of Law.

President Trump thinks he has found the perfect site for the 2020 Group of Seven summit: the Trump National Doral golf resort. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it,” he said from this year’s G-7 gathering in France.

His choice wasn’t exactly astonishing, considering that since he took office, Trump has visited his business properties at taxpayer expense 362 times; there have been 630 visits to Trump properties by at least 250 Trump administration officials, including White House staff members, Cabinet members and agency employees; and visits to Trump properties have been made by 111 officials representing 65 foreign governments, all according to a report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

[Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.]

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

[Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.]

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."
Nadler to probe Trump's G-7 resort pitch,https://thehill.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/459187-nadler-to-probe-trump-proposal-to-host-2020-g-7-summit-at-trump-owned-property,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerPoll: Majority wants Trump out, but not through impeachment Second Democrat representing Trump district backs impeachment GOP memo deflects some gun questions to 'violence from the left' MORE (D-N.Y.) announced Wednesday his panel will broaden its investigation into President Trump Donald John TrumpOur justice system must reward success Former Biden economic adviser: 'I really like a lot of' Warren's tax proposals Roy Moore calls for Omar to go back from 'whence she came' MORE to include his proposal to hold the 2020 Group of Seven (G-7) summit at one of his family-owned properties in Florida.

Nadler said the president's pitch to host next year's meeting of world leaders at Trump National Doral Miami is ""only the latest in a troubling pattern of corruption and self-dealing by the President"" and may violate both the foreign and domestic Emoluments Clauses.

""The President’s personal financial interests are clearly shaping decisions about official U.S. government activities, and this is precisely the type of risk that the Constitution’s Emoluments Clauses were intended to prevent,"" Nadler said in a statement.

""More importantly, the Doral decision reflects perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay President Trump’s private businesses in order to conduct business with the United States,"" Nadler added.

Trump has publicly defended his resort as top contender for the next G-7 meeting, calling it a “natural” location because of its proximity to a major airport.

“Doral happens to be within Miami. It’s a city, it’s a wonderful place. It’s a very, very successful area of Florida,"" Trump told reporters at a press conference Monday at the conclusion of this year's G-7 summit, held in Biarritz, France. ""It’s very importantly only five minutes from the airport – the airport is right next door. It’s a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world.""

The president has insisted he was not trying to boost his own properties.

""With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like such a natural,"" Trump said. ""Each country can have their own villa or their own bungalow, and they have a lot of units in them, so I think it just works out well.""

The Emoluments Clause bars presidents from accepting gifts or other benefits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval.

Foreign and domestic government officials have frequently stayed at Trump-owned hotels and properties, prompting critics to argue Trump is benefitting financially from his role as president while in office.

Nadler, who is already leading a sprawling investigation examining allegations of obstruction of justice, public corruption and other abuses of power, said the Doral probe would be wrapped into the broader one.

""The Constitution demands that President Trump’s private interests and official conduct remain separate, and this latest announcement demands scrutiny by Congress,"" Nadler said.

""Potential violations of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution are of significant interest and grave concern to the Committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment,"" he added. ""The Committee will broaden its ongoing investigation to include these latest revelations and will take further investigative steps, including scheduling hearings and requesting additional documents from the White House.""

Nadler's announcement comes as the White House has blocked both current and former officials from testifying before congressional committees, arguing that under the standard of immunity, confidentiality protections offered to the executive branch apply to current and former aides, effectively preventing them from disclosing what took place during their time in the administration.

The White House would likely follow a similar track if Nadler sought to subpoena administration officials over his property proposal."

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

"The executive branch's job is to enforce laws, not make them",https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/457996-the-executive-branchs-job-is-to-enforce-laws-not-make-them,"The Trump administration unveiled two controversial sets of regulations last week. One narrows the eligibility criteria for legal immigrant status. The other eases protections for threatened and endangered species. Both policies face legal challenges.

People can legitimately debate whether these rules make sense as a matter of policy and politics. The environmental regulations arguably do more to protect big business than animal species, while the new immigration regulations make it even harder for migrants to remain in the United States legally.

As a personal matter, judges might like or dislike these outcomes. But as a professional matter, some judges believe that, under the Constitution, only Congress has the express power to make laws — not agencies that answer to the president. These judges tend to be ideologically conservative. Will that crowd join progressives to criticize the new regulations, albeit for different reasons?

ADVERTISEMENT

Not likely.

The argument against agency lawmaking was articulated most recently by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He wrote the dissenting opinion in Gundy v. United States, a case involving lawmaking by the attorney general regarding the national sex offender registry. Gorsuch eloquently argued that lawmaking power belongs to Congress, and for good reason. Unlike career bureaucrats within the executive branch, Congress is democratically accountable to the people if they wind up making bad laws. Executive branch officials are supposed enforce the law, not create it. This is because — with the exception of the president — the people get no say in hiring and firing those in the executive branch.

To be sure, President Trump Donald John TrumpOur justice system must reward success Former Biden economic adviser: 'I really like a lot of' Warren's tax proposals Roy Moore calls for Omar to go back from 'whence she came' MORE campaigned on aggressive elimination of federal regulations — which is a longstanding GOP objective — and has held to this promise. Proponents of deregulation argue that the federal administrative bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and that regulation of free markets is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. Everyone does better if the markets are allowed to function unimpeded by bureaucrats who wind up blocking progress and innovation.

That’s a fine position to take, of course — so long as what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. The problem with the conservative argument against lawmaking by agencies is that it’s often — and conveniently — abandoned once an agency does something that conservatives like politically.

Department of Commerce v. New York involved lawmaking by the Department of Commerce regarding the contents of the U.S. Census form. The Constitution gives the power to implement the Census to Congress — not the president. Congress handed that power off to the secretary of Commerce in a statute called the Census Act. Although this is what Congress did in the statute challenged in Gundy — to Gorsuch’s chagrin — he said nary a peep about the hand-off of legislative power in the Census Act.

ADVERTISEMENT

Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Either delegation of lawmaking power by Congress to the executive branch is constitutionally acceptable or it is not.

One might argue that deregulation is taking regulations off the books, so it doesn’t involve lawmaking, and is less constitutionally objectionable. But that’s not what the Trump administration’s environmental and immigration regulations do. They make new laws.

Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act. It provides that “the Secretary shall by regulation . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species.” That language is the “hand-off” of legislative power from Congress to the secretary of the Department of Commerce, whom today happens to be Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossHillicon Valley: Court delays ruling against Qualcomm | Google asks employees not to talk politics at work | Facebook releases early emails discussing Cambridge Analytica | Bannon to release anti-Huawei film Bannon to release anti-Huawei film 'Claws of the Red Dragon' Trump administration announces deal to avert tariffs on Mexican tomatoes MORE.

The statute then gives Ross a bunch of factors to use in deciding whether a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization of the species for commercial or other purposes, disease or predation, inadequate regulations or “other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.”

The agency’s regulations add new factors to this list, including the requirement that a threatened species must become endangered “within the foreseeable future.” For that determination, the agency must now consider factors like “threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability.”

The immigration regulations are no less constitutionally objectionable. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the secretary of Homeland Security the power to “establish . . . regulations” to implement the statute. (Again, that’s the “hand-off.”) The statute also states that “any alien who . . . is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible,” and provides a list of factors for use in deciding if someone is a “public charge,” including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills.

Once again, the agency’s new regulations add new factors to this list, defining “public charge” to also capture “any alien who receives one or more public benefits,” including federally-funded benefits such as housing assistance and Medicaid.

Handing off legislative power to agencies is not considered unconstitutional under current Supreme Court case law, and there are good reasons for tolerating the practice.

But if conservative judges are going to complain about them, they should do so across-the-board. The leaders of the agencies involved in these rulemakings were never on the ballot for the offices they hold. Voters who don’t like these laws cannot go to the polls and fire them. This is precisely why Gorsuch and other conservative judges have balked at lawmaking by agencies. It messes with the separation of powers.

The question for conservatives is this: If either of these laws were to reach the Supreme Court, would Gorsuch kvetch that this particular lawmaking by executive branch agencies is constitutionally objectionable? Or would he stay silent — as in the Census case — leaving us to wonder whether his constitutional purity is contingent on conservative ideology and politics?

Because if it’s the latter, then we might have politicians on the Supreme Court after all.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)

Taking their cue from red states that regularly banded together to sue the Obama administration, Democratic attorneys general began challenging the Trump administration in court the first month President Trump took office, starting with the travel ban.

The litigation by coalition has continued unabated, with at least six multistate lawsuits filed against Trump policies in August alone, most prominently against the president’s attempt to deny green cards and visa extensions to foreign nationals seeking public assistance.

Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."
"Nigeria's Buhari assigns cabinet portfolios, appoints new oil minister",https://www.reuters.com,"['Felix Onuah', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-politics/nigerias-buhari-assigns-cabinet-portfolios-appoints-new-oil-minister-idUSKCN1VB1F9,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa’s top producer of crude oil.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari poses with his new cabinet for a photo, after a swearing-in ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria, August 21, 2019. Nigeria Presidency/Handout via REUTERS

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country’s main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria’s emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

“The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,” Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country’s ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

“We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February’s election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party’s base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

“There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,” said Liewerscheidt."

U.S. officials have sought migration deals with Central American governments as they aim to fulfill U.S. President Donald Trump’s pledge to curb migrant flows.

Speaking alongside Bukele in San Salvador, McAleenan praised his host’s efforts in reducing migration, saying the number of Salvadoran migrants reaching the United States’ southern border was on pace to drop 60% since Bukele took office in June.

“The United States has already seen significant progress from your efforts,” McAleenan said, addressing the Salvadoran president.

Under threat of sanctions, Guatemala agreed late last month to be designated as a “safe third country,” meaning Hondurans and Salvadorans would be required to seek refuge in Guatemala, rather than proceeding north.

McAleenan suggested that such an agreement would not make sense with El Salvador, which has seen less migration in recent months than Guatemala and is less frequently traversed by U.S.-bound migrants from other countries.

“We’re going to meet our partners where they are,” said McAleenan, who arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday. “Some of that will involve asylum cooperation agreements.... But in other countries we’re not going to need that type of partnership, it will be more operational or capacity building.”

The letter of intent signed by McAleenan and El Salvador’s minister of justice and security calls for heightened collaboration between law enforcement, including more sharing of information such as biometric data, as well as boosting economic development in El Salvador.

Officials also discussed expanding Salvadorans’ access to work visas in the United States, Bukele said.

Before leaving El Salvador on Friday, McAleenan will visit a joint law enforcement training center, tour a migration center and meet with human rights groups and business leaders, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement."
Trump is either trolling everyone or thinks he's like a god,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/politics/erratic-trump-god-complex/index.html,"(CNN) There's been a change in President Donald Trump . He used to say he had accomplished more than any other President, a debatable claim. But now he's using messianic language about himself .

That was after he quoted a conspiracy theorist who described him, literally, as being like the King of Israel and said Jews ""love him like the second coming of God"" - -- also known as the Messiah.

Then Trump joked in front of a group of veterans about giving himself the Medal of Honor -- an award that recognizes the highest levels of military valor.

The Times wasn't arguing that the idea of buying Greenland was a bad one but that Trump's decision to go diplomatically nuclear with Denmark -- a tiny country that has been a steady military ally -- over a perceived slight involving a real estate offer that wasn't even officially made is surreal.

And that's the point. Trump's reality -- where countries can be bought and sold and where it's worth spending a day rhetorically fighting Denmark -- is different from other people's.

His amazingly thin skin, his combative foreign policy, his complete rejection of diplomacy, his demand for complete loyalty all come at a very real public cost.

He continues to pursue nuclear talks with a regime run by an infantile strongman with whom he feels he has a good relationship despite most diplomats saying he has enabled anti-US propaganda.

His paranoia about a deep state and a witch hunt out to ruin his presidency has threatened American confidence in the justice system and the intelligence community.

His supreme belief in his negotiating ability has alienated American allies and brought the country into a trade war with China that increasingly threatens the world economy.

His inability to back down led to the longest partial government shutdown in US history.

There's been a historic level of turnover in his Cabinet as he turns hot and cold and then either discards top aides very publicly or is abandoned by them.

And the misstated facts and outright lies he spreads seem to be increasing and not decreasing during his time in the White House. CNN's Daniel Dale counted 84 false claims emitted from the President either by tweet or by mouth last week. That was, according to Dale, a record during the last six weeks. Trump's all-time record came just before the 2018 midterms, so stay tuned for more from Trump as the presidential campaign heats up.

It is not just his inability to use facts, however. Everything becomes about him. Even during his trip to El Paso to comfort the victims of gun violence, he bragged about this size of his rally there months before and criticized the city's mayor as a RINO

Either he's trolling everyone, saying outlandish things to get a rise or, as some psychiatrists viewing him from afar have argued for some time, he may be becoming delusional.

As far as the Constitution is concerned, it might not matter what his mental state is. The mechanism to remove a President from office for unfitness is the 25th Amendment, which requires a mutiny of his Cabinet, large portions of which aren't filled by permanent officials. He's in office and surrounded by people who never publicly disagree with him.

But just because he is President and there's little or no chance he'd ever be removed does not mean there's not cause for concern when he starts sounding like he has a God complex.

His former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired by Trump and was then a surrogate for him, has fully turned on the President and is encouraging fellow Republicans to do the same."

Pray noted that, despite aggressive sales efforts and excellent product and customer service quality, the financial returns of the operation did not meet expectations and upset market conditions were preventing longer-term improvement.

“This is another case of an otherwise healthy American business having to close down due to the continued proliferation of subsidized Chinese cabinets,” said Pray.

SALEM, Oregon (AP) — A white man opens fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, targeting Mexicans and killing 22 people. Another man kills 11 Jewish worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.

The two mass shootings and a presidential tweet put a spotlight on the idea of ""domestic terrorism,"" adding momentum to a debate about whether such attacks should be classified and tried in the same way as crimes against America by foreign extremist groups and their supporters. A Republican senator and a Democrat in the House of Representatives are drafting bills to do that while some Republicans call for a left-wing group to be designated a terrorist organization.

""Domestic terrorism is in our backyard and we need to call it and treat it under the law the same as other forms of terrorism,"" said U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican who intends to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September.

McSally's proposal would allow federal law enforcement to charge suspects with acts of domestic terror and add punishments for those crimes, including the death penalty.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, introduced legislation on Aug. 16 that he says is a ""very high priority.""

""The goal is to put domestic terrorism at the same level of priority as ISIS- or al-Qaida-inspired terrorism, since Americans on American soil now are just as likely, if not more likely, to die at the hand of a domestic terrorist motivated by some hateful ideology like white supremacy,"" Schiff said in a telephone interview.

Separately, two Republican senators are calling for an anti-fascist movement known as antifa to be designated as a domestic terrorist organization. The push comes after clashes between white supremacists and antifa in Portland, Oregon, which drew a tweet from President Trump suggesting domestic terrorism designation for antifa but not the white supremacists. Such a designation does not currently exist.

While a push to rethink what should be deemed terrorism gains some momentum, it has sparked concerns about infringement of constitutional rights. It's also not clear whether the debate will be embraced in a bipartisan way, though McSally said this week that her bill has received ""a lot of positive feedback ... from both sides of the aisle.""

Schiff said he hopes for ""bipartisan support for an effort to put the full weight of the federal government behind the prosecution of people committing these hateful acts of domestic mass terror.""

Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is working on ""legal mechanisms"" that would enable domestic terrorist organizations to be treated like those on the State Department's list of foreign extremist groups, his spokeswoman Maria Jeffrey said in an email.

Cruz and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, introduced a resolution on July 18 condemning antifa, and calling for it to be designated as a domestic terrorist organization.

As antifa activists prepared to square off against far-right demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump tweeted that ""major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION of TERROR.'""

Currently, only foreign groups can be labeled terrorist organizations. The U.S. State Department maintains that list , currently comprising 68 groups — none of which is white supremacist. It is a crime for a person in the United States to knowingly provide ""material support or resources"" to a foreign terrorist organization.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said he doesn't believe Congress should enable the executive branch to designate groups as domestic terrorists.

""I wouldn't trust this administration to exercise such power in an unbiased and judicious manner,"" Merkley said.

The Anti-Defamation League says antifa hasn't been accused of any murders, and that there is no comparison between the loosely organized movement and the white supremacist groups it sometimes clashes with. Antifa uses ""unacceptable tactics"" but rejects racism, while white supremacists use more extreme violence to intimidate minorities, the ADL said.

Schiff denounced Trump's tweet as ""a disservice to our efforts to combat domestic mass terror.""

""I see it as the same destructive political posturing we've come to expect from the president, that would argue white supremacists' hate is not the problem, antifa is the problem,"" Schiff said.

Mary McCord, who used to lead the Justice Department's National Security Division, said labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations would infringe on First Amendment rights such as freedom of expression. Instead, she advocates making domestic terrorism a federal crime, which would enable prosecution for providing material support. Such support could include providing funds, a safe haven or weapons.

The most common international terrorism charge is providing material support, accounting for nearly half of federal terrorism-related prosecutions since Sept. 11, 2001, McCord said.

Schiff said his bill would allow the prosecution of providing material support to a domestic terrorist.

Jeanne Theoharis, a political science professor at Brooklyn College who has written several books on civil rights, worries about such a provision.

""What material support does is allow for going after people whose beliefs and associations are well outside the mainstream,"" Theoharis said. ""It provides a way for the government to go after people whose politics they don't like.""

What is the G7? Here's the History of the Conference,https://time.com,['Julia Webster'],,,,https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate.

Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders.

What does G7 stand for?

G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Why was G7 created?

The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy.

France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding.

Which countries are members of the G7?

The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population.

The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.

This would have been Juncker’s last G7, as he is soon to be replaced by his successor, Ursula von der Leyen, following the European elections that took place in May. However, on Monday it was announced that Juncker will not travel to Biarritz for the summit since he needs to continue his recovery after having had emergency surgery at the weekend.

Why was Russia kicked out of the G8?

Russia was kicked out of the then G8 in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which was seen by leaders as a “violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

President Barack Obama and other world leaders announced in a joint statement, titled The Hague Declaration, in March 2014 that they would cancel that year’s planned meeting in Sochi, Russia.

“Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi summit,” the statement said. “We will suspend our participation in the G8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, a few days before his departure for the summit, Donald Trump said Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 group. “I think it’s much more appropriate to have Russia in. It should be the G8 because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,” he said.

Next year it will be the turn of the United States to host the G7.

What’s the difference between G7 and G20?

They have similar names and similar functions. While the G7 mainly has to do with politics, the G20 is a broader group that focuses on the global economy. It’s also known as the “Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy” and represents 80% of global GDP.

It gathers leaders from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union.

Founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, the G20 started off as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. However, as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 was upgraded to head of state level in an inaugural summit in Washington, D.C.

This year’s G20 was chaired by Japan. The 2019 Osaka summit was the 14th meeting of the G20, held on 28-29 June 2019.

Imperial Pacific pays remaining US$10.5 million balance on annual license fee,https://www.asgam.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2019/08/29/imperial-pacific-pays-remaining-us10-5-million-balance-on-annual-license-fee/,"The Commonwealth Casino Commission (CCC) has withdrawn a complaint against Imperial Pacific International (IPI) after the Saipan integrated resort operator paid the outstanding US$10.5 million balance owing on its annual casino license fee.

The regulator issued the original complaint last week upon discovering that IPI had paid only US$5 million of the US$15 million due by the 12 August deadline. It also gave IPI 15 days to pay the balance or risk having its license suspended.

While IPI eventually made the payment – which included an additional US$502,570 Consumer Price Index adjustment – shortly before the 15-day deadline expired, the CCC may still issue a penalty of up to US$50,000 for the delay.

IPI has made no secret in recent times of its need to preserve funds for the completion of Imperial Palace‧Saipa, including the scheduled opening of the first six of 15 VIP suites and villas by 30 September.

The property’s first hotel is due to open by the end of the year, with a second hotel forecast for 30 June 2020 for the second hotel, a VIP gaming area and sky level by 30 September 2020 and Beach Club by 31 December 2020."
