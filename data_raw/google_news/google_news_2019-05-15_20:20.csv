Trump boasts that his looks and brain are better than Biden's,https://www.politico.com,['Katie Galioto'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/15/trump-biden-2020-election-1325071,"President Donald Trump took a shot at 2020 hopeful Joe Biden for his looks and mind, saying his brain is ""much sharper"" than the fellow septuagenarian's. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump boasts that his looks and brain are better than Biden's

President Donald Trump took another dig at former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday, claiming the Democratic primary front-runner’s looks and mind are less sharp due to age.

At 72 and 76, respectively, Trump and Biden are among the oldest candidates seeking the White House in 2020. But the president’s comment came in the form of a tweet responding to “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough’s remark earlier Wednesday that Trump “looks like he’s about 20 years younger than a lot of Democratic candidates.”

“He can engage the audience,” Scarborough said of Trump on the MSNBC morning show. “He can engage viewers, despite the hateful rhetoric, despite everything else. You can see that guy is gearing up for 2020. And yes, Democrats, he’s going to be hard to beat.”

Trump commented on a tweet linking to a Washington Examiner article summing up Scarborough’s comments and wrote: “Thank you Joe and remember, the BRAIN is much sharper also!”

The president has already gleefully touted his age in the early stages of the 2020 primary, comparing himself to the two Democrats he reportedly views as his most likely challengers in the general election — Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is 77. Trump last month called himself “a young, vibrant man” while talking to reporters, claiming Biden and Sanders make him look youthful and energetic.

Trump has reportedly told his aides, however, that he views Biden as his biggest threat in 2020 — perhaps fueling extra insults lobbed at the former vice president. In a speech in Louisiana on Tuesday, the president alleged that Sanders “has a lot more energy than Biden.”

“But it’s energy to get rid of your jobs,” Trump continued during a tangent bashing a slew of the 20-plus Democratic primary candidates. “He’s got the opposite energy that you produce. Not good energy, you don’t like his energy.”

All three white male septuagenarians, though, will likely fight for overlapping segments of voters, competing to win the blue-collar and Rust Belt blocs that helped secure Trump’s victory in 2016. And Biden and Sanders face a young and diverse pool of primary contenders.

Scarborough on Wednesday played a clip of Trump’s diatribe from the prior day.

“Let's be blunt about Donald Trump,” he said. “That guy can do on a campaign stage what nobody else can do.”

The “Morning Joe” host has a complicated relationship with the president. Scarborough and his co-host and wife, Mika Brzezinski, were once friends of Trump but have been deeply critical of him since he entered the White House.

Scarborough is a former congressman and Republican, who announced he was leaving the GOP to become an independent in 2017, stating his personal values clashed with what the party stood for under Trump’s leadership.

The president has often launched attacks at “Morning Joe” from his Twitter account over the course of his campaign and presidency, repeatedly criticizing the show’s ratings and characterizing it as “fake news.”"

But soon, the president's re-election team plans to give away, as part of a fundraising contest, the millionth red “Make America Great Again” hat produced by the campaign since 2015. The campaign had Trump sign it.

INSIDE TRUMP 2020: AS DEM FIELD SETS, CAMPAIGN TAKES AIM AT ‘SOCIALIST ORGANISM WITH 22 HEADS’

“We’re on the verge of selling our millionth hat,” Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, told Fox News during a recent visit to the campaign offices in Northern Virginia.

In a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday, the campaign said anyone who contributed to the campaign that day would be automatically entered in the contest to win the hat. The president, the campaign said, signed the hat at his desk in the White House and plans to present it to the winner at an upcoming rally.

“Your signed red MAGA hat will be personally hand-delivered to you by President Trump himself at a Trump Rally,” the email said. “You’ll also get to take a picture with him!”

Until then, the hat is being held in the campaign office of John Pence, a senior campaign staffer and nephew to Vice President Pence.

The campaign said the million figure only includes official hats sold by the campaign since Trump first announced he was running for president.

“There’s millions more if you count the fraudulent ones that are not official merchandise,” McEnany said."
Opinion | The Fight Over How Trump Fits in With the Other 44 Presidents,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas B. Edsall'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/trump-history-presidents.html,"I raised the question with Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard who wrote the book “How Democracies Die” with his government department colleague Daniel Ziblatt.

Levitsky, responding to my emailed query, wrote:

There may well be something to the claim that Trump’s is a disjunctive presidency representing the end of the Reagan era. But to jump from there to the conclusion that he does not pose a serious threat to democratic institutions strikes me as facile. Such a claim too easily sets aside important contextual differences between this administration and those of other “disjunctive” presidents.

Levitsky provided a long list of contemporary factors that distinguish the Trump presidency from the Hoover and Carter presidencies, including

extreme partisan polarization along overlapping social/cultural/cleavages, the hardening of partisan identities and the rise of intense negative partisanship, the crystallization of white identities and the perception among some white voters of threat in the face of decades of immigration and steps toward racial equality; dramatically higher levels of income inequality and declining social mobility; the weakening of party elites’ gatekeeping capacity, reinforced by the introduction of party primaries, and, in the context of extreme polarization, the erosion of key democratic norms.

Levitsky’s argument goes beyond the overarching political environment to Trump’s character.

Trump “has shown himself,” Levitsky continued,

to be a more openly autocratic figure than any of the other disjunctive president I am aware of. So we have a president with authoritarian instincts in a context of extreme partisan polarization (such that Republicans line up behind Trump no matter what) and weakened norms. That strikes me as quite a bit different — and more threatening — than say, the Carter presidency.

In addition, Trump must be viewed as the avatar not only of an American political phenomenon but a global one.

Levitsky argues that the “disjunctive presidency” theory

lacks any comparative or global perspective. There are changes occurring globally that have unleashed illiberal or populist right wing reactions across much of the industrialized West. Whether it is globalization, migration and ethnic diversification, technological change, or some combination thereof, at least some of the dynamics that are occurring in the US cannot be understood in a vacuum. It would therefore be silly to assume that the context in which we are operating in 2019 is easily comparable to those of 1924-28 or 1976-80.

Ziblatt, Levitsky’s co-author, argued in an email that it is a highly risky proposition to take any comfort in a theoretical construct placing Trump as the endpoint of the Reagan era:

It is very, very dangerous way to feel reassured and to write off the Trump presidency as the final, dying days of the Reagan era. There are certainly analogies to be drawn from earlier eras but it is only an analogy, not a law of history.

Trump stands apart from past presidents in his willingness to capitalize on what Ziblatt identifies as an “existential fear” among voters in the face of broad demographic change:

The huge demographic changes underway in the U.S. since the 1970s have prompted Republican existential fear about the future and an increasingly stiff resistance to democracy itself. Like Conservatives in Europe before 1914 or Southern Democrats in the 1890s, fear of the future means a greater willingness to play dirty and to block the emergence of any “recuperative presidency.”

Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology at Harvard, sharply criticized the Skowronek-Balkin theory because it masks what she contends is a fundamentally different and dangerous moment in American politics:

We are in a very extreme period in U.S. political history because of the radicalization of the GOP and the apparent willingness of virtually all of its officeholders, candidates, and big donors to go along with authoritarian and anti-democratic measures of many kinds, not just presidential power grabs but legislative and judicial steps to curtail voting and organizational rights of opponents, in essence rigging future electoral contests in a very minority rule direction.

Skocpol warned of “mechanistic over-optimism,” writing that “things will look very different if Trump is re-elected, as he may very well be.” The current state of politics “is no ordinary cyclical turn,” she notes. “I would rank this period as one of the most conflictual since the late 1960s and early 1930s and the one with the greatest potential for actual regime change since the Civil War.”

There are some political scientists who generally agree with the Skowronek theory of cyclical regime change but who raise concerns about how well Trump fits into that analytic structure.

Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University, poses a basic question about attempts to place Trump within a repetitive historical context:

We have both a president who is distinct in history and an era in political time that differs from previous ones in important structural ways. This combination points to the limits of history as a clear set of instructions for what might happen next.

In an email, Azari wrote that

the overall dynamics of party competition have changed in part because, for the first time in US history as far as I can tell, race and immigration are sorted between the two parties.

In the case of Trump, Azari points out that

Presidents who violate norms, especially those about the boundaries of their power, tend to be reconstructive presidents who reset the terms of debate and the expectations for the presidency — FDR and Jackson are perhaps the clearest examples of this.

Trump, in this context, is more like a reconstructive president than a disjunctive president:

Trump has also changed the language and, I think to some degree altered the identity and agenda of the Republican Party — and of the Democrats, who are responding to him. Trump has altered how we use political language — we all use adapted Trumpisms all the time, like make X great again or a riff on “build the wall."" He looms large in politics and in culture. This is not a typical disjunctive trajectory.

Azari was a student of Skowronek’s at Yale and believes his cyclical theory of regime change remains “incredibly useful for looking at politics.”

Both Azari and Skowronek acknowledge, however, that something that does not fit the theory of regime change may be taking place in American politics."
"Trump’s puzzling trade war with China, sort of explained",https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/15/18618421/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war,"President Donald Trump’s years-long trade war with China is heating up, and nobody is exactly sure why or when it will end.

Last week, Trump raised an existing 10 percent tax on many Chinese imports to 25 percent when talks originally designed to deescalate the earlier round of trade warring collapsed. China responded by raising its own taxes on many American imports. Then Trump started talking about taxing an even wider range of Chinese products.

Naturally, Trump has tweeted a lot about this. His narrative is that tariffs are good because they force China to pay money to the government (which isn’t true) and that farmers shouldn’t worry about losing access to the Chinese market because he can organize bailouts for them anyway. His own economic policy team, meanwhile, concedes that this is wrong and trade war will cause pain on both sides. Global financial markets agree with Trump’s advisers rather than the president, and stocks fell on the news.

....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been “forgotten” for many years. Their time is now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2019

Trump’s reasoning for the trade war is a bit murky. His list of goals are a mix of concessions that could be considered pro-worker or pro-company. There’s also part of a larger question of the US-China relationship, which China hawks see as too beneficial to Beijing. They’d prefer to team up with other countries against China rather than slap them with tariffs, as Trump has done.

Regardless, the reality is that trade wars are mutually destructive. The only way to really “win” one is to convince the other side that you are dangerously reckless and ignorant of how the global economy works. This seems like a job that Trump is extremely well-suited to, but it also raises the possibility that he is in fact dangerously reckless and ignorant of how the global economy works.

American presidents have gotten wrapped up in trade wars before. The United States and the European Union waged a two-decade trade war about bananas that spanned the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations even though neither the US nor Europe grows bananas. But Trump is escalating the trade war with China with an unusual level of vigor and seeming disregard for the potentially damaging consequences.

Trump’s thinking about China paying the tariffs is wrong

The president likes to argue that tariffs are a kind of direct benefit to the United States because China pays them, so even if the trade war ratchets up, there’s at least an upside.

This is both literally mistaken (American importers pay the tariffs) and a conceptually confused way of thinking about the whole thing. The direct revenue impact of the tariffs just isn’t important.

The big winner from taxing Chinese imports is the people — in America, Vietnam, or wherever else — who make products that compete with Chinese imports.

It’s true that it’s not obvious where the ultimate economic cost falls. On the morning of May 13, Trump tried to cite some research showing that most of the cost falls on Chinese producers by referencing a 2018 study by Benedikt Zoller-Rydzek and Gabriel Felbermayr for EconPol Europe, which argued that a 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports would raise US consumer prices by 4.5 percent, with the rest of the cost being borne by China-based producers.

There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2019

This obviously doesn’t say that the cost of the tariffs is entirely borne by Chinese manufacturers. A 5 percent price increase is less than a 25 percent price increase, but it’s still an increase.

Other studies, meanwhile, are less optimistic. Mary Amiti, Stephen Redding, and David Weinstein find that “the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.”

An important thing to note, however, is the tit-for-tat nature of the trade war. And while Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein find that the cost of Trump’s tariffs has been borne entirely by American consumers, they also find that the cost of China’s retaliation has been borne entirely by Chinese consumers. The Zoller-Rydzek and Felbermayr study doesn’t do this exercise, but the same symmetry principle should operate, with their model indicating that Chinese retaliation was very costly to American producers.

The methodological issues behind this dispute are interesting, but for an ordinary citizen, the symmetry is the most important part. The disagreement is on whether raising trade barriers mostly hurts the country that is raising them or mostly hurts the country that is being targeted. But since in this case both countries are raising trade barriers, there’s no way to escape the conclusion that the conflict is costly. (Though media accounts can end up exaggerating the costs by neglecting some winners.)

The cost of a trade war

If you take an international trade economics class, your professor will probably distinguish between analyzing the cost of tariffs in a small country versus a large country.

In the small country case, which is easier to model, imposing the tariffs affects the domestic price of a good (because of the tax) but doesn’t change the global price (because the taxing country is small).

The US and China are the two largest economies in the world. So we are in the harder-to-model case where imposing a tariff raises domestic prices (because of the tax) but lowers the global price (because the reduction in demand is big enough to move global markets).

This can have some slightly weird results. Chinese moves to block imports of US-grown soybeans, for example, are supposed to hurt the United States. But precisely because it depresses the global price of soybeans, it’s actually good news for everyone who buys soybeans — not just edamame lovers but also farmers who use it as animal feed, food processors who use soy oil, and, ultimately, almost everyone who eats food.

One upshot of this is that the overall cost of the trade war is lower than the impression you’d get from a broad aggregation of trade sob stories. For every consumer sad about higher prices, there’s a producer who’s excited about them. And for every producer who’s sad about lower prices, there’s a consumer who’s happy.

And most of all, the dividing line between who wins and who loses on any given round of tariffs and counter-tariffs has relatively little to do with whether you’re Chinese or American and a lot to do with what your specific role in the global economy is.

In the United States, for example, most people provide locally focused, non-traded services — they work in schools or hospitals or restaurants or retail stores — in which case, they are harmed by Trump’s efforts to punish “China” but actually benefit from China’s efforts to retaliate against the United States.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), speaking on Trump’s behalf to CBS News, argued that ordinary Americans shouldn’t worry too much about the negative impact the trade war is having on their lives because it’s not like dying in an actual war.

""There will be some sacrifice on the part of Americans, I grant you that. But also that sacrifice is pretty minimal compared to the sacrifices that our soldiers make overseas that are fallen heroes or laid to rest,"" @SenTomCotton on trade war with China pic.twitter.com/lqlEZtaeBs — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) May 13, 2019

“It’s not as bad as dying” is a somewhat odd defense of a policy, but Cotton is basically correct that the scale of the overall harm here is pretty modest. Americans will see higher prices for some things. But the kind of things that tariffs raise the price of don’t actually impact the main spending categories — housing, higher education, child care, health care — that burden America’s families.

So if the trade war ends up accomplishing something useful, the fact that it was disruptive along the way may be no big deal. The problem is it’s a bit hard to say what Trump is trying to achieve here.

America’s trade war aims are a little hazy

One of the underlying oddities of the saga is that it’s never been entirely clear what Trump actually wants out of this interaction.

America’s official list of demands contains a bunch of items that are somewhat in tension with each other. The US wants China to:

End “forced technology transfer” policies whereby US companies that want to set up in China end up needing to hand over some technology to Chinese stakeholders. End policies that force American companies that want to set up shop in China to structure their Chinese businesses as joint ventures with Chinese-owned companies. Crack down on industrial espionage against American firms. Halt its policy of subsidizing domestic companies that operate in strategic high-tech sectors that China wants to dominate. Reduce various barriers to American agricultural exports. Commit to reduce the large bilateral trade deficit.

A key thing to note here is that though concern about the loss of manufacturing jobs to China is a key driver of China trade worries among the mass public, several of these demands actually cut in the other direction.

Forced technology transfers, mandatory joint ventures, and the threat of industrial espionage are all key reasons that American firms might want to avoid outsourcing work to Chinese factories. If China relents on these points, it might be a big win for American business but could plausibly accelerate the exodus of manufacturing work to Asia.

Points 5 and 6, on the other hand, are pretty classic jobs-focused trade protectionism. Item 4 has a bit more of the flavor of trade protection but is also clearly focused by similar concerns to points 1 through 3 about wanting to slow the pace of China’s technological progress.

Obviously, Trump’s dream scenario would be for China to simply fold on all points. But in an actual negotiation, you tend to need to settle for half a loaf, and it makes a difference which half you really want. There’s one scenario in which the US and China settle on some handshake deals to narrow the trade deficit via larger Chinese purchases of US agricultural commodities. And there’s another scenario in which the US really drives hard to get China to ease up on technology acquisition. But these two scenarios depend on significantly different characterizations of what the basic complaint is.

In a normal administration, you would expect background briefings with journalists to help substantially clarify how the White House is really thinking about this. But in Trump’s Washington, it’s clear that his own team simply disagrees to an extent with itself, and that the president is playing an ambiguous role in this game.

That’s because Trump, at least, seems to portray himself as thinking that the tariffs are good in and of themselves, whether or not they lead to a deal. One way to see this is that, as Democrats often complain, Trump is not really focusing his trade policy on China.

Instead, he’s simultaneously hitting Korean appliances, Canadian steelmakers, and, potentially, European automakers with separate sets of tariffs. Levying all kinds of tariffs on everyone makes sense if you just love tariffs, but if you’re actually trying to get China to give ground and make a deal, you might want to team up with allies and all crack down on China simultaneously.

On the other hand, if you want to get the Chinese to back down, making them think Trump is just a reckless person who loves tariffs might be a good strategy.

Trump could be employing deliberately confusing strategies

Because a tit-for-tat game of tariffs hurts both the United States and China, the standoff is a bit like a game of chicken.

China would prefer that the United States back down. But if it becomes convinced that the United States won’t back down — possibly because the president has no idea what he’s talking about — then it starts to make sense for China to consider backing down instead.

Back when Barack Obama was president, members of his team sometimes mused that the United States was at a strategic disadvantage in this kind of standoff with China because the People’s Republic’s authoritarian political system made it easier to ride out hardships without consequences for Chinese leaders.

And one account I’ve heard from both current and former senior Trump officials is that Trump — master of the art of the deal — is simply trying to flip this script by acting like he doesn’t know the trade war is harmful.

Then again, Jonathan Swan reported Tuesday morning for Axios that he’s “asked several current and former administration officials whether Trump actually believes that China pays the tariffs — rather than the reality that U.S. importers and consumers do,” and the consensus is that he really does.

I talked to some officials a while back, before the trade war was hot. And if their assessment of the situation is correct, in order for it to work, they’d all need to pretend to believe what they told Swan. But what seems most likely is that different members of Trump’s team simply disagree in their assessment of what’s going on because Trump has said and done contradictory things and because they themselves disagree about the best approach to trade policy.

Trump, meanwhile, has hailed strategies of ambiguity and flexibility in several of his books and much of his 2016 campaign rhetoric. So while the situation is confusing, it’s probably deliberately confusing.

Trump has preserved his options

Whether by design or by blunder, Trump has found himself in a situation where he has a lot of options available to him.

If China doesn’t back down and the US economy continues to be strong despite the moderately harmful tariffs, Trump can claim the economy is strong because of the tariffs and pitch himself as the savior of the Midwestern swing states.

If China offers significant concessions on either major prong of the dispute, Trump can take yes for an answer at any point and claim a major policy victory.

If China doesn’t offer significant concessions and the trade war starts for whatever reason to be a major annoyance, Trump can always settle for minor concessions and enjoy a little stock market euphoria.

Precisely because the trade war is an inherently lose-lose situation, any possible resolution of it is a win. And that, in some sense, is a very nice position for Trump to be in.

Note, however, that the underlying predicate for all this is that the strong US economy gives Trump room to maneuver. Nevertheless, the signature element of Trump-era politics is the reality that his national approval ratings are stuck in the low 40s despite a benign external environment in terms of national security and economic growth.

Parlaying the strong economy into a lot of drama that will eventually allow Trump to claim some kind of victory is extremely Trumpy in the sense that it displays his unquestionable genius for making himself the center of attention at all times. But as is so often the case, one is tempted to ask whether it might not make more sense to try a simpler plan that involved less stirring up of trouble and more just letting people relax and enjoy a period of peace and prosperity."
Mark Cuban says 'nobody' can beat Trump in 2020 'right now': report,https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mark-cuban-nobody-can-beat-trump-in-2020-right-now,"Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban said in an interview Tuesday that he doesn’t think any of the Democratic candidates for president right now can beat President Trump.

""Nobody right now,"" Cuban said when asked which candidate has the best chance of dashing the president's re-election hopes.

“Politicians are the least trusted of every profession,” the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks told CNBC. “If you look at why people voted for Donald Trump, in my opinion, first and foremost it was because he wasn’t a politician.”

Cuban also called the candidates’ campaign proposals “headline porn,” claiming none of the policies would be legislatively viable.

He also admitted he’s considering running for president himself but isn’t planning on it soon.

“It would take the perfect storm for me to do it,” he said.

Vice President Joe Biden is “smart” and “could do a decent job,” Cuban said but confessed that no candidate stands out to him.

Cuban said if he did run it would be as an Independent. He previously mulled running during the 2016 election, claiming he could beat both Hillary Clinton and Trump, according to CNBC.

Opinion | Donald Trump Is Not America,https://www.nytimes.com,['Frank Bruni'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/trump-fourth-of-july.html,"Most of his predecessors did nothing of the kind. They understood that the day belonged to the country, not its leader, and they didn’t conflate the two.

Trump does, all the time, and it’s alternately annoying, confounding and galling. If you’re not thrilling to his vision and submitting to him, you’re possibly guilty of treason — remember that rant? If you’re asking legitimate questions about unholy alliances that he may have forged or conflicts of interest he may possess, you’re orchestrating a coup.

Trumpian logic, more narcissistic than syllogistic, holds that if it’s the president’s job to lift up the country, then it’s the country’s job to lift up the president — spiritually, financially, with appointments for his cronies and sycophants, with jobs for his kin, with applause and of course with parades.

A parade: That’s how this whole impulse to convert the Fourth of July into the Fourth of Trump started, according to reporting by The Washington Post. In Paris, beside President Emmanuel Macron, Trump beheld a Bastille Day procession with all its military hardware, and he wanted the same in Washington, the same for him, tanks in the streets, fighter jets in the air. But that was too financially costly and politically risky, so now this: a tentative plan for a starring role amid the starbursts that less needy and more dignified presidents were content to marvel at, not exploit. For Trump, everything — a national holiday, America itself — is an opportunity for brand enhancement, another tall building on which to slap the letters of his name in gold.

And his response to effacement is hyperbole and swagger: He’s like one of those animals that puffs itself up when predators come around, using illusory might to conceal intrinsic weakness. Is it any accident that in the middle of an escalating feud with congressional Democrats, as the more damning aspects of Robert Mueller’s report sank in and his namesake was served a subpoena by a Republican-led Senate committee, he played host to and praised a loathsome autocrat, Viktor Orban of Hungary; again flaunted his friendship with Vladimir Putin; toughened his talk about Iran; and ratcheted up his trade war with China? For Trump, vulnerability begets a pantomime of super-potency."
"Dispute erupts over whether Brennan, Comey pushed Steele dossier, as DOJ probe into misconduct begins",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dispute-erupts-over-whether-brennan-comey-pushed-steele-dossier-as-doj-probe-into-misconduct-begins,"A high-level dispute over which senior government officials pushed the unverified Steele dossier amid efforts to surveil the Trump campaign has broken out into the open again, after it emerged that Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if the FBI and DOJ's actions were ""lawful and appropriate.""

Sources familiar with the records told Fox News that a late-2016 email chain indicated then-FBI Director James Comey told bureau subordinates that then-CIA Director John Brennan insisted the dossier be included in the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference, known as the ICA.

Fox News was told that the email chain – not yet public -- referred to the dossier as ""crown material,"" but it was not clear why this apparent code was used. On Tuesday night, former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that ""Comey has a better argument than Brennan, based on what I've seen.""

A day earlier, Gowdy told Fox News, ""Whoever is looking into this, tell them to look into emails"" from December 2016 involving Brennan and Comey. Gowdy, who is now a Fox News contributor, said his assessment was based on sensitive Russia records he reviewed as then-chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee.

But in a statement to Fox News, a former CIA official put the blame squarely on Comey.

""Former Director Brennan, along with former [Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper, are the ones who opposed James Comey’s recommendation that the Steele Dossier be included in the intelligence report,"" the official said.

""They opposed this because the dossier was in no way used to develop the ICA,"" the official continued. ""The intelligence analysts didn't include it when they were doing their work because it wasn't corroborated intelligence, therefore it wasn't used and it wasn't included. Brennan and Clapper prevented it from being added into the official assessment. James Comey then decided on his own to brief Trump about the document.""

Fox News has reached out to Comey's legal team twice, and provided the statement from the former CIA official, but did not receive a reply on the record.

In March, Republican Sen. Rand Paul leveled similar allegations on Twitter, citing a ""high-level source"" who said Brennan had ""insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier"" be included in the January 2017 ICA.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ WARNED FBI OF 'BIAS' IN KEY FISA SOURCE -- BUT FBI PRESSED ON

Clapper previously testified that the dossier was not ultimately used in the ICA. News that Comey had briefed Trump personally on the dossier before the inauguration -- purportedly to warn him of potential blackmail threats -- leaked within days and opened the door for media outlets to publicize the dossier's lurid claims.

Whether the FBI acted appropriately in obtaining the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to Trump campaign aide Carter Page is now the subject not only of U.S. Attorney John Durham's new probe, but also the ongoing review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber has been conducting his own investigation separately, although details of his progress were unclear.

As one example, in its FISA application, the bureau repeatedly and incorrectly assured the court in a footnote that it ""does not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion, and instead asserted that the Yahoo article provided an independent basis to believe Steele.

Steele has told a British court that he briefed multiple news organizations during the fall of 2016 -- including Yahoo News.

Gowdy's remarks echoed Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this past weekend that he was pushing to declassify documents that would expose the FBI's poor efforts to corroborate the dossier.



""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Graham said. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham cited a report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was told expressly that Steele, the bureau's confidential informant, had admitted to a State Department contact he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her meeting with Steele on Oct. 11, 2016, was sent to the FBI prior to the bureau's FISA warrant application to monitor Page, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

The US and its allies in Iraq are bracing for attacks as a hidden threat from Iran looms,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Ryan Pickrell'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/state-dept-orders-all-non-emergency-government-personnel-out-of-iraq-2019-5,"The US Department of State sent out a notice Wednesday ordering all non-emergency US government employees to leave Iraq immediately.

Without giving a reason for the partial evacuation, the notice said that employees should ""depart Iraq by commercial transportation as soon as possible"" and ""avoid US facilities within Iraq."" US employees are being pulled out of both the US Embassy in Baghdad and the US Consulate in Erbil.

State provided some additional clarity after the release of the notice, explaining that ""given the increased threat stream we are seeing in Iraq ... the secretary has decided to place Mission Iraq on ordered departure,"" CNN reported.

""These actions are not the prelude to a U.S. attack against Iran,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted. ""There is clear & persistent evidence,supported by observable movements on the ground,that Iran's proxy forces in Iraq and Yemen plan to attack Americans with the intent of inflicting mass casualties.""

""Right now Americans serving us in Iraq are facing a serious & imminent threat,"" he added.

Other lawmakers suggested they are in the dark on this situation. ""The Trump administration has not provided any information to this committee on the intelligence behind their decisions or what they plan to do with Iraq and Iran,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, reportedly said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday.

The Dutch government announced Wednesday that it was suspending a key mission in Iraq due to an unspecified security threat. Germany has decided to suspend military training operations in Iraq in response to a marked increase in regional tensions.

In September, the Trump administration made the decision to pull US government employees out of the US Consulate in Basra, in southern Iraq, after a rocket attack by Shiite militias linked to Iran. The attack did not cause any injuries.

The State Department's latest order comes amid increasing tensions between the US and Iran, which have been on the rise since President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May 2018.

Last week, the US accused Iran of plotting attacks on US interests in the region.

To respond to this threat — details of which have yet to be presented — the US military deployed an aircraft carrier and accompanying strike group, a bomber task force, and other assets to the US Central Command area of responsibility. Bombers have already begun flying deterrence patrols.

The US has warned Iran, which denies the allegations against it, that any attack on US forces or interests will be met with ""unrelenting force."" Trump personally has warned that Iran will ""suffer greatly"" if it targets the US with any act of aggression.

While some observers have suggested the US is marching toward war with Iran, others have stressed that this is not the case. Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute and a former member of the National Security Council, argues that the ""risk of inadvertent conflict and escalation is real.""

""This is [especially] the case given the likely poor understanding each side has of the other's intent and red lines, and the poor communications not just between the US and Iran, but between the US and our allies,"" he added."
"Homeland Security to allow border wall to go through national monument, wildlife refuge",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-to-allow-border-wall-to-go-through-national-monument-wildlife-refuge/,"The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding will come from the Defense Department following the emergency declaration that President Donald Trump signed this year after Congress refused to approve the amount of border wall funding he requested.

Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona.

Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.

""The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,"" said Laiken Jordahl, who works on border issues at the Center for Biological Diversity.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has typically not said much about construction plans.

At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, row after row of cactuses decorate 516 square miles of land that once saw so much drug smuggling that over half the park was closed to the public. But illegal crossings in that area dropped off significantly in the past several years, and the government in 2015 reopened the entire monument for the first time in 12 years.

While Arizona has seen an increase in border crossers over the last year, most are families who turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. The number of drugs that agents seize in the state has also dropped significantly.

But the government is moving forward with more border infrastructure.

The waivers the department issued Tuesday are vague in their description of where and how many miles of fencing will be installed. The Center for Biological Diversity says the plans total about 100 miles of southern border in both Arizona and California, near Calexico and Tecate.

In Arizona, construction will focus on four areas of the border and will include the replacement of waist-high fencing meant to stop cars with 18- to 30-foot barriers that will be more efficient at stopping illegal crossings.

The government has already demolished refuge land in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and construction is set to begin any day. On one section of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, crews have used heavy construction equipment to destroy a mix of trees, including mesquite, mulberry and hackberry. Those trees protect birds during the ongoing nesting season.

According to plans published last year, the cleared land will be filled in and a concrete wall will be installed, with bollards measuring 18 feet installed on top.

After months of public outcry, Congress forbade U.S. Customs and Border Protection from building in the nearby Santa Ana wildlife refuge or the nonprofit National Butterfly Center. But it didn't stop money from going to wall construction in other refuge lands, nor did it stop the government from building in otherwise exempted land due to the emergency declaration, said Marianna Trevino Wright, the butterfly center's director.

""They're going to have to protect us in every single spending bill going forward, and they have to protect us against the state of emergency,"" Wright said. ""And this administration has made it clear ... that they don't want any exemptions."""
Justice Department says FDA ‘lacks jurisdiction’ over death-penalty drugs,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Laurie Mcginley', 'Reporter Covering Health', 'Mark Berman', 'National News Reporter', 'May At Pm', 'Laurie Mcginley Covers Health', 'Medicine For The Washington Post. She Focuses On The Food', 'Drug Administration As Well As Cancer Research', ""Treatment. She Was Previously The Post'S Health"", 'Science']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/justice-department-says-fda-lacks-jurisdiction-over-death-penalty-drugs/2019/05/14/da056e6c-764d-11e9-b7ae-390de4259661_story.html,"The Justice Department says in a new legal opinion that the Food and Drug Administration does not have authority over drugs used in lethal injections, a stance sure to be challenged by death-penalty opponents.

The department’s Office of Legal Counsel said that “articles intended for use in capital punishment by a state or the federal government cannot be regulated as ‘drugs’ or ‘devices.’ ”

The legal opinion, issued this month, comes as states have struggled in recent years to obtain drugs for lethal injections, which remain the country’s primary method of execution even as the number of executions has declined.

In 2015, the FDA blocked Texas from importing shipments of an anesthetic from an overseas distributor, finalizing the decision two years later. The agency argued the importation was illegal because the drug, sodium thiopental, was not approved in the United States and was improperly labeled. It also cited a 2012 federal injunction barring the agency from allowing the drug’s importation.

Texas responded to the FDA’s move by suing the agency in early 2017, claiming the agency was interfering with the state’s responsibility to carry out its law enforcement duties. The lawsuit was filed shortly before President Trump took office. Trump has long been a supporter of capital punishment. while his Senate-confirmed attorneys general — Jeff Sessions, who left the post last year, and William P. Barr, who assumed the job this year — have also backed the practice.

The legal opinion from the Justice Department this month sides against the FDA and with Texas. It says that drugs intended for executions are different from any others, noting that “they exclusively inflict harm” and “are not intended to produce any benefit for the end user.” It expressly highlights “the narrowness of our conclusion,” saying that it does not address whether the FDA “has jurisdiction over drugs intended for use in physician-assisted suicide.”

But it also takes a broad view of the issues at hand, arguing that if the FDA had jurisdiction over drugs meant for executions, it would have similar power over other areas — such as firearms — which the agency has not sought to regulate.

The Justice Department’s opinion is unlikely to have any immediate effect, however, because the FDA is still operating under the 2012 injunction. It is not clear whether the Justice Department will seek to have that injunction lifted, a move that could spark a long legal tussle.

The opinion seems aimed at “giving a green light” to corrections officials to look abroad for drugs needed for executions, said Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University and a death-penalty expert.

“I think this has very broad ramifications, unfortunately,” Denno said in an interview. “This is intended to allow departments of corrections to access drugs outside the country because they’re having so much difficulty doing so.”

While European companies have objected to their products being used in executions, corrections officials could have more luck turning to countries such as China or India, Denno said. “It has the potential to open the floodgates,” she said.

The Texas attorney general’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The legal opinion was issued after a protracted battle between the FDA and the Justice Department over the regulation of lethal injection drugs.

More than a year ago, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had a heated argument in the White House Situation Room, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Sessions wanted the FDA to allow drugs used for executions to enter the country without undergoing agency scrutiny. Gottlieb refused, saying that such a move could undermine the agency’s authority. Gottlieb left the agency in April, six months after Sessions left the Justice Department. Both Sessions and Gottlieb declined to comment.

States’ difficulties in obtaining lethal injection drugs stem from drug companies’ objections to having their products used in executions.

For many years, states relied on a combination of three drugs to carry out death sentences: an anesthetic, such as sodium thiopental; a paralytic; and a product meant to stop inmates’ hearts. But Hospira, maker of sodium thiopental, said in 2011 that it would stop manufacturing the product, a decision the company attributed to its use in executions.

In the years that followed, states began turning to new combinations and execution protocols. Nebraska last year became the first state to use fentanyl in an execution, combining it with three other drugs to execute an inmate convicted of killing two Omaha cabdrivers. Other states debated or adopted options including nitrogen gas and firing squads.

The FDA, in defending its efforts to block states from importing unapproved sodium thiopental has cited the 2012 injunction relating to the drug.

That ruling came after death-row inmates filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, saying the FDA was acting unlawfully by exercising “enforcement discretion” to allow states to import unapproved sodium thiopental from an unregistered foreign facility.

Despite the 2012 order, however, states continued to order sodium thiopental from overseas. BuzzFeed News found that at least three states — Nebraska, Texas and Arizona — had tried to import drugs from a supplier in India despite getting warnings from the FDA in 2015.

The Texas lawsuit, filed in the waning days of the Obama administration, says the state alerted federal officials in June 2015 that its Department of Criminal Justice — which is responsible for the state’s executions — planned to “import thiopental sodium intended for law enforcement purposes.”

The lawsuit said the state’s “foreign distributor” shipped 1,000 vials of the drug to Houston in late July 2015, and not long after, the drugs were impounded. According to the FDA, the agency also impounded a shipment intended for Arizona that same year.

Texas officials said they had obtained the drugs legally and referred to the government’s actions as an “unjustified seizure.”

In April 2017, the FDA wrote a letter to Texas authorities saying that the agency could not admit the drugs.

Texas quickly filed an amended complaint, but in December, 2017, a federal judge in Texas stayed the case and later denied a motion to lift it.

The case remains stayed. A status conference had been scheduled for September 2018, but the Trump administration asked for a 90-day continuance and for the case to remain stayed, adding that Texas officials did not oppose that motion. The Trump administration wrote in that motion that the federal government had “internal deliberations” that could resolve the lawsuit in a way “that could allow this case to be resolved without additional litigation,” although it did not provide further details.

The DOJ won’t say why Rudy Giuliani hasn’t registered as a foreign agent under FARA law,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/why-isnt-rudy-giuliani-registered-as-a-foreign-agent-fara-lobbying-in-ukraine-a9289f19677e/,"Amid last week’s furor about Rudy Giuliani pledging to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — and Giuliani’s claim that he wanted to “meddl[e] in an investigation” regarding Biden’s son in Ukraine — was a small, buried detail that may yet unravel Giuliani’s entire plan.

Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, has worked in Ukraine since Trump’s inauguration, nominally as a security adviser to the city of Kharkiv with his firm Giuliani Partners. However, one of his local clients claimed last week that Giuliani provided far more than technical advice and a handful of photo-ops.

According to Ukrainian developer Pavel Fuks, Giuliani had been hired to work as a “lobbyist” for the government of Ukraine, as well as for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. “This is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the Times. The claim backs up local media coverage of the relationship, with one Ukrainian magazine writing that Fuks hired Giuliani in order to create an office in the U.S. for “supporting investment” in Kharkiv. As Mother Jones reported, Giuliani connected with Fuks via TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a New York-based company that has “advised Russian oligarchs and others with Kremlin ties.”

Giuliani denied Fuks’ claim, saying that Trump remains his “only client.” Giuliani didn’t respond to ThinkProgress’ questions on the matter, and ThinkProgress’ efforts to contact Fuks were unsuccessful.

If anyone needs to be investigated, it’s Rudy Giuliani. Rudy was “a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine” but failed to register under FARA. His clients, Pavel Fuks and Gennadiy Kernes, have reported ties to organized crime. How is he different than Manafort? https://t.co/O0ZdUkmoex — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) May 10, 2019

However, Fuks’ claim adds significant fuel to longstanding concerns about Giuliani’s decision not to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department — even as the agency goes to unprecedented lengths to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

FARA regulations, on the books since 1938, had remained an afterthought for decades. But thanks to Trump’s rise, and due especially to the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, FARA has seen new life. The DOJ already created a new task force to strengthen FARA, making sure that those working on behalf of foreign governments and officials disclose and detail their work with the DOJ, and prosecutors have shown a new willingness to finally enforce the regulations.

In just the past year, failing to register with FARA has tripped up former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former White House counsel Gregory Craig — both of whom were found guilty of failing to register their work on behalf of the former Ukrainian government. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA.

Giuliani, though, has thus far managed to escape scrutiny. And no one’s quite sure why.

Last September, months before Fuks claimed that Giuliani had been hired directly to lobby on behalf of Ukraine, a number of Democratic senators signed a letter to the DOJ requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA filings (or lack thereof). Giuliani admitted last year that he’d never filed a single FARA registration.

The senators specifically pointed to Giuliani’s work in Ukraine, including a press release linking Giuliani with Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, himself a former member of the party affiliated with ousted Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Both Manafort and Craig were indicted for failing to disclose FARA-related work on behalf of Yanukovych’s regime.

The senators writing to DOJ — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) — specifically singled out Giuliani’s work in Ukraine:

Giuliani’s work on behalf the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, whose mayor is a member of the Party of Regions is also concerning. The Ukrainian Party of Regions’ connections to the Russian Government and anti-democratic activity are well-documented. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who both served in senior roles on the President’s 2016 campaign team, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to criminal acts in part because of their work on behalf of this Russian-backed Ukrainian political party. Mr. Giuliani’s financial connection to the organization, the organization’s close ties with the Russian government, and Mr. Giuliani’s ongoing public advocacy against Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election raises further questions that warrant review.

And it’s not just Giuliani’s work in Ukraine. As the senators noted, Giuliani’s efforts at recruiting foreign clients — all while working closely with the sitting president — have spanned the globe. He’s represented the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, in its efforts to lift their Foreign Terrorist Organization designation from the State Department. He recently signed up with Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior, as The Daily Beast found. And, perhaps most notably, he wrote a remarkable letter to Romanian authorities, chastising the country’s prosecutor for being too effective at combating corruption — all while working at the behest of another lobbyist representing an official caught up in Romania’s anti-corruption dragnet.

But it was Giuliani’s misadventures in Ukraine that gained the most notoriety. And over the past week, the questions — about Giuliani’s aims, about who’s paying for his travel, about how much Trump knows — have only grown.

The DOJ, though, has been silent. As multiple staffers working for the Democratic senators told ThinkProgress, the DOJ never even bothered to reply to their inquiries about Giuliani’s FARA status.

“DOJ never responded to our letter,” a spokesperson for Udall told ThinkProgress. “However, we did confirm that they received it.”

As Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), another signatory of the letter requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA status, tweeted last Friday, “Giuliani has reportedly been paid by foreign [governments] + political parties, including in Ukraine, but FAILED to register as a foreign agent as the law requires. This is EXACTLY why I joined @SenatorTomUdall to ask DOJ to investigate. We never got a reply.”

Giuliani, unsurprisingly, has long denied any need to register as a foreign agent. Despite the fact that experts on FARA regulations have pointed to Giuliani’s foreign work time and again — both in terms of his speeches and political activities — as examples of FARA-related work, Giuliani has claimed that he’s not influencing American policy.

However, Giuliani also offered a caveat last week: “I don’t think I’m influencing American government except on behalf of my client to further an investigation.” That is, Giuliani admitted that he’s not working to “influence” U.S. policy — except when it comes to his client, the president of the United States.

It doesn’t appear concerns about FARA regulations will slow Giuliani’s work anytime soon. Despite calling off his trip to Ukraine — and despite Fuks’ claims that he has paperwork clarifying Giuliani’s work as a lobbyist in Ukraine — Giuliani has refused to acknowledge any issues with his work in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to FARA.

As he said on Friday, when it comes to Ukraine, “I’m going to make sure that nothing scuttles the investigation that I want.”"
'Morning Joe' guest blasts AG Barr as DOJ reverses on ObamaCare: 'Unmitigated disaster',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/morning-joe-guest-blasts-ag-barr-as-doj-reverses-on-obamacare-unmitigated-disaster,"Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson had some harsh words for Attorney General William Barr as his Justice Department faced criticism for changing its position on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- arguing that the entire law, rather than just parts, was unconstitutional.

“William Barr’s tenure as attorney general is going to be — so far it has been, I would say — a pretty unmitigated disaster,” Robinson told ""Morning Joe"" on Tuesday.

Robinson went on to question whether Barr even believed his the DOJ's decision, saying that it was ""destabilizing.""

“Is this something that Barr actually believes? Is he again nullifying the president who wants to get rid of anything with President Obama’s name on it?"" he asked. ""It’s unclear. But it’s deeply disturbing, even if this ultimately fails, even if ultimately, you know, the ACA is upheld, it’s destabilizing.""

His comments came after letters, in which congressional Democratic leaders demanded the DOJ provide details as to how the White House might have influenced its decision.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the letters read.

Mike Barnicle, journalist and frequent ""Morning Joe"" guest, criticized Democrats for giving the Justice Department two weeks to respond.

""If you have a preexisting condition, and you have to go to an emergency room, with yourself or with one of your children, you don’t get two weeks to respond!"" he said.

Barr is no stranger to criticism on MSNBC or the media in general. After he released a controversial summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, he experienced weeks of media criticism for allegedly shielding President Donald Trump from scrutiny.

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Says Courts Should Settle Fight Over Trump's Taxes,http://time.com,['Andrew Taylor'],,,,http://time.com/5589731/steven-mnuchin-courts-trump-taxes/,"(WASHINGTON) — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that it’s up to the courts to referee his dispute with House Democrats demanding access to President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Mnuchin told a Senate panel that the fight between the administration and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, “will go to the third branch of government to be resolved.”

Neal, D-Mass., has subpoenaed six years’ worth of Trump’s returns with an eye to examining whether Trump is paying all the taxes he owes and whether his web of businesses has created conflicts of interest with his official actions as president. Neal has set a Friday deadline for the IRS to deliver them.

“We haven’t made a decision but I think you can guess which way we’re leaning on our subpoena,” Mnuchin said, adding, “I take great comfort that there is a third branch of government to deal with this important issue.”

Mnuchin is sticking to earlier arguments that Neal’s demand for Trump’s taxes would set a precedent that lawmakers could pursue confidential tax information for political purposes. He said Treasury and IRS lawyers agree with his interpretation that a 1924 law that requires him to “furnish” the returns to Neal does not apply in this case because there is no legitimate legislative purpose to Neal’s request.

Mnuchin said the tax tussle was “a very important issue that has a precedent way beyond any one president and Congress.”

“There is a difference in interpretation between Congress and us and the Department of Justice around this law that not only impacts this president and this Congress but has a very big impact on every single taxpayer in weaponizing the IRS,” Mnuchin said. “And this is why there are three branches of government.”

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: DOJ inspector general FISA probe will find 'mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-doj-inspector-general-will-find-mistakes-in-fisa-probe,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Monday he expects the Justice Department inspector general to find ""mistakes"" committed by the bureau in its handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."
DOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/443712-doj-requests-to-appeal-rulings-advancing-dems-emoluments-clause,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday requested that a judge allow a higher court review previous rulings in favor of a lawsuit alleging President Trump Donald John TrumpChris Evans: 'If you're not worried about Roe v Wade, you're not paying attention' Trump dismisses reports of infighting over Iran policy Barr jokes with Pelosi: 'Did you bring your handcuffs?' MORE has violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.

The DOJ attorneys argue in the filing that there is enough ""difference of opinion"" on the legal questions in the lawsuit, including the definition of the Emoluments Clause, that an appeals court should review Judge Emmet Sullivan's rulings before the case advances.

And the Justice Department, which is representing the president in the lawsuit filed by more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” of the case mean that a higher court should review its merits even before the lawsuit advances in district court.

“[D]espite the 150-year unbroken history of federal courts refraining from enjoining a sitting President in the performance of his official duties, this Court determined that it has the power to do so,” the filing reads.

The lawyers also argued that an appeals court could either significantly narrow the scope of the lawsuit, or rule that the Democratic members of Congress behind the complaint don’t have standing to sue and shutter the case altogether.

And they claim that Sullivan’s ruling on the lawsuit last month “broadly interpreted the Foreign Emoluments Clause in a manner that calls into doubt the constitutionality of conduct of public officials — from President George Washington to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama5 steps toward minimizing your cyber risk DOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump Fewer graduates are choosing government jobs MORE — that has been accepted throughout history.""

The DOJ lawyers also requested that Sullivan, a Clinton appointee, temporarily halt proceedings in the lawsuit while he considers their motion and continue that stay if a higher court does take up their appeal.

""This case presents the unprecedented circumstance of impending civil discovery against the sitting President of the United States concerning his compliance with a constitutional provision in his official capacity. Any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President’s performance of his constitutional duties,"" the filing reads.

If the judge grants the motion, the D.C. Circuit will likely take up the appeal.

The Democratic members of Congress behind the lawsuit argue that Trump is in violation of the Emoluments Clause when he profits from foreign governments without congressional approval.

They have pointed to Trump’s global businesses, and their continuing operations while he is in office, as evidence that he is violating the clause.

The Justice Department has argued that Trump cannot violate the clause with any commercial profits, but only if he receives gifts or directly profits from an action he takes as president on behalf of foreign officials. DOJ is representing Trump in the case because he is being sued in his official capacity as president and not as an individual.

Trump is also facing a lawsuit from D.C. and Maryland alleging that he violated the Emoluments Clause."

Sen. Ron Wyden is demanding more information about the Trump administration’s decision to reject House Democrats’ demand for the president’s tax filings.

In a letter released Tuesday, Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to turn over any communications his agency has had with the White House or Trump’s personal lawyers related to Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s (D-Mass.) request last month for the returns.

Wyden also wants details of any meetings, discussions, memoranda and other documents related to the denial.

“I am concerned that you are taking unprecedented steps that seriously undermine the ability of the congressional tax-writing committees to obtain tax return information necessary to the performance of their legislative duties,” Wyden wrote.

He sent a separate letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig asking for details of his contacts with the agency’s legal staff regarding Neal's request.

The letters come one day before Mnuchin and Rettig are slated to appear before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the Treasury Department’s annual budget request.

Neal last month requested six years' worth of Trump’s personal returns and some of his business returns under a 95-year old statute allowing the heads of Congress’ tax committees to examine anyone’s private tax information. Mnuchin refused, saying Democrats do not have a legitimate reason for seeking the filings, and he now faces a May 17 deadline to comply with a subpoena for the records.

Indiana veterans' affairs staffers resign after scandal; criminal investigation opened,https://www.indystar.com,"['Tony Cook', 'Published A.M.

Stephen J. Beard/IndyStar, Stephen J. Beard/IndyStar

An IndyStar investigation exposed the possible misuse of more than $800,000.

Three top employees at the Indiana Department of Veterans' Affairs have resigned in the wake of an IndyStar investigation into the possible abuse of funds intended for needy veterans.

And in a separate development, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry has opened an investigation into possible criminal wrongdoing at the agency.

The resignations are part of a reorganization effort led by the agency's new director, Dennis Wimer, who has pledged to restore confidence in the IDVA after a series of IndyStar stories since November has exposed the possible misuse of more than $800,000.

The resigning employees — Deputy Director Matthew Vincent, Communications Director Adryanne Bonner and Director of Employment and Veteran Outreach Jeff Wirt — either approved or received grants or welfare benefits administered by the agency.

A criminal investigation launched

In addition to the personnel changes, a spokeswoman for Curry acknowledged Tuesday that the office has launched an investigation to determine whether any laws were broken.

The probe comes as a surprise because Indiana Inspector General Lori Torres had suggested in a report last month that prosecutors had reviewed her office's investigation and agreed with her assessment that there was insufficient evidence for criminal charges.

Curry's office now says it is conducting its own review.

""We did not formally decline prosecution and have opened an investigation into the matter,"" said Curry's chief of staff, Peg McLeish.

McLeish said the prosecutor's office had informal conversations with an investigator from the inspector general's office, but did not see the final report or case file until it was made public last month.

""The only thing we had before this report was very informal conversations,"" she said.

She said there is no time frame for the investigation.

Stephanie McFarland, a spokeswoman for the inspector general's office, defended the IG report's assertion that prosecutors found insufficient evidence to support criminal charges. She said ""that was the viewpoint expressed to the OIG agent at the time this specific finding was presented.""

""The prosecutor, however, is always free to reevaluate,"" she said.

3 managers leaving IDVA

As for the personnel shakeup, Vincent, the agency's No. 2 and former acting director, resigned early last week in a letter to Gov. Eric Holcomb. A Marine veteran, Vincent had approved some of the grants that drew scrutiny in a state audit last year. His final day will be May 31.

Also stepping down is Communications Director Adryanne Bonner, who previously managed the agency's federal welfare program.

""At this time, I am submitting my letter of resignation so that the agency can move forward to positively impact and regain the trust of veterans,"" Bonner wrote May 6 to Wimer.

IndyStar had reported that Bonner and her boyfriend — both veterans — had received more than $10,000 in benefits, including child care and a couple's retreat at French Lick Resort and Casino. She earns a salary of $51,000.

Director of Employment Jeff Wirt, an Iraq war veteran, submitted his resignation letter on the same day as Bonner. Wirt earns nearly $50,000 a year but received $3,600 in military relief grants for expenses that included new tires and vehicle repairs, IndyStar found. Other veterans — including a woman living in a camper with her two children — were capped at $2,500 and denied benefits for similar expenses.

Wirt's final day is June 14, according to his resignation letter.

The departures follow that of former Director Jim Brown, who resigned in December just one week after IndyStar's initial story.

In an email Thursday informing veterans' affairs commissioners about the resignations, Wimer praised the employees for their ""passion for serving veterans"" and wished them well.

State officials did not immediately address whether any of the employees would be offered jobs at other state agencies.

IndyStar sought reaction from Gov. Eric Holcomb, who is ultimately responsible for the IDVA, but his office provided only a statement from January in which Holcomb says he has directed Wimer to ""make any and all necessary changes to restore the confidence of the department and the trust of Hoosier veterans.""

Interior's border surge puts more officers in unfamiliar role,https://thehill.com,[],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/443727-interiors-border-surge-puts-more-officers-in-unfamiliar-role,"The Interior Department has doubled the number of law enforcement officers it’s sending to the border, according to new data reviewed by The Hill, putting police who usually patrol national parks and wildlife refuges in the new and unfamiliar role of dealing with a surge in immigration.

Since the pilot program began last May, Interior has increased the number of law enforcement officers assigned to assist U.S. Border Patrol under its surge support operations, from 22 to 47.

Critics of the Trump administration’s deployment say the Interior officers are untrained to handle immigration issues at the border.

“Quite frankly, they are just being thrown into the mix and there isn’t any training,” said Michael Shalton, president of the U.S. Park Police (USPP) Fraternal Order of Police. “They are just supplementing and being told to do whatever Border Patrol tells them to do.”

USPP officers are ill-equipped for the border assignments because for many of them, urban policing is their primary role, Shalton said. Park police are traditionally tasked with overseeing federal parks and roadways in Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco.

“It’s an officer safety concern. And as far as folks receiving adequate training in a desert environment, officers in the Northeast aren’t really being prepared for that,” he said. “We have voiced concerns, but it has fallen on deaf ears.”

Officers participating in the year-old pilot program now outnumber permanent Interior law enforcement staff assigned to federal lands along the Mexican border, according to agency figures.

The roughly 47 officers sent from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (NPS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for three-week temporary posts along the border exceed the 41 full-time staff stationed at the parks and refuges adjacent to Mexico.

While the number of officers detailed to the border is small when compared with the thousands of National Guard troops recently assigned to the area, critics say the absence of officers from their regular posts is a big drain on an already-shrinking staff.

“I have no problem with reporting whatever mission we’re tasked with doing, but we have to have adequate staffing here and we have to be supplemented,” Shalton said.

He said there are about 570 officers in D.C., a decrease of almost 100 from a decade ago.

“That’s a lot for a small agency,” he added.

Interior’s program, known as the Border Support Surge, was launched last spring by now-former Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeInterior's border surge puts more officers in unfamiliar role Not 'if' but 'when' is the next Deepwater Horizon spill? Former Wyoming GOP lawmaker mulling Senate bid to replace Enzi MORE, who said it would be one of several steps the agency would take to ""secure the homeland.""

The Senate last month confirmed Secretary David Bernhardt as the new agency chief.

GOP sees 'opportunity' to outlaw abortion under Trump, says political editor Bush economics director says psychiatrists labeled Trump 'total narcissist' MORE’s border security initiative, the operation is expected to continue detailing Interior’s park police and wildlife refuge enforcement officers to the border.

The agency's budget request for 2020 highlights the border surge as an ongoing priority. Interior asked for $930.3 million in law enforcement funding for such programs starting Oct. 1.

“The Department of the Interior manages hundreds of miles along the U.S. southern border, and our law enforcement officers are vested partners in the administration’s border security efforts,” Interior wrote in its March budget overview. “This budget continues to support a robust law enforcement program.”

The request for border enforcement funding comes as the department overall faces steep budget cuts. Trump’s spending proposal for 2020 calls for slashing Interior's budget by 14 percent.

The Interior Department is already facing a more than $11 billion maintenance backlog that some experts say was compounded by this year’s 35-day partial government shutdown, when the majority of parks remained open to the public.

As part of the surge, Interior law enforcement officers were initially stationed at places like South Texas National Wildlife Refuge and Organ Pipe Cactus National Park in Arizona, according to an internal document obtained by The Hill through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The memorandum dated May 1, 2018, and signed by Scott Cameron, acting Interior assistant secretary, said Border Patrol (BP) chose areas they believe “best address the support mission.”

“The DOI’s commitment to this surge mission will assist BP in preventing illegal entry into the United States, and will protect our federal lands, to include the natural and cultural resources as well as enhance visitor safety and experience,” Cameron wrote.

Interior declined to provide any update on new locations for law enforcement officers along the border.

The agency says it has reason to celebrate the initiative. Interior officers have apprehended 7,183 migrants and seized 1,487 pounds of marijuana on federal land along the border, according to internal data shared with The Hill.

“The 2020 budget helps foster safe and drug-free communities by increasing funding for law enforcement,” the agency wrote in its budget proposal.

Larry Cosme, national executive vice president for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said some Interior officers supported their mission at the border.

""We, the men and women, civil servants, place the needs of our country above ourselves sometimes,” he said. “In this case, homeland defense and security is the need of our country and the men and women stand by to serve, protect and defend. At this time, it is along the southern border.”

But one NPS law enforcement officer who was detailed to the border said the arrest and drug-seizure numbers are little to boast about.

“Fifteen-hundred pounds on DOI land seems like nothing. That doesn’t seem low for now, though, because there is less marijuana on DOI lands than there were two years ago,” the officer told The Hill, pointing to the overall drop in marijuana smuggling at the border.

“This is an inappropriate use of government money. ... The numbers are the same. I was kinda hopeful that when Zinke left this would fade away, and this is very clearly not fading away.”

For comparison, U.S. Border Patrol seized 300,289 pounds of marijuana and arrested 396,579 illegal crossers in fiscal 2018.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees Interior, called the department’s border program “a sustained attack on the rule of law.”

“The president’s border policies have gone from a political stunt to a sustained attack on the rule of law. He and his friends in Washington lie to the public and manipulate immigration data to excuse their racist, counterproductive efforts to militarize our border with one of our oldest allies,” Grijalva, whose congressional district borders Mexico, told The Hill in a statement Tuesday.

“Treating law enforcement agents like the president’s personal toys is a hallmark of a banana republic, not a functioning democracy,” he said.

Interior did not respond to a request for comment.

Grijalva on Wednesday will lead House Democrats in grilling Bernhardt, who is attending his first hearing in front of the committee as Interior chief, and the role of agency officers is expected to come up.

“The Interior Department needs to explain immediately why these transfers are a good use of taxpayer money,” Grijalva said. “And if it can’t, this farcical program needs to shut down.”"
Rosenstein slams Comey for becoming a 'partisan pundit',https://www.politico.com,"['Caitlin Oprysko', 'Burgess Everett']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/rod-rosenstein-james-comey-doj-1319967,"Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia justified and pledged he would never have let anyone interfere with that investigation. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Politics Rosenstein slams Comey for becoming a 'partisan pundit'

Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized former FBI Director James Comey for becoming a “partisan pundit” in the two years since he was fired by President Donald Trump.

In some of Rosenstein’s first extended remarks since leaving the Justice Department last week, the former deputy attorney general called Comey’s dismissal, which set off a firestorm in Washington and resulted in the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, “reasonable under the circumstances,” citing Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Story Continued Below

Rosenstein, who authored the memo that the Trump administration initially held up as the reason for Comey’s firing, said the president did not tell him what to put in that memo. And he said that though he didn’t dislike Comey — “On the contrary, I admired him personally” — the former FBI director crossed certain “bright lines” that were “not within the realm of reasonable decisions.”

“I would be the last one to condemn anyone for a judgment call,” Rosenstein said in remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee's annual meeting. “These jobs are difficult. They involve choices that invite criticism.”

Still, the former deputy attorney general said “the clearest mistake” Comey made was announcing his recommendation about the investigation into Clinton’s private email server at a news conference in which he discussed “details about the investigation without the informed consent of the prosecutors and the attorney general.” He also criticized Comey for his letter to lawmakers in the 2016 presidential campaign's final days informing them the Clinton email investigation had been reopened.

The former deputy attorney general said that had he been in Trump’s shoes when the president was deciding whether to fire Comey in 2017, he would have included “a more balanced analysis of the pros and cons.” He also said he would have ensured Comey’s dismissal was carried out with “far more respect and far less drama,” alluding to Comey finding out about his dismissal on TV during a trip to Los Angeles.

“So I do not blame the former director for being angry. I would be too if I were in his shoes,” Rosenstein said. ""But now the former director seems to be acting as a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul. I kid you not.""

Rosenstein’s criticism of Comey is the latest salvo in what has evolved into a war of words between the two former colleagues. Comey has become a major public figure in the wake of his dismissal and has been at times lauded as a hero by Trump’s critics. Several weeks ago, Comey penned an op-ed in The New York Times ripping into Attorney General William Barr and accusing Barr and others in Trump’s administration of lacking the “inner strength” to stand up to the president and writing that Trump “eats your soul in small bites.” In a televised town hall last week, Comey described Rosenstein to CNN’s Anderson Cooper as a person “of accomplishment but not real sterling character, strong character.”

""That is disappointing,"" Rosenstein shot back Monday. ""Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors.""

But while he defended Trump’s decision to fire Comey and his own role in the move, Rosenstein criticized the president’s manner of doing so and called the department’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia justified and said he would never have let anyone interfere with that investigation.

The former deputy attorney general argued that several of Trump’s campaign aides were under FBI investigation for their communications with Russian agents.

“At the time these were allegations. They were leads, what we call predication,” he said, adding later that the department was “not out to get anyone — we’re out to follow facts.”

He also appeared to take credit for an investigation into the Russia probe’s origins, telling the audience he wanted to ensure the Justice Department's inspector general was conducting a thorough examination of the surveillance of the Trump campaign."
"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

House Democrats are mounting yet another confrontation with the Justice Department that could lead to subpoenas, but this time it's not about special counsel Robert Mueller's report — it's about health care.

Five committee chairmen foreshadowed a possible subpoena as soon as May 24 if Attorney General William Barr declines to provide documents related to his decision to stop defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act — the health care law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Story Continued Below

In letters to Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the chairmen wrote they've been asking since April 8 for documents connected to the decision, as well as testimony from four key officials involved in the effort. The request, they said, sought a response by April 22 but that the reply fell short. Now, they've given the Justice Department two more weeks to meet the committees' demands. They've also asked the White House to make budget director Russ Vought available for an interview.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The letters are signed by Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

Nadler's committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report to Congress as well as Mueller's underlying evidence. But the full House has yet to consider the committee's effort. Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week that other committees may want to combine similar contempt proceedings into one overarching floor vote that could come in the next few weeks.

Democrats are also locked in confrontations with the Trump administration over accessing Trump's tax returns — a request made by Neal's Ways and Means Committee. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded access to Mueller's report, as well, on national security grounds and has issued a subpoena for his files last week.

The new effort on health care could become part of Democrats' broader strategy if they continue to accuse the Justice Department of stonewalling by the time the new deadline arrives on May 24. But persuading other lawmakers to wait until June — after a weeklong Memorial Day recess — for a comprehensive contempt vote could be difficult. Rank-and-file Democrats have been clamoring for punitive measures against Barr for weeks for his handling of Mueller's report.

Democratic leaders believe that picking a fight on health care is better politics than other demands are — and the skirmish shows their efforts to confront the Trump administration have policy dimensions and aren't just Trump-focused investigations.

Democrats have attributed the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the health care law, known as Obamacare, to ""politically motivated forces"" in the White House. The Obama White House took a similar step in 2011 when the Justice Department, at Obama's urging, stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages — a move social conservatives denounced at the time.

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

The Energy 202: EPA finally added West Virginia site plagued by chemical dumping to priority cleanup list,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/,"THE LIGHTBULB

A local company that once helped the West Virginia town of Minden thrive had for for decades dumped untold amounts of industrial chemicals nearby. Years after that coal-equipment manufacturer shuttered and the rest of the local coal economy fell into decline, those toxic chemicals remained.

Now the federal government is saying it will make cleaning up Minden a priority. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency finally added a site in the tiny town of 250 people to its national priority list for contaminated Superfund sites. The government says it prioritize cleaning up a former manufacturing site for Shaffer Equipment Co. and nearby areas around Arbuckle Creek, where the company used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which had been added to oil used by electrical equipment until 1984.

For years, Minden residents said they were being overlooked by federal authorities, even as many of them were diagnosed with an alarming number of cancers and other health issues. Local activists told The Post's Brady Dennis for a profile he wrote of the community they found about a third of Minden residents have died of or been diagnosed with cancer in recent years.

They suspected the cause was PCBs. Yet testing by state and federal officials was not able to definitively establish that link. Still, residents pressed their case with the Trump administration, which proposed last September to add the Minden site to the Superfund list.

West Virginia politicians praised the move on Monday, which open remediation of the site up to an injection of new federal funding through the Superfund program. “This is such an important day because the great people of Minden have been hurting for too long and they’ve been waiting on this level of help for decades,” Gov. Jim Justice (R) said.

So too did local leaders, such as Ayne Amjad, a doctor who helped research the health problems and spent years trying to raise the profile of the town. “So to get so much national support and to see it come to this is such a great feeling,” she said Monday, adding that activists will turn now to relocation efforts for Minden residents living near the toxic site.

In a sign of how intractable some pollutants are, though, the EPA has already undertaken several rounds of cleanups in Minden since 1984, removing dozens of PCB-laced drums buried underground and hauling away nearly 5,000 tons of soil.

The listing is a small part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to revitalize the nearly 40-year-old Superfund program, designed to clean up more than 1,300 hazardous sites across the country. Compelling companies to pay up for cleanup efforts has proved to be one of the few issues on which the EPA has been willing to side with environmental groups during the Trump administration.

LIVE from Howard University in Washington DC the last #Road2GND tour stop.comment ""debate"" on this livestream to get involved via facebook messenger. Posted by Sunrise Movement on Monday, May 13, 2019

— A Green New Deal rally in Washington: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) headlined a rally Monday at Howard University, continuing to call for a Green New Deal after a recent legislative defeat in the Senate. The event, organized by youth climate activist group Sunrise Movement, was the last stop on the group’s “Road to the Green New Deal tour,” which aimed to tout the proposal, even after it failed in a March vote in the Senate.

Next steps: The Sunrise Movement laid out its plans for the next several months, which include giving 2020 candidates until the end of July to sign a no-fossil-fuel-money pledge and to promise to make the Green New Deal a ""Day 1"" priority in the White House.

No ""middle ground"": Audience members booed several times at mentions of finding a ""middle ground"" on climate change, a reference to a recent Reuters article that describes former vice president Joe Biden's yet-to-be-released position on climate change.

Meanwhile in New Hampshire: Biden tried to hammer home to Democratic voters in the early-primary state that he is serious about climate change. “I said, we have an existential threat, we are in a situation where, if we don’t act quickly, we’re going to basically lose almost everything we have,"" he said, according to The New York Times.

President Trump wrote on Twitter last week that he opposed a House bill that would help a Massachusetts Indian tribe build a casino. (Evan Vucci/AP)

— Why did the president tweet about an obscure House bill? Last week, Trump tweeted to express opposition to House Resolution 312, which would grant a Massachusetts Indian tribe control of 321 acres of land for a casino. He wrote on Twitter it was “unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!” But the tribe’s site is about 18 miles from Rhode Island, where state politicians ""aren’t keen to have a new competitor go up against their two casinos, both of which are run by Twin River Worldwide Holdings, a public company with strong Trump ties,"" The Post’s Marc Fisher reports.

Flashback to 1993: The president has a long history of criticizing casinos built Native Americans as fraudulent. More than two decades ago, Trump the casino owner urged a House committee to assess whether tribe members operating the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were really Native Americans. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump said back then.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)

— The latest on the impasse over disaster funding: The Senate is looking to vote on a much-anticipated but not-yet-finalized disaster-aid package next week, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hoped to approve a deal ahead of the Memorial Day recess, Politico reports.

McConnell called on lawmakers in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to “identify our common ground and produce an outcome for the American people” on the measure meant to provide aid for communities recovering from natural disasters. “Next week is the week before a big break,” said Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) “I can’t predict what will happen, but I think something is either going to hit the floor dealing with that, or maybe we’ll all come to an agreement.”

Meanwhile: McConnell is looking to use the sweeping disaster aid bill to add protections for hemp farmers, according to a draft provision reviewed by The Post. “Now, with a $17 billion disaster bill stalled on Capitol Hill amid a series of political skirmishes, McConnell is trying to add language to the legislation to ensure hemp will be eligible for federal crop insurance,” The Post’s Erica Werner reports. “It was not immediately clear what impact McConnell’s hemp language might have on larger negotiations over the bill, which have been hung up for months in a fight between congressional Democrats and President Trump over aid to Puerto Rico.”

— “Watergate this was not”: When he looked to get in touch with the state’s ornithologist regarding a story about birds, the Boston Globe’s David Abel writes he wasn’t granted access to Andrew Vitz, who works for the state’s Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Instead, he was sent a bulleted list of background responses, only one of which answered a question he had asked.

Abel described a back-and-forth between himself and a press secretary at the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who he said he doesn't blame for the stone-walling. “It’s the policy from her bosses that’s the problem. They have made it clear that they won’t allow me, or many of my colleagues, to speak directly with the experts in government who can often best answer our questions — even when it’s a story about birds,"" he writes of a problem that has become ""not unusual"" since Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) was elected.

THERMOMETER

— Here’s what you can do now to save species: Save water, buy fewer products encased in plastic, revamp your front lawn.

These are a few things experts say Americans can do each day as a first step to helping save the plant and animal species facing extinction, according to The Post’s Darryl Fears. For example, grass yards, which use up 9 billion gallons of water per day, are the largest irrigated crop in the country. Collin O’Mara, president and chief executive of the National Wildlife Foundation, called lawns “basically biodiversity wastelands” and recommends making space for “milkweed and flowers can support numerous species of butterflies and moths. A single ginkgo tree will support numerous species of caterpillars,” Fears writes.

— “We don’t know a planet like this”: There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any point since the evolution of humans, according to data from the Muana Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The concentration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere has surpassed 415 parts per million, according to a Friday reading. “CO2 levels millions of years ago were higher than 2019 levels, but Earth's temperatures were also much higher,” USA Today reports. “In the 800,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels didn't surpass 300 ppm.”

The reaction from meteorologist Eric Holthaus:

This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has had more than 415ppm CO2.



Not just in recorded history, not just since the invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Since before modern humans existed millions of years ago.

Pompeo shares details on 'escalating' Iran threats in Brussels: U.S. State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-pompeo/pompeo-shared-details-on-iran-threats-with-nato-state-department-idUSKCN1SJ1XN,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shared information on “escalating” threats from Iran with European allies and NATO officials during meetings in Brussels on Monday, the U.S. special representative for Iran said.

“Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Brian Hook told reporters, referring to Pompeo’s planned visit to Russia on Tuesday for meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo canceled a visit to Moscow on Monday and stopped in Brussels instead, en route to Sochi.

“The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly,” Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats. They have chosen poorly by focusing on threats.”

Hook said Pompeo, while in Brussels, also discussed reported attacks on several oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

Asked if Pompeo was blaming Iran for the attacks, Hook said: “We discussed ... what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah ... we have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.”

Asked if he himself believed there was the possibility of an Iranian role, Hook had no comment.

The UAE said on Sunday that four commercial vessels were sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz. It did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

Saudi Arabia said Monday that two of its oil tankers were among those attacked and described it as an attempt to undermine the security of crude supplies amid tensions between the United States and Iran.

The UAE on Monday identified the vessels as very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, both owned by Saudi shipping firm Bahri. The other two were UAE-flagged fuel bunker barge A. Michel and Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory."
"George Papadopoulos calls on Barr, DOJ inspector general to examine 'marked' $10K from alleged spy",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-papadopoulos-calls-on-barr-doj-inspector-general-to-examine-marked-10k-from-alleged-spy,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos wants federal investigators to look into a $10,000 payment he claims to have received in the summer 2017 from a man he believes was a foreign spy.

The money, he said on Tuesday, might have come from special counsel Robert Mueller's team in an effort to entrap him.

""I actually want Congress, Barr, Horowitz, and Huber to review the bills,"" Papadopoulos said on Fox Business, referring to Attorney General William Barr, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber — all of whom are conducting investigations into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and possible misconduct by federal officials.

As Papadopoulos would tell it, a man gave him the money in a Israel hotel room for some sort of Mediterranean-Middle East political consulting venture they discussed. Beyond his work for the Ben Carson and Trump presidential campaigns, Papadopoulos was also an energy consultant. Papadopoulos said he felt uncomfortable and gave the money to his lawyer in Athens, Greece, but the man would not take the money back.

In July 2017, Papadopoulos flew to Dulles International Airport outside Washington where FBI agents placed him under arrest. He pleaded guilty October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year. He also was fined $9,500 and ordered to do community service. Papadopoulos additionally agreed to cooperate with the Russia investigation conducted by Mueller, who recently wrapped up and found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The FBI launched its original counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016. It was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the FBI that Papadopoulos told him Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos has said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who told him about the alleged dirt on Clinton, was also working for Western intelligence.

Papadopoulos said on Tuesday that the money is still with his lawyer in Greece. He said he believes the bills are ""marked"" and have a traceable link to the Obama Justice Department, FBI, and even Mueller himself.

""If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn't just me they did it to — it's going to open up a massive can of worms,"" Papadopoulos said. ""I think we need to get to the bottom of exactly not only how did this story start, but why were they entrapping us moving forward.""

Papadopoulos informed federal investigators about the payment. It is mentioned at the bottom of an August memo from Mueller that recommended Papadopoulos serve up to six months in jail for misleading the FBI.

""Based on the defendant’s offense level under the Guidelines, the applicable range for a fine is $500 to $9,500,"" the memo reads. ""The defendant provided information about $10,000 in cash he received from a foreign national whom he believed was likely an intelligence officer of a foreign country (other than Russia). The defendant has stated that he kept that money in a safe pending his sentencing in this case and Counsel for the defendant has consented to the imposition of this fine amount. Forfeiture is not applicable in this case.""

Papadopoulos identified the man he allegedly met and received the $10,000 from as Israeli American businessman Charles Tawil. The individual who introduced Papadopoulos to Tawil was an Israeli political strategist named David Ha’ivri. Ha’ivri told the Daily Caller that he was unaware of a $10,000 payment to Papadopoulos, but Tawil did secure a consulting contract with a petroleum and gas infrastructure company with a retainer of $10,000 a month after talks with Papadopoulos fell apart due to his ""immaturity.""

Ha’ivri said he was unaware the FBI was investigating Papadopoulos when he introduced Tawil to him. “Had we known about them before we would have never reached out to a guy like George,” he said.

Tawil told the Times of Israel that Papadopoulos never asked him to take back the money and “was desperate to work with me.” He also denied being part of some entrapment plot. ""First of all, I support Trump, so why would I entrap a pro-Trump guy?” he said. “I like the fact that Trump is the president. I wanted him to be president. I worked a lot in Africa and I see the damage that Clinton and Obama did to the world. Trump may be eccentric but he is at least straightforward.”"

EPA moves to ease water-quality standards in Washington state; Inslee and Ferguson say that’s illegal,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inslee-ferguson-denounce-epa-move-to-ease-water-standards-for-washington-state/,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ease Washington water-quality standards for chemicals discharged into state waterways, a move embraced by industry groups that sought the change and denounced as “illegal” by Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

The action, disclosed Friday, reverses a 2016 decision by the EPA under the Obama administration that required the state to toughen the water-quality standard.

Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, said his agency had “inherent authority” to reconsider the 2016 decision, according to a letter Hladick sent Friday to Maia Bellon, the director of the state Ecology Department.

Ferguson and Inslee, in a joint statement, said “by taking this unilateral action, the EPA will risk almost certain litigation and cause uncertainty for Washington businesses.”

A major point of contention is the water-quality standard for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a group of chemicals considered to be probable carcinogens. PCBs can be found in dyes, paint, building materials, coolants and other products. In trace amounts, they often are present in industry wastewater discharges as well as municipal utility plants that treat stormwater runoff. Once in Puget Sound and freshwater drainage, they accumulate in fish and shellfish, so ingesting this food in large volumes can increase cancer risks.

In Washington, the PCBs water standard has been subject of years of intense scrutiny.

Tribal leaders pressed for tighter pollution limits to protect their members, who may eat far more fish and shellfish than other Washington residents. They were dismayed by the Trump administration’s EPA decision, which they said was done without the consultation required by the federal government’s treaties and trust responsibilities to tribes.

“This action is outrageous,” said Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. “Like all federal agencies, the EPA has a legally binding trust responsibility to the tribes that requires government-to-government consultation and the protection of tribal treaty rights and resources. They are not living up to this responsibility that is rooted in the U.S. Constitution.”

Paper and pulp manufacturers and other industry groups applauded the Trump administration decision.

They had opposed the Obama administration standard, saying that there was no technology available to bring wastewater discharge of PCBs to the low levels that were required. In a written statement, Donna Harmon, president of the American Forest & Paper Association, said, “The earlier EPA rule represented costly and ineffective regulatory overreach — plain and simple.”

The clash over PCB standards has unfolded under the umbrella of the federal Clean Water Act, which creates a partnership between the state and federal government to protect and when necessary restore the nation’s waterways.

Under the act, states have authority to develop water-quality standards, and the EPA the power of review.

Advertising

During the Obama administration, the EPA partially disapproved of a state standard — developed by the Washington Department of Ecology while Inslee was governor. The EPA ruled the state standard for PCBs — 170 parts per quadrillion in wastewater discharges — did not go far enough in protecting the health of heavy consumers of Washington fish. Instead, the EPA sent a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion.

In February 2017, after the Trump administration took office, industry and water utility groups filed a petition to the EPA arguing that the action under the Obama administration unjustly overturned the state standard and that it should be pulled back.

Meanwhile, state officials accepted the EPA decision and went to work with stakeholders, including tribes and industry representatives, to find ways to implement new standards.

Colleen Keltz, an Ecology Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 7 parts per quadrillion standard may not be obtainable with current technology. But she said that the state is working under a new system that allows permitted discharges to have a variance that allows higher levels of discharges until technology is available to meet the standard.

But the EPA, under the Trump administration, dismissed the need to try to reach the lower standard. In a 32-page document released Friday, the EPA said the earlier state PCBs standard of 170 parts per quadrillion should be restored, saying that that standard was based on sound science.

Hladick’s criticisms of the 2016 EPA PCBs decision were rejected by Dennis McLerran, who served as regional administrator for the EPA under President Barack Obama. McLerran acknowledged that some standards are “aspirational” but said the earlier EPA action was based on the best science available and that the rule allowed for flexibility when dischargers could not meet the standard.

McLerran said it was “very unusual and inappropriate” to pull it back without first consulting with tribes and state officials.

“I think it is a very unfortunate thing. The state had made it clear that it was implementing the standards, and found them to be correct,” McLerran said.

State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, disagrees with McLerran.

In a note sent this week to Ecology Department Director Bellon, Ericksen wrote that the initial state water-quality rule was the product of years of work by legislators, state officials and stakeholders. Ericksen said he was confused why Bellon would now oppose efforts to restore that rule, and urged that she reconsider that position."
Marco Rubio Urges DOJ to Investigate John Kerry's Meetings With Iranian Officials,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Jack Crowe', 'David French', 'John Fund', 'Kyle Smith', 'Katherine Timpf', 'Rich Lowry', 'Read More', 'The Week', 'The American Conservative', 'The Wall Street Journal']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/marco-rubio-investigate-john-kerry-meetings-iranian-officials/,"Then-Secretary of State John Kerry in 2016. (David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters)

Senator Marco Rubio sent a letter Monday to Attorney General William Barr asking him to investigate whether former secretary of state John Kerry violated federal law by continuing to meet with Iranian officials after leaving office.

“The Department of Justice should therefore make a determination on whether or not former Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s recent actions related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran potentially violate the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Rubio wrote.

The letter, Rubio’s second urging an investigation into Kerry’s conduct, comes after President Trump suggested that Kerry should be prosecuted under the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without the permission of U.S. officials.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump told reporters last week. “John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that.”

Kerry’s camp pushed back on Trump’s assertion in a statement provided to CNN.

“Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesperson for Kerry told CNN. “He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”

Rubio sent his first letter on the subject to then-attorney general Jeff Sessions in September 2018, after the Boston Globe reported that Kerry was “quietly seeking to salvage the Iran deal he helped craft” by engaging “in some unusual shadow diplomacy” with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Though he would not comment on what was discussed, Kerry did admit to meeting with Zarif “three or four” times since Trump took office. The Globe further reported that Kerry formed a team “of officials who were his top advisers at the State Department” to shape media coverage of Trump’s departure from the Iran deal."
U.S. State Department orders most government staff to leave Iraq,https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/05/15/us-embassy-in-iraq-says-the-state-department-has-ordered-all-non-emergency-government-staff-to-leave-iraq-right-away/,"BAGHDAD — The U.S. on Wednesday ordered all nonessential government staff to leave Iraq, and Germany and the Netherlands both suspended their military assistance programs in the country in the latest sign of tensions sweeping the Persian Gulf region over still-unspecified threats that the Trump administration says are linked to Iran.

Recent days have seen allegations of sabotage targeting oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, a drone attack by Yemen’s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels, and the dispatch of U.S. warships and bombers to the region.

At the root of this appears to be President Donald Trump’s decision a year ago to pull the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, embarking on a maximalist sanctions campaign against Tehran. In response, Iran’s supreme leader issued a veiled threat Tuesday, saying it wouldn’t be difficult for the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels.

The movement of diplomatic personnel is often done in times of conflict, but what is driving the decisions from the White House remains unclear. A high-ranking British general said there was no new threat from Iran or its regional proxies, something immediately rebutted by the U.S. military’s Central Command, which said its troops were on high alert, without elaborating.

Last week, U.S. officials said they had detected signs of Iranian preparations for potential attacks on U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East, but Washington has not spelled out that threat, and an alert on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said that all nonessential, nonemergency U.S. government staff were ordered to leave Iraq right away under State Department orders.

The U.S. in recent days has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Gulf region, plus four B-52 bombers.

Germany’s military said it was suspending training of Iraqi soldiers due to the tensions, although there was no specific threat to its own troops in Iraq. Defense Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff said Germany was “orienting itself toward our partner countries” though there are “no concrete warnings of attacks against German targets.”

German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer expressed concern over the tensions and said it welcomes “any measure that is aimed at a peaceful solution.” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said the German government has not reduced its embassy staff in Iraq or Iran.

In the Netherlands, state broadcaster NOS said its 50-person military mission in Iraq was halted “until further orders,” quoting a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying he couldn’t elaborate on the threats. It said the Dutch forces primarily train Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State militants.

The remarks about Iran’s nuclear program by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came Tuesday night in Tehran at an iftar, the traditional dinner Muslims have when breaking their daily fast during Ramadan. His comments first focused on playing down the risk of a wider conflict with America.

He told senior officials that his country won’t negotiate with the U.S., calling such talks “poison,” but he also said, “Neither we, nor them is seeking war. They know that it is not to their benefit,” according to the state-run IRAN newspaper.

Tehran is threatening to resume higher enrichment on July 7 if no new nuclear deal is in place, beyond the 3.67% permitted by the current deal between Tehran and world powers.

Iranian officials have said that they could reach 20% enrichment within four days. Though Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, scientists say the time needed to reach the 90% threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved once uranium is enriched to around 20%.

“Achieving 20% enrichment is the most difficult part,” Khamenei said, according to the newspaper. “The next steps are easier than this step.”

It was a telling remark from the supreme leader — Iran is not known to have enriched beyond 20% previously and it’s unclear how far Tehran is willing to go in this process. Khamenei has final say on all matters of state in Iran.

On Tuesday, Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels launched a coordinated drone attack on a critical oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia, Tehran’s biggest rival in the region. It was the latest incident to shake global energy markets, as authorities allege oil tankers anchored off the coast of the United Arab Emirates were targeted by sabotage. Benchmark Brent crude prices remained around $71 a barrel in early trading Wednesday.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are at war with Saudi Arabia and are believed by the West to receive weapons from Iran, said they launched seven drones targeting vital Saudi installations. That included two pumping stations along its critical East-West Pipeline, which can carry nearly 5 million barrels of crude a day to the Red Sea.

Saudi Aramco, the government-controlled oil company, said it temporarily shut down the pipeline and contained a fire, which caused minor damage to one pumping station. It added that Saudi Aramco’s oil and gas supplies were unaffected.

An image from San Francisco-based Planet Labs Inc. that The Associated Press examined Wednesday shows Saudi Aramco’s Pumping Station No. 8 outside of the town of al-Duadmi, 330 kilometers (205 miles) west of the kingdom’s capital, Riyadh.

The photo, taken after the attack, shows two black marks near where the East-West Pipeline passes by the facility — marks that weren’t in images from Monday. The facility otherwise appeared intact, corroborating in part Saudi Arabia’s earlier comments. The website TankerTrackers.com, whose analysts monitor oil sales on the seas, first reported about the black marks.

Details remain unclear around alleged acts of sabotage to four oil tankers, including two belonging to Saudi Arabia, off the coast of the UAE’s port of Fujairah. Satellite images seen by the AP from Colorado-based Maxar Technologies showed no visible damage to the vessels, and Gulf officials have refused to say who might be responsible.

The MT Andrea Victory, one of the alleged targets, sustained a hole in its hull just above its waterline from “an unknown object,” its owner Thome Ship Management said in a statement. Images of the Norwegian ship, which the company said was “not in any danger of sinking,” showed damage similar to what the firm described.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, has said the other three showed damage as well.

The unspecified threats reported by U.S. last week from Iran and its proxy forces in the region targeting Americans and American interests contradicted remarks by British Maj. Gen. Chris Ghika, a senior officer in the U.S.-backed coalition fighting the Islamic State group. He said Tuesday that “there’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.”

Later, in a rare public rebuttal of an allied military officer, U.S. Central Command said Ghika’s remarks “run counter to the identified credible threats” from Iranian-backed forces. In a statement, Central Command said the coalition in Baghdad has increased the alert level for all service members in Iraq and Syria.

Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question,https://www.politico.com,"['Caitlin Oprysko', 'Ted Hesson', 'Anita Kumar']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/13/census-citizenship-question-lawsuit-1318698,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies on the census during a House Oversight Committee hearing on March 14. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Legal Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question

A liberal watchdog group said Monday it plans to sue the Commerce Department to obtain records relating to Secretary Wilbur Ross’ “lies” about his decision to add a citizenship question to next year’s Census questionnaire.

Restore Public Trust said in a complaint filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it has filed several requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act that call into question Ross' justification for adding the citizenship question to the Census, and the group is demanding the release of those documents.

Story Continued Below

The question, which the Trump administration plans to include for the first time since 1950, is at the center of a legal battle that last month reached the Supreme Court. Civil rights groups and several local and state governments have sued the administration to have the question struck from next year’s survey, which is used to apportion congressional seats, Electoral College votes and billions in federal funding.

Restore Public Trust is suing for the release of a tranche of documents that the group says will show Ross was misleading in congressional testimony over how the question came to be added to the Census. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo that the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act.

But emails turned over as part of the lawsuits have showed that Ross was in contact with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about the question, and he had asked the Justice Department to request the question. The Commerce Department has defended Ross' testimony, arguing that the new communications only supplement the record.

The Commerce Department declined to comment Monday, citing pending litigation.

Researchers at the Census Bureau have said adding the question could result in depressed response rates among the Hispanic residents, a demographic that already sees lower rates of response to the decennial survey. Critics of the question have argued that the question is aimed at diluting the political power of Democratic-leaning areas home to Hispanic communities. Separately, Commerce has been accused of violating administrative procedure and adding the question without proper vetting of its potential effect on Census responses.

The lawsuit filed Monday cites three FOIA requests submitted by the group last December and on April 12 seeking communications regarding the Census, including emails sent or received by Ross and some of his top current and former aides, as well as Kobach and Census Bureau and DOJ officials, relating to the Census.

According to the group, they have received no communication from the Commerce Department concerning their requests, even though FOIA requires agencies to respond within 20 days or provide notice that their response will be delayed. The document requests are likely to overlap with those the House Oversight Committee voted last month to subpoena from the Commerce Department.

“The American people have a right to know what Secretary Ross and the rest of Trump’s political appointees discussed behind closed doors as they devised a scheme to make the census less representative for all Americans,” said Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to Restore Public Trust. “Even more disturbing than Secretary Ross’s attempts to avoid public scrutiny is his apparent lies to Congress and evasion of Congressional oversight.”

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case last month and appears poised to side with Ross, overturning the ruling of lower courts and letting the citizenship question stand. DOJ has said in court filings that the Census Bureau must finalize printed questionnaires by the end of next month to meet production deadlines.

Amid the legal drama over the citizenship question last month, Ross also caught flak for rejecting two invitations from House and Senate appropriators to testify before their committees about his agency's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, saying his appearance would be a distraction and offering to send other officials from the department.

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

REUTERS/Joshua Lott

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has to date paid out $8.52 billion in direct payments to American farmers as part of the 2018 aid program, designed to offset losses from trade tariffs by China and other trading partners, a spokesman for the agency said.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year pledged up to $12 billion in aid to farmers, a key constituency, to help offset losses due to Chinese tariffs imposed in response to Washington’s levies on Chinese goods.

A USDA spokesperson said the department had as of Wednesday paid out a total of $8.52 billion in direct payments, one portion of a wider trade mitigation program which also includes support up to $1.2 billion through commodity purchases and $200 million allocated to developing foreign markets.

The top five commodities that received aid were soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum while the top five states receiving the payments were Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana, the USDA spokesman said.

Farmers have complained about the slow pace of the rollout of aid payments, which were hit by a month-long partial government shutdown that ended earlier this year. Floods in the Midwest coupled with a lingering trade dispute with China and tumbling commodity prices have hit them hard.

China has zeroed in on U.S. farmers with tariffs after Trump imposed duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods last year as part of his vow to cut the U.S. trade deficit with China. Beijing slapped a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans in retaliation. That effectively shut down U.S. soybean exports to China, worth around $12 billion last year.

With no quick end to the trade war in sight, particularly after the latest round of talks between Beijing and Washington last week ended with no progress, the Trump administration is now working on a second aid program to support farmers."
House Democrats reject Trump's proposed 31% EPA budget cut,https://www.cnn.com,['Clare Foran'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/house-democrats-epa-budget-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Democrats are sending a message that they view deep budget cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency as a non-starter, setting down another marker for future spending battles with the White House in the months ahead.

The Democrat-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday released a draft funding bill for Interior, Environment and related agencies for fiscal year 2020 that rejects proposed cuts at EPA outlined in President Donald Trump's most recent budget.

Trump's budget proposa l called for cutting EPA funding by 31% -- bringing it down to $6.1 billion from its fiscal year 2019 level of roughly $8.8 billion. The House funding bill released on Tuesday calls for EPA to be funded at a level of $9.52 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase over both the current level and the President's budget request.

Presidential budgets are largely messaging documents and the House bill is an opening bid in an annual appropriations process that won't be completed for months and will ultimately require House and Senate negotiators to come together to find common ground.

The House bill will be subject to changes as soon as Wednesday when it is taken up for consideration in a subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet released its version of the Interior and Environment funding bill for fiscal year 2020.

""The totality of barriers to accessing and communicating with attorneys endured by detainees in these prisons deprives SPLC’s clients of their constitutional rights to access courts, to access counsel, and to obtain full and fair hearings, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,"" the suit argues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it banned six Chinese technology entities, one Pakistani firm and five based in the United Arab Emirates from exporting sensitive U.S. technologies and other goods.

In a statement, the Commerce Department said four of the Chinese firms, also with offices in Hong Kong, attempted to procure U.S.-origin commodities that would have supported Iran’s weapons of mass destruction and military programs in violation of U.S. export controls.

The Commerce Department said two other Chinese firms were added to the banned “Entities List” because they participated in the export of controlled technology, which was then supplied to organizations affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army.

The export bans come as the United States and China have escalated their trade war following difficult negotiations last week. The United States has increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, while China has raised tariffs on a target list of $60 billion in U.S. imports

The banned Chinese entities are Avin Electronics Technology Co Ltd, based in Shenzhen; Longkui Qu of Linhai, Zhejiang province; Multi-Mart Electronics Technology Co of Nanhai, Guangdong province; Taizhou CBM-Future New Material Science and Technology Co Ltd of Linhai, Zhejiang province; Tenco Technology Co Ltd, Shenzhen; and Yutron Technology Co Ltd of Shenzhen.

Avin, Mult-Mart, Tenco and Yutron all have offices in Hong Kong, Commerce said.

“We are putting individuals, businesses, and organizations across the world on notice that they will be held accountable for supporting Iran’s WMD activities and other illicit schemes,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “Moreover, we cannot allow China’s civil-military integration strategy to undermine U.S. national security through prohibited technology transfer plots orchestrated by state actors.”"

For the Level 4 Advisory, The Department of State sites the rise of terror groups in the area that are active and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. They added Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq.

With the U.S. government’s ability to provide essential emergency services to U.S. citizens very limited, the State Department has also ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil; normal visa services will be temporarily suspended at both posts.

Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are also reportedly an issue across the country.

The Department of State added in the travel advisory that U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion).

Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

DOJ tries to disqualify ex-Obama official from defending China’s Huawei,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Bebeto Matthews'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei,"The Justice Department is working to disqualify top Obama department official James Cole from defending the Chinese technology firm Huawei in a high-profile criminal case, according to a new heavily redacted federal court filing on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Huawei in January 2019 which charged the company with bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering, obstruction of justice, illegal actions related to dodging Iran sanctions, and more. Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2015, has been representing Huawei in this matter since 2017, but the Justice Department’s motion is an attempt to convince the court that Cole’s previous experiences investigating Huawei-related matters while at the department should disqualify him.

Cole held the second-highest position in the Obama Justice Department for five years, where he worked with Attorney General Eric Holder, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the department, and represented the department on the National Security Council. He brought those experiences to Sidley, one of the largest law firms in the country, where he is the global co-lead of their White Collar: Government Litigation and Investigations practice and where he has defended Huawei for the past couple years.

Justice Department attorneys told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York that “Cole should be disqualified from representing Huawei Tech and Huawei USA in this case because of two different conflicts.” The details the department provided on the first conflict were heavily redacted. The agency said that “having represented the government in his role as DAG in the DOJ's [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED], Cole should not now be allowed to represent the defendants in a [REDACTED] matter brought by the DOJ that is substantially related in multiple respects to that [REDACTED] investigation.” Therefore, the department said that “Cole should be disqualified because he was personally and substantially involved in a [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED] that exposed him to relevant, privileged factual information [REDACTED] and strategic information about that investigation.”

The Justice Department did not specify those prior investigations.

The agency said the second conflict is that “Cole's representation of the defendants jeopardizes the government's interest in having a fair trial and obtaining a conviction that can sustain appeal and collateral attack.” Their claim was that, due to Cole’s past involvement in Justice Department investigations related to the Huawei case, he would not be able to provide Huawei with a proper defense and that “any representation by Cole would taint the trial process and any ultimate conviction.”

The Justice Department met with Cole related to his alleged conflict of interest multiple times in January and February 2019. Cole declined to recuse himself in March 2019, stating, “We have carefully considered the material you showed us and were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified based on that information.”

For its part, Huawei released a statement saying the Justice Department “has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter” and that its motion “makes a mockery of the adversarial process.” Huawei says that this is an attempt by the department “to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice … while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The Justice Department has been increasing its scrutiny of China’s activities in recent years, launching a ""China Initiative"" in 2018 and charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. The department has turned its sights on Huawei’s alleged criminality: Aside from charging the company and its connected entities, the U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Wanzhou Meng, who the U.S. believes was involved in the criminal conspiracy.

The U.S. government widely suspects that the Chinese-based Huawei, a technology firm that is a global leader in telecommunications and in 5G, is working hand in hand with the Chinese government, giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Discussing the U.S.’s intelligence-sharing relationships with the United Kingdom and other European allies who are considering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned, “We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network. We’re happy to continue to look at technology and see ways we might achieve that, but the United States for its part will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China or China’s government.”

The Department of Defense’s annual report to Congress on China, released in May, stressed that China is a growing threat not just in terms of hard power military capabilities but also in terms of cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration. The Defense Department pointed out that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

Cole is not the only former high-ranking Obama official representing China-based Huawei’s interests. Samir Jain, who was the senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, registered as a lobbyist for Huawei earlier this year.

DHS asks military for more help dealing with influx of migrants,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Ryan Browne']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/12/politics/homeland-security-military-immigration/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military for more help as it deals with the influx of migrants coming into the US, including tents for large numbers of them, two US administration officials told CNN.

One official said the DHS request was for single occupancy units.

The request, which was delivered to the Pentagon Friday night, came as Customs and Border Protection predicted it would surpass half a million migrants crossing the border so far this fiscal year. The number of apprehensions on the US-Mexico border is the highest since 2009

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is considering the request.

""Secretary Shanahan is committed to increasing support to DHS where appropriate to do so,"" his spokesman, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday unveiled a probe of the Trump administration’s moves to curtail the federal government’s role in scrutinizing police shootings.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Chairman Jerrold Nadler and other committee Democrats requested documents and updates on how the Justice Department has addressed shootings and other cases of excessive police force since President Donald Trump took office in early 2017.

The lawmakers cited statistics, including media reports, that show nearly 1,000 people were shot and killed by police in 2018 and that at least 265 others have met with the same fate this year. The numbers include cases of unarmed shooting victims that have drawn international criticism.

“Despite continuing concerns from civil rights and community-based organizations, the department has sharply curtailed its statutory role in identifying and eradicating civil rights abuses by law enforcement,” the lawmakers’ letter said. Justice Department officials were not immediately available to comment.

Among the documents sought by the Democratic lawmakers are memos written by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who implemented policies that critics say sharply curtailed the ability of Justice Department civil rights attorneys to rein in unconstitutional policing.

The lawmakers gave Barr until June 5 to comply with their request."
