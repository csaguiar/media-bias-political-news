"The Supreme Court could intervene in attempt to remove Trump from office, Dershowitz says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-intervene-trump-office-dershowitz,"President Trump may succeed if he follows through on his attempt to take an impeachment attempt to the Supreme Court, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said on Friday.

""Our non-lawyer president may be closer to the truth than his lawyer critics,"" Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed published in The Hill.

Dershowitz, a Fox News contributor, was referring to responses to the president's tweet that he would take the issue to the nation's highest court.

""I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Trump said in April.

ANDREW MCCARTHY: MUELLER PROBE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT

Dershowitz, in his Friday op-ed, pointed to previous Supreme Court justices who indicated that the Supreme Court should intervene under certain circumstances.

“Finally, as applied to the special case of the President, the majority argument merely points out that, were the Senate to convict the President without any kind of trial, a Constitutional crisis might well result,"" former Supreme Court Justice Byron White said.

""It hardly follows that the Court ought to refrain from upholding the Constitution in all impeachment cases. Nor does it follow that, in cases of presidential impeachment, the Justices ought to abandon their constitutional responsibility because the Senate has precipitated a crisis.""

Dershowitz also knocked people for criticizing Trump's willingness to go to raise the prospect of a Supreme Court challenge.

CHAD PERGRAM: DEMOCRATS 'NOWHERE NEAR' THE AMOUNT OF VOTES THEY NEED FOR IMPEACHMENT

""No one should criticize President Trump for raising the possibility of Supreme Court review, especially following Bush v. Gore, the case that ended the 2000 election,"" he said. ""Many of the same academics ridiculed the notion that the justices would enter the political thicket of vote-counting.""

Dershowitz's op-ed came as media outlets amplified questions surrounding potential impeachment. While some in Congress supported that move, many didn't.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who presides over the chamber responsible for impeachment -- has repeatedly pushed back on impeachment and, on Thursday, argued it could ultimately prevent an effective prosecution against the president.

Many have speculated that impeachment could spell trouble for Democrats in 2020, but some progressives, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have argued that certain issues transcended politics.

Meanwhile, congressional Democrats continued pressing the administration for more information surrounding the Russia investigation -- coming up against the Trump administration's refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas."
Mexican president hints at migration concessions to avoid Trump tariffs,https://www.cnbc.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/01/mexican-president-hints-at-migration-concessions-to-defuse-trade-spat.html,"Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador speaks during his morning press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, on May 31, 2019.

Mexico's president on Saturday hinted his country could tighten migration controls to defuse U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods, and said he expected ""good results"" from talks planned in Washington next week.

Trump said on Thursday he will apply the tariffs on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration, largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border.

His ultimatum hit Mexican financial assets and global stocks, but met resistance from U.S. business leaders and lawmakers worried about the impact of targeting Mexico, one of the United States' top trade partners.

In a news conference in the Gulf of Mexico port of Veracruz, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico could be ready to step up measures to contain migration in order to reach a deal with the United States.

A Mexican delegation led by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard will discuss the dispute with U.S. officials in Washington on Wednesday, and Lopez Obrador said he expected ""good results"" from the talks, and for a deal to emerge.

""The main thing is to inform about what we're already doing on the migration issue, and if it's necessary to reinforce these measures without violating human rights, we could be prepared to reach that deal,"" Lopez Obrador said.

Trump's threat to inflict pain on Mexico's economy is the biggest foreign policy test to date for Lopez Obrador and a tall order for Mexican authorities struggling not only to contain migration but also to fight record gang violence.

Mexico's economy relies heavily on exports to the United States and shrank in the first quarter. Under Trump's plan, U.S. tariffs that could rise as high as 25% this year.

Lopez Obrador said Mexico would not engage in any trade wars with the United States, but noted that his government had a ""plan"" in case Trump did apply the tariffs to ensure the country was not impoverished. He did not provide details of the plan."

Navy confirms request to ‘minimize’ USS John McCain during Trump visit to Japan,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/navy-confirms-request-to-minimize-uss-john-mccain-during-trump-visit-to-japan,"The Navy on Saturday confirmed that a request was made to “minimize the visibility” of the U.S.S. John McCain during President Trump’s recent visit to Japan -- but that it remained in a “normal configuration” during the visit.

""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement to Politico.

TRUMP, DEFENSE BOSS SHANAHAN BOTH DENY LINK TO USS JOHN S MCCAIN 'OUT OF SIGHT' DIRECTIVE

The statement said that there were “no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the White House had requested the Navy move the warship “out of sight” ahead of Trump’s state visit.

The outlet cited a May 15 email from a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials that said: “USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.” After the officials expressed surprise, the official said he would talk to the White House Military Office to get more information about the order. The Journal also reported that a tarp was hung over the ship’s name ahead of the visit and sailors were directed to remove any coverings from the ship with its name on it.

McCain, a former Arizona senator and military veteran, had a years-long feud with Trump before his death from brain cancer last year. But Trump has kept that feud going even since McCain’s death, particularly his anger at McCain casting the decisive vote against Republican efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare in 2017.

In March Trump complained at a rally that he ""endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted...but I didn’t get a thank you.”

“I never liked him much,” Trump said. “I really probably never will.”

The warship was commissioned in 1994 and originally named for the senator's father and grandfather, both Navy admirals named John Sidney McCain. Last year, the Navy rededicated the ship to honor Sen. McCain.

According to the Journal, sailors on the ship were given the day off and a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. But a spokesman told the Journal that the tarp was taken down and the barge removed before the presidential visit.

TRUMP SAYS NOT INVOLVED WITH KEEPING MCCAIN SHIP OUT OF VIEW

Both Trump and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan have denied knowing anything about any such orders. Trump told reporters Thursday that while he was not “a big fan” of McCain, “I would never do a thing like that.”

""Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK? And they were well-meaning, I will say,"" he said.

“Secretary Shanahan was not aware of the directive to move the USS John S McCain nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive,” a spokesman for Shanahan said in a statement.

In his statement Saturday, Brown said the Navy is “fully cooperating” with a review fo the matter tasked by the Pentagon.

Trump’s Middle East Peace Plan Faces a Crossroads After Coalition Talks in Israel Crumble,https://www.nytimes.com,['Mark Landler'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/politics/trump-middle-east-peace-israel.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to throw his full weight behind Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign to save his job as prime minister of Israel. But to do that, analysts and former diplomats said, the president will have to sacrifice any last hopes of proposing a peace plan that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.

Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss the status of the plan on Thursday, hours after the prime minister failed to form a governing coalition. Mr. Kushner emerged with a longer timetable and a narrower diplomatic mission, these people said.

Rather than make concessions to the Palestinians, Mr. Kushner will be under pressure to tilt the plan ever further in Israel’s favor. Far from being a bold effort to break decades of enmity between the two sides, it could end up becoming a vehicle to resurrect Mr. Netanyahu’s political fortunes and to protect Mr. Trump’s.

The plan, which Mr. Kushner has drafted under a veil of secrecy for more than two years, was already looking like a doomed effort. Though its details remain unknown, Mr. Kushner has suggested it will not call for the creation of a Palestinian state, jettisoning decades of American policy toward the conflict. The Palestinians have vowed to reject it out of hand, branding it a blueprint for Israeli domination."
Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

Justice Department Is Reportedly Looking Into an Antitrust Investigation Into Google,https://gizmodo.com,"['Catie Keck', 'About The Author', 'Staff Reporter']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/justice-department-is-reportedly-looking-into-an-antitr-1835175063,"Photo: AP

The Justice Department may be preparing to launch an antitrust investigation into Google, according to reports.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the department has been in talks with the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust task force about launching a probe into the tech giant’s search and business operations. Following discussions over which should proceed with a new antitrust investigation—the FTC previously investigated Google but closed the case in 2013—the Journal said the two have agreed to the Justice Department leading any new probe into the company.

Separately, the New York Times also reported on the investigation, though the paper’s report hedged slightly by stating that the Justice Department was “exploring” a probe rather than preparing one. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Times reported that the trade commission has recently directed complaints about the company to the Justice Department. According to the Journal, officials with the department have already spoken with some of these parties.

A spokesperson for Google did not immediately return a request for comment about the report. Neither the Justice Department nor the FTC returned comment requests.

According to the Times, the potential probe comes after the FTC’s antitrust task force began looking into Google’s ad and search practices. The task force, announced in February, was established to investigate possible anticompetitive conduct among tech companies. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement at the time that “it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”

“Our ongoing Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century are a crucial step to deepen our understanding of these markets and potential competitive issues. The Technology Task Force is the next step in that effort,” he added.

The reported probe would come as tech monopolies face increasingly louder condemnation from political critics who claim that they wield far too much power and engage in anticompetitive tactics by either gobbling up competitors or crushing their business. (The company has faced billions in fines from European regulators over antitrust abuses.) Chief among these critics in the U.S. is Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who has called for breaking up Facebook, Google, and Amazon—tech giants she says have “too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.”

“I want a government that makes sure everybody — even the biggest and most powerful companies in America — plays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish,” she said in March. “To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.”"
State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."
"William Barr vs. Robert Mueller, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/1/18647362/mueller-barr-trump-obstruction-law,"Major disagreements between Robert Mueller and Attorney General William Barr have spilled out into public this week, with the dispute focusing on the handling of the investigation of President Trump for potential obstruction of justice.

On Wednesday, Mueller announced his resignation and made his first-ever public statement on the investigation, giving a summary of his conclusions that was conspicuously different from Barr’s. After that, Barr responded, defending his own decisions in an hour-long interview with CBS This Morning.

Discrepancies between Barr and Mueller have simmered for some time. Barr’s initial letter describing Mueller’s findings gave a starkly incomplete picture that seemed much rosier for Trump than the full report. And he has since adopted Trump’s line that the investigation found “there was in fact no collusion.” (Mueller says there was “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.”)

But the heart of the current dispute relates to the highly unusual way the obstruction investigation wrapped up — with Mueller deciding not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump broke the law, and with Barr then deciding to reach the conclusion that he didn’t.

Barr is now taking aim at several of Mueller’s choices. He says Mueller “could’ve reached a decision” on whether Trump committed crimes. He says he disagrees with Mueller’s application of obstruction statutes to certain of Trump’s acts. And he says that even if you accept Mueller’s interpretation of obstruction law, the evidence against Trump was “deficient” in every single episode.

What Mueller did

Tasked with investigating President Trump for potentially attempting to obstruct the Russia investigation, Mueller conducted a thorough investigation into 11 particular “episodes” involving the president (including the firing of James Comey as FBI director, Trump’s conduct toward witnesses like Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, and Trump’s attempts to dismiss Mueller himself).

But Mueller also determined that he could not indict a sitting president because of existing Justice Department policy. “Charging the President with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,” he said this week.

Still: even if Mueller couldn’t charge Trump, it seemed at least possible that he would wrap up his investigation with a judgment on whether the president broke the law.

So it came as a surprise to many when he chose not to do that. “We concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said Wednesday. In part, his report explains, this is because it would be unfair to accuse the president of a crime when he can’t be charged and have the opportunity to clear his name at trial.

What Mueller did instead was lay out evidence and analysis about each of the potentially obstructive episodes involving Trump. Specifically, he examined whether Trump’s actions in each case met three elements common to obstruction statutes: 1) whether they were obstructive acts, 2) whether they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and 3) whether there was corrupt intent.

Often, Mueller’s analysis seemed quite damning. For some of the episodes, he said there was “substantial” evidence that all three of those elements applied; for others, his assessment was more mixed. But he never took the final step of clearly saying Trump broke the law or committed a crime in any instance.

Yet in one last twist, Mueller also said that if he had “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” he would say so — and that he is “unable to reach that judgment.” So he implied that, at the very least, Trump’s conduct wasn’t obviously innocent.

What Barr did

As Mueller was wrapping up his work in March, he informed the Justice Department and its new attorney general, Barr, that he wouldn’t reach a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Barr has testified that he was “frankly surprised” to hear this, and he told CBS this week that he didn’t agree with that call. “He could’ve reached a conclusion. The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity,” Barr said.

Then Mueller may have been surprised at what Barr did next — he decided to step into the void and issue his own conclusion on Trump’s conduct.

Barr says he worked with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other Justice Department lawyers on this, and that there were two parts to their analysis.

First, he says, he offered up a different interpretation of how the obstruction statutes could be applied to Trump’s actions.

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis — a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law,” he told CBS.

Barr said that, for instance, the president’s firing of an FBI director is a “facially valid exercise of core presidential authority,” so the obstruction of justice statutes shouldn’t apply to it. (He made a similar argument last year in a memo before he got the attorney general job.)

Second, though, he says, he didn’t just “rely on” his team’s alternate interpretation of how the obstruction statutes should be applied — he also examined whether, under Mueller’s interpretation of the obstruction laws, Trump’s actions in any instance satisfied all three elements of the statute (that they were obstructive acts, that they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and that they were done with corrupt intent).

For every single one, Barr said, “we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction.”

It’s certainly a convenient conclusion for Trump. And it’s curious that we actually haven’t seen any of Barr’s analysis on these topics, beyond his brief letter to Congress.

What are Barr’s responses to the seemingly damning analysis Mueller gave about certain episodes? Did he in fact think “long and hard” about it and seriously study Mueller’s evidence and arguments? Or was it more of a hasty “nothing to see here” whitewash?

How can a president be held accountable for lawbreaking?

Looming over all this are the tremendously important issues of what is to be done when the president of the United States may have committed criminal wrongdoing — and whether the president is in fact above the law.

Currently, there’s no easy answer to this within the US government. The Justice Department, which is charged with investigating and enforcing federal law, is to at least some extent subordinate to the president and run by his appointees. And DOJ has taken the position that it cannot indict a sitting president.

Congress, meanwhile, has the constitutional authority to impeach and remove a president. But it doesn’t really have the ability or expertise to conduct a serious criminal investigation.

Now, Mueller’s role as a Justice Department special counsel required him to submit “a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached” to the attorney general (not to Congress).

Still, some have speculated that Mueller may have truly intended his report for Congress to act on. Under this interpretation, Mueller gathered facts and did the analysis, but one reason for his refusal to take the final step and say that Trump’s conduct was criminal was because he believed that was Congress’s job.

Mueller has never outright said he intended any such thing. But in his remarks Wednesday, the special counsel did mention how “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.”

Barr, however, recoiled at this very concept “The Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress,” he told CBS. “Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process. We are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers.”

And these arguments aren’t baseless. Mueller had no actual obligation or authority under the law to give his final report to Congress, and certainly not to make an impeachment referral. Barr’s critique is that Mueller was a Justice Department special counsel investigating violations of federal criminal law. And the impeachment process has nothing to do with federal criminal law. So why should the special counsel be involved in it?

In any case, Barr did choose to release the report anyway, and Congress now has the ability to decide how it wants to proceed. But the question remains: What should the Justice Department do when it thinks the president may have violated federal criminal law? This whole messy process hasn’t resulted in any clear answer."
'Bare minimum': Britain decides no palace stay or parliamentary speech for Trump in low-key state visit,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bare-minimum-britain-decides-no-palace-stay-or-parliamentary-speech-for-trump-in-low-key-state-visit,"Opening his speech to British parliamentarians in 2011, President Barack Obama said, “I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall.""

It is an honor that will not be extended to President Trump next week during his first state visit to Britain, one of a number of differences from the trips made by his predecessors.

British and American officials have played down concerns about protests and insist that Trump is being afforded every bit of the usual hospitality — from dinner with the queen to bilateral talks with Theresa May, the prime minister.

But royal watchers said the Trumps will be missing out on many of the trappings of a state visit, such as staying at Buckingham Palace. “Not being invited to speak before Parliament is testament to the fact they know he is going to be rude and there’s going to be massive protests,"" said Marlene Koenig, an author and expert on British and European royalty.

“They are doing the bare minimum of what they would do for a state visit of a major ally.""

Rather than stayinhg with the Queen, Trump will be put up at Winfield House, residence of Woody Johnson, the United States ambassador to the Court of St James's. Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, was appointed by Trump. Winfield House, a neo-Georgian manion in Regent's Park, has the advantage of being set in 12 acres of grounds, safely away from demonstrators.

Several honors afforded visiting American presidents or other heads of state will be missing.

He will not get the usual welcome in Horse Guards Parade, the grand parade ground in central London where visiting heads of state are usually invited to inspect the honor guard with the queen before a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace.

Instead, he will follow the example of President George W. Bush, who was given his royal welcome in the garden of Buckingham Palace in 2003 because of fears protesters would line the route through London. There, Trump will inspect the guard of honor, comprising the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards, with Prince Charles.

The reception stands in contrast to the visit of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Then, some half a million cheering people gathered simply to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie.

Trump will not get to stay at Buckingham Palace with the Queen. Both Bush and Obama, the only two American presidents to have been granted official state visits, stayed at the royal residence, but Trump has been told that renovations to the east wing of the palace meant its guest rooms were out of service.

American officials were eager to play down any hint of a snub and said the timing of the visit — to coincide with the 75th anniversary of D-Day — illustrated the strong bonds between the two countries. “It gives evidence to the fact that the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. is real and enduring,” said a senior administration official. “As the president himself has said, ‘It's a bond like no other.’”

The run-up to this visit featured speculation about whether Trump would be invited to address the British Parliament.

In the end, the speaker — the figure who presides over the House of Commons and who had previously said Trump’s attendance would run counter to Parliament’s longstanding opposition to sexism and racism — said he had not been asked by British officials to host the president. Presidents Obama, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton all addressed Parliament.

A U.K. official said Trump had not requested to address Parliament. ""The president not asking to do that is the norm,"" he said. On both sides of the Atlantic, a mutually-convenient cover story of Trump not being asked to be invited in order to avoid being told he will not be invited appears to have been adopted.

But protesters say they can already claim a victory in ensuring Trump will not address MPs and Lords.

“Our voices are being heard,” said Mohammed Ateek, a Syrian refugee and a spokesman for the Stop Trump Coalition. “What a shame if they had allowed him to address Parliament, which stands up for democracy.

“We contributed to this because if there were no voices being raised against Trump, then they would have said, why not?”

Previous visits have sometimes reflected the warm relations between individual leaders.

In 1982 the queen invited Ronald Reagan to stay with her at Windsor Castle and took him horse riding. A decade late, Bill and Hillary Clinton were treated to a night aboard the royal yacht Britannia.

And in 2011, Obama grilled sausages with David Cameron in the garden of Number 10 during an event for British and American service personnel."

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."
US Now Seeking Social Media Details From All Visa Applicants,https://lex18.com,['Associated Press'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://lex18.com/news/2019/06/01/us-now-seeking-social-media-details-from-all-visa-applicants/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers.

It’s a vast expansion of the Trump administration’s enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that’s just taken effect, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms to request the additional information from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who’d traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations."

"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""
DOJ rebuffs judge's order to release transcripts of Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian envoy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-rebuffs-judges-order-to-release-transcripts-of-michael-flynns-conversations-with-russian-envoy,"The Justice Department rejected a federal judge's order to release the transcripts of wiretapped conversations retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had with a Russian envoy.

Prosecutors also declined to produced unredacted portions of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report that had to do with Flynn, who assisted Trump's 2016 campaign and briefly served as national security adviser in 2017.

Little explanation was given beyond stating that the materials were not relevant to Flynn's sentencing.

“The government further represents that it is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing Friday in response to an order by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about his communications with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which were about sanctions during the transition before Trump took office, and reached a plea deal to cooperate with Mueller's team. Flynn has yet to be sentenced and is still working with Justice Department prosecutors in a criminal case against Bijan Kian, his former lobbying partner who worked for the Turkish government.

The Justice Department did comply with Sullivan's order to release a transcript of a Nov. 22, 2017, voicemail that former Trump lawyer John Dowd left for Flynn's lawyer Rob Kelner shortly after Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller."
Border Patrol holding 900 at facility fit for 125 in situation that ‘could turn violent’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,"['U.S. Department Of Homeland Security', 'Office Of Inspector General']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-holding-900-at-facility-fit-for-125-in-situation-that-could-turn-violent,"A government watchdog is warning of a potentially “violent” situation at one Border Patrol station on the U.S.-Mexico border where migrants are held in unsafe conditions. Even so, Homeland Security officials are not planning changes anytime soon.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report Friday that found “dangerous overcrowding” among adults being held at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas.

During an unannounced trip to the border May 7 to 8, Inspector General Office workers observed 900 people being held at a facility where the maximum capacity is 125 people.

Inspectors peered into cells and found 76 people in one fit for a dozen people. Another cell suitable for eight people held 41. A third cell with capacity for 35 was holding 155 people.

“Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks,” the inspector general report states.

CBP’s 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search standards state that “under no circumstances should the maximum occupancy rate, as set by the fire marshal, be exceeded.”

The report revealed that not only were people being held in overcrowded conditions, they were also being held far longer than Border Patrol policy states detainees can be held before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“According to Border Patrol’s custody logs, there were 756 detainees on site when we visited PDT on May 7, 2019. Of those, 502 detainees (66 percent) had been held at PDT for longer than 72 hours [the limit outlined in TEDS], with 33 detainees (4 percent) held there for more than two weeks,” the report states.

CBP said hygiene conditions have sunk because detainees do not have adequate access to showers and clean clothing. Some men and women had been in “soiled clothing for days or weeks.” Because of the overcrowded cells, some were standing on toilets, making it difficult or impossible to use those facilities.

“We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety not just of the detainees, but also DHS agents and officers. Border Patrol management on site said there is a high incidence of illness among their staff,” the report states. “In addition, Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent.”

An unspecified number of Border Patrol agents have opted to retire early while others were looking at leaving their jobs.

Agents at the station told the inspectors they called ICE on a daily basis hoping new beds would be available so that some detainees could be transferred out of the agency’s custody.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General

The El Paso Border Patrol sector is one of nine on the southern border. Since the start of fiscal 2019 in October, the region has seen the second-highest number of families illegally crossing: 98,052. That figure is up 1,816% from the same time the previous year.

The inspector general’s office said it informed acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about its concerns and was unsatisfied with his department’s response. DHS said it is building a tent near the facility that will be able to hold 500 people by July 31.

“We observed conditions at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT) Border Patrol facility that represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of detainees and DHS employees … Dangerous overcrowding among single adults in PDT requires immediate action,” inspectors wrote."
State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

Interested in LGBT? Add LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."

Ron Wyden said the Treasury Department's response to congressional requests for the president's tax returns was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.” | AP Photo/Cliff Owen finance & tax Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance

Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.

Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.

In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.

Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.

Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December.

"Justice Dept. Keeps Wiretaps Secret in Flynn Case, Rejecting Judge’s Order",https://www.nytimes.com,['Adam Goldman'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/us/politics/flynn-kislyak-wiretap.html,"WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors rebuffed a judge’s order to release by Friday highly classified transcripts of discussions that Michael T. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.

The transcripts between Mr. Flynn and Sergey I. Kislyak, formerly Russia’s top diplomat in the United States, were expected to show that they talked in December 2016 about sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia. Mr. Flynn initially denied those exchanges about sanctions both to Trump administration officials and the F.B.I. in the weeks after the discussions.

The conversations prompted concerns among senior Obama administration officials about whether the Trump transition team was flouting norms about holding off on making policy until after taking office. The phone calls were also at the center of the scandal that eventually prompted Mr. Flynn’s ouster just weeks into President Trump’s term.

The order this month from the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia, was unusual. The transcripts came from a secret F.B.I. wiretap of Mr. Kislyak, and their release would have provided an extraordinarily rare look at the fruits of the government’s eavesdropping. Agents routinely listen to wiretaps of foreign officials, but they remain among the government’s most closely held secrets."
US Border Patrol to train in Guatemala,https://www.ktvz.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.ktvz.com/news/politics/us-border-patrol-to-train-in-guatemala/1082751508,"Getty Images US Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers will be sent to Guatemala to assist in training missions with local authorities as part of a two-year plan aimed at decreasing migration flows to the United States.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - US Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers will be sent to Guatemala to assist in training missions with local authorities as part of a two-year plan aimed at decreasing migration flows to the United States.

Agents will be ""side-by-side"" with local Guatemalan authorities, deployed to locations where US law enforcement has not traditionally operated, according to a senior DHS official.

This is a unique surge of DHS personnel to Guatemala, with a ""significant increase"" in US law enforcement presence in the country, said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The deployment of DHS officers follows an agreement signed earlier this week between the US and Guatemalan governments. It comes as the administration is trying to find a way to stem the influx of migrant families, mostly from Central America, through Mexico to the US.

The number of migrants illegally crossing the the southern US border has been on a steady upswing, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in US holding facilities at the border. The month of May is on pace to have the highest number of border crossings in over 12 years, according to McAleenan.

""We've invested in a continuing presence in Central America for several years now. What's different about this agreement is the direct operational partnership"" with the government of Guatemala, McAleenan said while in the country for a wide-ranging visit that included signing the memorandum of cooperation to implement the program.

In addition to US Border Patrol agents, personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations and Enforcement and Removal Operations divisions will deploy, according to a DHS official based in the region.

Early Wednesday morning, Homeland Security Investigations agents participated in a raid led by the Guatemalan police to take down an alleged criminal organization, in what was considered the first cooperative operation carried out after the agreement was signed. Similar operations have taken place in the past, but ""never with this kind of support"" from US and local governments, said a DHS official.

The official described the increase in law enforcement support as one ""piece"" of the effort to address illegal migration and security issues, which also includes nongovernmental organizations and other support.

""There's not one solution to this whole problem,"" said the official. ""We're improving the security side of the house.""

US Border Patrol agents will assist with training on port-of-entry operations as well as internal checkpoints within Guatemala. Other US investigators will help with anti-human-smuggling efforts, such as determining how organizations are profiting from smuggling and how they are moving money, according to the senior official.

Agents will be deployed to Guatemala from both the southern and northern US borders, confirmed McAleenan.

Timing and details on how many agents would be deployed were not immediately available.

The Washington Post has also reported on details of the deployment.

DHS personnel are already spread thin. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees Border Patrol, has ongoing struggles with attrition in its workforce and has already shifted resources to deal with the swell of migrants at the US-Mexico border. In addition, DHS has called on volunteers from throughout the department to assist in the border mission. More than 200 employees have already volunteered to go to the border.

When asked about diverting resources when Border Patrol is already short-staffed, McAleenan said, ""We're going to try and interdict this flow where it starts.""

He added that it is being done in an effort to increase the capacity of international partners and ""address threats at the earliest possible point.""

Another DHS official told CNN that resistance to giving up personnel for the international mission could be expected, but it's worth it because agents will serve as a ""force multiplier.""

Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."
"William Barr dishes on what Huber, Horowitz, and Durham are investigating",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-barr-dishes-on-what-huber-horowitz-and-durham-are-investigating,"Attorney General William Barr gave his clearest explanation yet of the various “investigations of the investigators” being carried out by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS’s Jan Crawford, Barr described what tasks U.S. Attorney John Durham, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber have been assigned regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the DOJ and FBI as they carried it out.

Following pressure from congressional Republicans, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in March 2018 that Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah, had been picked to review any misconduct by the DOJ and FBI. Some Republicans had been calling for a second special counsel.

Huber’s long-running inquiry has long been shrouded in mystery, but Barr revealed Horowitz and Durham have taken over most of his responsibilities.

Barr said “Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance” but that he then “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review.”

Barr said Huber “was essentially on standby” in the event that Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.” That apparently has not been necessary, as Barr said “he has not been active on this front in recent months.” Barr said Durham would now be taking over Huber’s role in handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz and Huber’s involvement with Trump-Russia matters was done.

Sessions had also asked Huber in 2017 to look into issues related to the sale of Uranium One and allegations that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been improperly involved in the process, as well as broader claims of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. Barr seemed to suggest that what evidence Huber found, if any, may soon be revealed.

""The other issues [Huber has] been working on relate to Hillary Clinton” are ""winding down and hopefully we'll be in a position to bring those to fruition,"" Barr said.

[ Also read: William Barr responds to critics of his reputation: 'Everyone dies']

In regards to the DOJ inspector general investigation, Barr said he would not describe Horowitz’s role as small, but rather as very specific. “He’s looking at a discrete area that is, you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page,"" Barr said. Page was a former Trump campaign adviser who was surveilled by the DOJ and the FBI for months beginning in October 2016.

More than a year ago, in March 2018, Horowitz announced the start of the FISA abuse investigation, saying he was doing so following requests from Sessions and Republican members of Congress. GOP lawmakers alleged the DOJ and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign and Trump's administration.

At the time, the inspector general's office said it would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” That “certain U.S. person” is Page.

The DOJ inspector general also said it would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” The “source” is Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose unverified dossier was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants against Page.

Steele has communicated in recent days that he’d be willing to cooperate with Horowitz but not with Durham.

Barr, who has said that Horowitz’s probe should be ending in May or June, called him a “superb government official” in this latest interview, but pointed out that Horowitz “has limited powers.”

“He doesn't have the power to compel testimony, he doesn't have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice,” Barr said. “His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”

That’s why Barr said he selected Durham, a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to head up DOJ’s newest inquiry. Barr was recently given broad declassification authority by Trump, and Durham will have greater investigative powers than Horowitz has at his disposal. Barr praised Durham, saying, “He has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorneys general to investigate these kinds of activities. And he's always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there's no doubt in my mind that he's going he's going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this.”

Barr defended his scrutiny of the actions of the DOJ and FBI in his CBS interview, saying, “I think it's important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country.”

“And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process? Who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done? And was everyone operating in their proper lane?” Barr asked."

One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
Senators urge USDA to stop foreign-owned companies from getting farm bailout money,https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/1354690-Senators-urge-USDA-to-stop-foreign-owned-companies-from-getting-farm-bailout-money,"WASHINGTON - A group of U.S. senators is urging Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ensure that a bailout program intended to help American farmers weather President Donald Trump's trade war does not benefit foreign-owned companies.

The program, which buys surplus commodities from farmers and ranchers, was pitched as a way to protect farmers during the U.S.-China trade war. But the USDA hasn't turned away foreign-owned corporations that want in. Earlier this year, taxpayer money was used to buy $5 million in pork products from a Brazilian-owned meatpacking firm. A Chinese-owned pork producer was slated to tap the program until the contract provoked intense criticism and was eventually canceled.

""It is unacceptable that American taxpayers have been subsidizing our competitors through trade assistance,"" according to a letter addressed to Perdue and signed by Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and eight other Democratic lawmakers. ""We ask that you ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer's bottom line - not the business interests of foreign corporations.""

Under a $12 billion bailout program announced last year, the Trump administration set aside $1.2 billion to buy surplus products from farmers, including more than $500 million from pork producers. Last week, the White House announced a separate $16 billion bailout that included $1.4 billion in commodity purchase relief for farmers.

The letter's other signatories are Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

listen live watch live

The senators pointed to what they called ""lucrative"" contracts that benefit foreign-owned entities and direct taxpayer money abroad. Those contracts include $62.5 million in pork products from JBS USA, which is owned by Brazil-based JBS SA. The food purchase program also was slated to buy $240,000 in pork products from Smithfield Foods, which is a subsidiary of Chinese-owned WH Group. Smithfield later asked that the contract be canceled after a political backlash. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a farmer and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was among those who expressed alarm that a foreign-owned company could benefit from the bailout. (The USDA said it has not tallied how much money has gone to foreign-owned companies, but the contracts themselves are public.)

""Whether it's the WH Group, which is closely tied to the Chinese government, or JBS SA, which is benefiting from the U.S's loss of market share in certain countries, it is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this Administration's trade policy,"" the senators wrote.

Perdue contends the program already buys only American-made products.

""JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers,"" Perdue said in a statement. ""What we do through these companies - it's not to help the companies - they offer a bid to us based on buying us farmers production. This helps U.S. farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.""

Dustin Baker, director of economics for the National Pork Producers Council, cautioned against limiting which pork producers could take advantage of the food purchasing program. Baker said that reducing the number of producers trying to get relief would only drive up the delivery costs of getting the products to food banks and needy families.

Plus, Baker said, just because some producers are foreign-owned doesn't mean they can't be ""the lifeblood of the economies in which they're located."" Many of these companies provide thousands of jobs in rural areas and, like their American-owned competitors, they must also comply with USDA guidelines, he said.

""The real purpose [of the program] is to take product off the domestic market that otherwise would have been exported,"" Baker said. ""By preventing companies from joining, all you're doing is increasing the cost of delivering that product to those who need it the most.""

In January, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said she would introduce the Buy American Agriculture Act, which would require the Agricultural Marketing Service to only buy food products from American companies. The legislation would also push for added transparency by requiring the agency to disclose why companies were awarded contracts.

""We were led to believe this program would assist producers impacted by low crop prices, not line the pockets of foreign companies who already report millions of dollars in annual profits,"" DeLauro in a statement at the time. ""The Buy American Agriculture Act would close that loophole and ensure that money spent by USDA on food purchases rightly prioritizes America's farmers and American businesses.""

Leave de Blasio alone,https://www.cityandstateny.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/commentary/leave-new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-alone.html,"Maybe it’s because I’ve been in the middle school girl trenches, and I understand the mechanics of middle school girl bullying, that I feel moved to defend New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio from the weaponized snickering that aims to erode his self-confidence and crush his presidential ambitions.

I get that he’s an adult politician with a powerful job aiming for an even more powerful job, but it sort of feels like the New York political media clique won’t let up until they make the poor guy cry. Of course, I’m not referring to legitimate investigations into potential conflicts of interest or abuses of power. The more actual journalism the merrier!

I’m talking about dozens of media outlets finding deep national significance in the actions of a couple of trolls at the mayor’s gym posting a warning that “by entering these premises you agree not to run for President of the United States.” Oh man, what a burn!

The political press, trembling with excitement, tore into the fresh opportunity to remind people that the mayor travels all the way to Park Slope from the Upper East Side – in a car! – to work out at his old neighborhood YMCA. Not that they typically need any real reason to do so. In an article about new environmental regulations that would literally change the face of New York by forcing the city’s glut of energy-inefficient glass skyscrapers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Crain’s New York Business partially headlined the piece: “De Blasio defends 11-mile drive to gym while promoting environmental plan.”

Why has the driving to the gym issue become such an emblem of de Blasio's supposed aristocratic detachment? Yes, the optics would be better if he took the subway. But the previous mayor knocked off work early every Friday to visit his friends at Greg’s Steakhouse in Bermuda via private jet. I challenge any of de Blasio’s critics to compare the carbon footprints of those two commutes.

To get some sort of perspective on why the political press seems fixated on inventing faux scandals at the expense of actual substantive reporting, I turned to the Columbia Journalism Review. Unfortunately, CJR’s analysis had all the nuance and insight of a burn book – offering a compilation of the greatest empty hit pieces on de Blasio. After citing several zingers from reporters mocking de Blasio for accidentally dropping a groundhog on Groundhog Day in 2014, CJR’s Alexandria Neason intones solemnly: “If he can’t recognize the look of skepticism among the city’s press, maybe he should listen.”

It’s that sort of tsk-tsking and eye-rolling that makes me – someone who has never donated to, volunteered for or worked for de Blasio – want to urge him to run for president, just to show the cool kids they haven’t gotten under his skin.

Their latest angle – that he can’t handle the responsibilities of being mayor and run for president at the same time – doesn’t seem to apply to any of the other people who have jumped into the race. Perhaps no one thinks that being a senator is a demanding job and that only people out of work with little responsibility should run for president. (If you want a full-time candidate, I’ve got a moody, road-tripping Gen Xer for you.)

So what is the real problem political reporters have with de Blasio? Since they were much more deferential to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg, my theory is that the problem with de Blasio is that he’s not a multibillionaire with a net worth larger than many foreign countries. Perhaps, after covering a guy who could afford to launch million-dollar ad campaigns in nonelection years and hire political talent just to prevent his opponents from hiring them, New York reporters started to believe that insulation from political wear-and-tear was normal.

Bloomberg was someone who could simply buy off dissent by spreading private donations to vulnerable neighborhood groups around the city (many of whom had lost public funding as a result of the mayor’s budget cuts). In 2008, he made it clear that he expected those who had benefited from his private philanthropy to show up at public hearings in support of easing term limits that would allow him to stay on for a third term.

“The traditional politicians are bought by special interest groups, but Bloomberg buys special interest groups,” Cooper Union history professor Fred Siegel told The New York Times at the time, adding that Bloomberg had “reversed the flow of money” in politics to build the illusion of widespread support.

Bloomberg’s allies now seem to be in the business of building the illusion of widespread revulsion toward de Blasio by writing stuff in the Observer like, “The man who has been routinely panned as the worst big city mayor in America has his eyes on a new gig: President of the United States.” If you follow the link to “worst big city mayor in America” to find out who has routinely panned de Blasio, you’ll discover it’s the writer himself – Bloomberg’s former political and communications adviser Arick Wierson – doing the original panning in a separate article. Usually, when people call elite political punditry an echo chamber, they don’t mean it quite this literally.

All of this isn’t to say that there aren’t legitimate criticisms of the mayor on homelessness and affordable housing, on the state of the subways and buses. And, really, what’s up with his attacks on e-bike delivery workers?

But when I survey progressives about their fundamental problem with de Blasio, I don’t get a lot back. They know they’re not supposed to like him, that he’s vaguely embarrassing, but can’t tell me why exactly. He dropped a groundhog once?

If my theory is correct, and de Blasio’s real problem is being a nonbillionaire trying to divert resources back to the working class using the tools and levers of plain old regular democracy – as opposed to making problems go away with a private stash of money – then I’m moved to stand up for our progressive mayor and his presidential ambitions.

Let’s slow down the de Blasio hate train and hear him out."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

"Justice Department opinions take on the force of law — but are not, in fact, the law",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution', 'May At Am']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-opinions-take-on-the-force-of-law--but-are-not-in-fact-the-law/2019/05/30/f4efe222-8280-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html,"The Justice Department issues opinions through its Office of Legal Counsel that have been called “the law that presidents make.” (Amr Alfiky/Reuters)

When former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declared that indicting a sitting president was “unconstitutional,” some legal experts were taken aback. The question has never been litigated and so never decided by the Supreme Court.

The reality, as Mueller said in the same breath — making his first public comments Wednesday on his Russia investigation — is that the prohibition on charging presidents with federal crimes is “long-standing department policy.” It was formulated in two opinions during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

The opinions of this elite corps of lawyers are binding on the federal government — but are not the equivalent of Supreme Court rulings.

[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinion]

For these lawyers are not “umpires,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. once described the role of Supreme Court justices. They are the president’s lawyers, whose stated responsibilities include “facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law.”

The body of opinions they produce have been called “the law that presidents make.”

And it is no surprise that such law holds that presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Friday in a blog post that as president, she would seek a reversal of that Justice Department policy. “When I’m elected, I will exercise my constitutional authority to appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one — not even a President — is above the law,” she said.

While the OLC is proud of its “independent and principled” judgment, a recent Cornell Law Review study of its work, as well as a review of its publicly available decisions, suggests that it has a hard time saying “no” to its chief client.

The yeses accumulate. And because the Supreme Court tends to stay away from separation-of-powers issues, an OLC opinion becomes precedent for the next OLC opinion on the same subject, and the next one and the one after that.

Before long, it’s all settled as far as the Justice Department is concerned.

That’s how White House claims of “executive privilege” have evolved. What began as a few historical examples of withheld information by a handful of presidents and a passing acknowledgment in the Supreme Court’s 1974 Watergate tapes case, U.S. v. Nixon, is now routinely invoked by presidents as fundamental law.

The OLC’s recent opinion supporting President Trump’s barring of House Judiciary Committee testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn is illustrative, citing “nearly five decades” of OLC precedent in support of Trump’s claim.

Similarly, the OLC cited prior opinions and “centuries of historical practice and precedents” in addition to its interpretation of the law, when it determined that Trump could name Matthew G. Whitaker acting attorney general, temporarily replacing Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that Whitaker had held no position confirmed by the Senate.

“Some people have described it as a one-way ratchet,” said Jonathan Shaub, who served in the OLC from 2014 through the summer of 2017. “A president does something. The next president comes along and says, ‘I can do this other thing that’s just a step further.’ ”

The OLC’s precedent, Shaub said, “sets the stage for future presidents, and most favor executive branch authority.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.

Unlike a court, the OLC’s opinion-making process is neither neutral, adversarial nor transparent. Much of its work is kept secret. Some is informal, according to lawyers who have worked there, consisting of emails and purely oral communications.

All this is among the reasons executive branch power keeps expanding, often at the expense of Congress, particularly in areas involving war powers and national security.

On occasion, precedent doesn’t matter so much. The most recent example of that came when the OLC said the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as adviser to the president, did not run afoul of federal nepotism laws.

The decision, dated on Trump’s Inauguration Day, ran contrary to at least four earlier OLC opinions on similar questions.

The office said it had “reexamined the legislative materials” on nepotism. (The federal anti-nepotism law was enacted after Bobby Kennedy served as attorney general to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and did not apply to Hillary Clinton, who served as health-care adviser to her husband, because a court ruled the first lady was a “de facto” White House official.)

The most famous reversal was the revocation by the OLC in 2004 of the “torture memos” authorized by the same office for the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

For a Cornell Law Review article, scholar Adoree Kim compared the OLC’s publicly released decisions advising executive branch agencies with those advising the White House and found a sharp divergence. While the office often felt free to say “no” to agency legal interpretations, it was far more obliging to the White House.

“The OLC is deeply deferential to the President and to presidential action,” she wrote, and “this deference is not unique to times of crisis. It is also not limited to the realm of foreign affairs, or to constitutional questions. Rather, the OLC demonstrates systematic partiality toward the President.” The office, she concluded, is indeed the “president’s law firm.”

But “as a practical matter,” said Walter Dellinger, who ran the office for three years under President Bill Clinton, “it is difficult to cut back on opinions expanding executive power,” though it can and has been done.

Deference to the president “is baked into OLC’s culture,” former OLC lawyer Erica Newland wrote recently in The Washington Post. It “proceeds from the assumption that the president is acting consistent with Article II of the Constitution and with his oath of office, both of which require that he ‘faithfully’ execute the laws.”

“But when I was at OLC, I saw again and again how the decision to trust the president failed the office’s attorneys, the Justice Department and the American people. The failure took different forms,” she wrote. “Sometimes, we just wouldn’t look that closely at the claims the president was making about the state of the world. When we did look closely, we could give only nudges.”

Newland left the office in November. “I decided that the responsibilities entailed in my oath were incompatible with the expectations of my job,” she wrote."
Trump's ethanol plan goes into effect,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trumps-ethanol-plan-goes-into-effect,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday officially opened up year-round sales of higher ethanol fuel blends, called E15, fulfilling a promise President Trump made to Iowa corn farmers.

Trump has firmly backed the year-round sale of 15% ethanol fuel, despite opposition by the oil industry and refiners who argue the fuel would harm vehicle engines.

The E15 rule, a boon to corn farmers, follows billions of dollars the administration has doled out to farmers as compensation for the losses they've suffered from tariffs imposed in the trade war with China.

Farmers and the ethanol industry have been calling for the reversal of EPA's Reid vapor restrictions on the fuel for years to allow E15 to be sold year-round, instead of just in the winter, spring and fall months.

Allowing E15 to be sold in the summer opens the ethanol market up to the largest driving season of the year, with farmers expecting to see demand rise for the corn-based fuel.

Most of the U.S. gasoline supply already contains 10% ethanol. The 15% blend is being sold by such large gasoline chain stores as Sheetz and KwikStop in anticipation of the rule's rollout.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley recently told the Washington Examiner that the ethanol rule would give Trump an edge over his Democratic rivals in the 2020 presidential election. He explained that it would be hard for his rivals to demonstrate the same commitment to farmers as Trump has in passing this new rule.

Nevertheless, Grassley and fellow Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said that Trump's trade wars could cancel any of the gains the ethanol rule would provide for farmers.

EPA is also granting waivers to oil companies allowing them to forgo blending ethanol under the Renewable Fuel Standard program. The RFS requires refiners to blend renewable fuels in the nation's gasoline and diesel supplies. The ethanol industry argues that the refinery waivers are destroying demand for their product.

Industry lobbyists say allowing the sale of E15 year-round cannot make up for the effect of the waivers, which effectively reduce the amount of ethanol by over a billion gallons annually. Oil refiners say the ethanol industry's claims are exaggerated."
Spray cheese would count as food stamp staple under Trump administration proposal,https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposal-would-count-spray-cheese-beef-jerky-staple-foods/,"A new policy proposed by the Trump administration would allow foods like spray cheese to be considered ""staples"" for federal food stamps. Staple foods are important to the food stamps program, officially known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), as regulations require SNAP retailers to stock a certain number of these food staples.

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."
Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official

[Related: DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media]

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

[Also read: DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says]

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"
Justice Department asks Supreme Court to move quickly on DACA,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/daca-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A frustrated Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.

As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and the Supreme Court has not acted upon a longstanding request from the Justice Department to take up the issue.

The justices' inaction suggests that some of them believe the issue should percolate in the lower courts before Supreme Court review."
Acting DHS secretary McAleenan says he has no problem standing up to Trump,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-problem-standing-trump/story?id=63383183,"Acting Homeland Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he has no problem standing up to President Donald Trump when it comes to making recommendations on the border crisis, insisting in an interview this week with ABC News that ""if you make a good case and get your facts in order, he'll listen.""

McAleenan took charge of the Homeland Security Department after Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign last month and Trump promised supporters he'd take a tougher approach on stopping illegal immigration. While only in the role on a temporary basis, McAleenan was mostly a popular choice, even among some Democrats, because of his reputation as more of a pragmatic law enforcement official than an anti-immigration hardliner.

McAleenan has since drawn on this public persona to make his case to Congress to help address the border crisis through legislation, even when appearing inherently at odds with the president on such matters as supporting foreign aid and family separations. McAleenan has said that the 2018 policy that led to thousands of family separations at the border wasn't successful because it eroded public trust; Trump has said ending routine family separations has been a ""disaster"" that's led to more border crossings.

When asked by ABC News' Matt Gutman whether he's ever stood up to the president, McAleenan said ""of course,"" adding that Trump expects his cabinet to provide honest assessments.

""I'm a person of integrity,"" McAleenan said in an interview from Guatemala on Wednesday. ""I've been a career law enforcement officer. I think [Trump] expects no less than the best facts and the best recommendations I can make to him, and I'll continue to do that.”

But while McAleenan was in Guatemala, his mission there seemed to run counter to Trump's ""America First"" approach. Whereas McAleenan was working with the government in Guatemala to try to crack down on smuggling networks and hearing from non-governmental organizations on the importance of foreign aid, Trump has largely panned diplomatic outreach and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers at the U.S. border. Officials have since said future funds are frozen, but existing contracts are still being paid.

Trump announced late Thursday, with McAleenan's support, that he was planning to levy tariffs against Mexico unless it stopped Central Americans traveling through its borders. McAleenan led a phone call with a reporters announcing the plan.

Trump has taken other major steps to try to curb illegal immigration only to be swiftly blocked by the courts. The Justice Department announced this week it would appeal a federal judge's ruling that blocked Trump from bypassing Congress to pay for border wall construction by pulling $1 billion from military accounts, including pay and pension funds.

Migrant families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year – double the number from last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with them because of the promise of a quick release, allowing them to live and work while waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics have countered that the president has done too little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and that his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Opinion | Can a Sitting President Be Charged With a Crime?,https://www.nytimes.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/opinion/letters/trump-president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Robert Mueller’s public statement left most with the impression that the president would have been indicted but for the legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. This is enshrined in a Justice Department policy that Mr. Mueller had to follow. But this policy is not based on any provision of the Constitution, any law passed by Congress or any court decision.

The policy flies in the face of the principle that no man is above the law in this country, including the president. That is not just a concept. It is the basis of numerous court decisions such as United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones. No case has decided otherwise.

It is time that the policy that handcuffed Mr. Mueller be revisited and abandoned, or tested in court. Otherwise the only consequence for a criminal president is the impeachment process, which is unlikely today with a Senate controlled by the president’s own party.

Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."

Lightbridge Fuel uses a helically-twisted shape and unique metallic composition which the company says can significantly reduce fuel operating temperatures, improve the fuel's structural integrity and enhance its response to abnormal events. Enfission - a joint venture of Lightbridge Corporation and Framatome - was set up in January 2018 to commercialise nuclear fuel assemblies based on this technology.

The GAIN initiative was launched in November 2015 to provide a way to fast-track nuclear innovation, providing stakeholders with a means of accessing DOE research and development infrastructure to help them meet the challenges of bringing new technologies towards engineering-scale demonstration.

This is Framatome's third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design.

Framatome said its collaboration with INL under this GAIN voucher will ""leverage the laboratory's experience in fuel and material development, as well as its performance knowledge, to facilitate Framatome's understanding of phenomena unique to uranium-zirconium metallic fuel"".

Over a one-year period, Framatome and INL will work under the voucher to generate failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and a phenomena identification ranking table (PIRT) based on the Lightbridge Fuel concept. Both the FMEA and PIRT are important steps in licensing an advanced fuel product in the USA and will be required inputs to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

For this work DOE will fund INL at a value of USD477,000.

""This voucher enables Framatome to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel,"" said Robert Freeman, vice president of contracts and services, fuel commercial and customer centre at Framatome. ""We are enthusiastic about the transformative science and technology benefits of this metallic fuel's unique composition and geometry for the nuclear energy industry.""

Enfission CEO Seth Grae said: ""We appreciate this support from DOE for Lightbridge Fuel, which is designed to increase power output, enhance economics and provide additional safety benefits for existing and future reactors worldwide. We look forward to working closely with Framatome, INL and DOE to further advance Lightbridge Fuel toward commercialisation.""

DOJ watchdog says assistant US attorney admitted to eating marijuana edibles,https://thehill.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/446196-doj-watchdog-says-assistant-us-attorney-admitted-to-eating-marijuana,"A Department of Justice watchdog has alleged that an assistant U.S. attorney ate marijuana edibles and did not properly disclose the use of a controlled substance on a security form, according to a new report.

The report, released Thursday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), said the unnamed assistant U.S. attorney self-reported to the OIG that they possessed, transported and consumed the edibles in August or September 2016 for back pain.

The attorney's spouse allegedly threatened to report the use to the Justice Department during a marital dispute because they assumed the attorney had not disclosed it on their Questionnaire for National Security Positions form, according to the OIG report.

The report stated that the attorney noted that when they submitted this form in February 2017, it erroneously said they had not used a controlled substance in the past seven years.

The Justice Department watchdog concluded the attorney violated federal and state criminal law and “lacked candor” in an interview with the OIG, during which they said their incorrect responses on the form were inadvertent. Federal and state authorities opted against any criminal prosecution.

The OIG noted that it has provided its report to the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility and to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys “for action they deem appropriate.”

“As Director I take any allegation of AUSA misconduct very seriously,"" James A. Crowell IV, director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, said in a statement to The Hill. ""Due to the Privacy Act I cannot comment further on personnel matters.”

"After the News That Leaked From the Justice Department at 8:34 p.m. on Friday, Life at Google Might Never Be the Same",https://www.inc.com,"['Like This Column', 'Sign Up To', 'The Opinions Expressed Here Inc.Com Columnists Are Their Own', 'Not Those Of Inc.Com.']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/after-news-that-leaked-from-justice-department-at-834-pm-on-friday-life-at-google-might-never-be-same.html,"Friday evening, the weather in Washington was incredible: the kind of pleasant, late spring or early summer night when the temperature is so comfortable that you almost forget there actually is a temperature.

I imagine the whole city kicking back, taking a brief respite from the partisan warfare and bureaucratic lobbying that govern much of life.

All of which makes the news that leaked in the middle of it even more remarkable.

Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Brent Kendall and John D. McKinnon first reported at 8:34 p.m. that ""[t]he Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, a move that could present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant.""

The reporting was sourced only to ""people familiar with the matter,"" which is the classic language for a Washington leak -- and timed for a late spring Friday evening when almost everyone else had knocked off for the weekend.

Interestingly, the Journal report says that the government has been planning the move ""in recent weeks,"" which could coincide with when Google unveiled a series of privacy controls that many critics say are window dressing, designed more to protect Google's digital advertising business (which did $30.7 billion in the first quarter of this year).

Regardless, this won't be the first time that Google has faced off against U.S. government regulators.

The last time around, in 2013, the Federal Trade Commission ""conducted a broad antitrust investigation,"" as the Journal put it, but closed without taking any action -- ""though Google made some voluntary changes to certain business practices.""

This time, however, there are at least five giant differences:

The first is that the entire cultural perception of tech and big tech giants has changed. As recently as 2017, Google ranked 7th on the Harris Poll annual list of the most visible companies in America, ranked by public perception. By 2018 it was number 28; this year it's currently 41st. The second is that this is the Justice Department, not the FTC. As the FTC explains on its website, the two agencies share jurisdiction but -- and I don't know yet if this is relevant, but it would worry me -- only the DOJ can ""obtain criminal sanctions"" in antitrust cases. The third is that in the meantime, Google has been walloped by antitrust regulators in Europe, including multi-billion dollar fines Fourth, 2013 was the Obama era. We're in the President Trump era now. During his nomination hearings in January, Attorney General William Barr specifically talked about antitrust enforcement against the big tech giants. (""I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers."") Finally, while Republicans control the executive branch, it's not as if Google can count on knee-jerk defense from Democrats in the current era. In fact, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is currently running for president, has been calling for the breakup of big tech companies under antitrust grounds for months.

So, where does this leave Google? In uncharted waters within the United States, at least. As Tony Romm of The Washington Post, who confirmed the Journal report, put it:"

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
"Nunes: FBI, DOJ Know ""Their Gig Is Up""; American People Know Something Doesn't Add Up",https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/01/nunes_fbi_doj_know_theyre_gig_is_up_american_people_know_something_doesnt_add_up.html,"Rep. Devin Nunes (D-CA) said Democrats are digging themselves in a deeper hole over the Mueller Russia probe. Nunes said the American people know that something ""really stinks"" and if the media would ""tell the truth"" that 75% of Americans would believe using counterintelligence capabilities to surveil a candidate for political office is wrong.



""This is the most powerful law enforcement agency on earth,"" Nunes said of the FBI. ""How is it that they couldn't figure out whether or not Michael Cohen was in Prague? Carter Page, he had been willing to talk to the FBI. In fact, he sent James Comey a letter back in October of 2016. So, month after month after month goes by. The most powerful large enforcement agency on earth, something doesn't add up here. It just stinks. It really stinks and I think the American people know it and I think their gig's up.""



""The whole thing is assinine from the start and what they keep doing is digging,"" Nunes told FNC's Bill Hemmer. ""That's what the Democrats in Congress keep doing. They keep digging. And if the press were to actually tell the truth in this country I think this would be overwhelming that what Barr is doing to rein this in and actually go after and investigate the investigators, I think you would see 75% of American say, yeah, what happened here was wrong. We shouldn't use the counterintelligence capabilities in this country to target a political candidate.""







REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Department of Justice is not supposed to be telegraphing whether or not somebody is possibly guilty or not. Either you are or aren't. Either they're going to prosecute you or they're not. And I think saying that the DOJ doesn't operate as some adjunct piece of governing body of the Congress is exactly right...



There are multiple ways that the FBI in short order -- this is the most powerful law enforcement agency on earth. How is it that they couldn't figure out whether or not Michael Cohen was in Prague? Carter Page, he had been willing to talk to the FBI. In fact, he sent James Comey a letter back in October of 2016. So, month after month after month goes by. The most powerful large enforcement agency on earth, something doesn't add up here. It just stinks. It really stinks and I think the American people know it and I think their gig's up.



I think the Democrats are in trouble because they perpetuated this hoax on the American people, the Clinton folks and then the Democrats in Congress don't forget... the Democrats opposed us every single time we had... to figure out whether it was Fusion GPS that wrote the Steele Dossier and they were being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democrats themselves. They oppose that. Do you remember when we put out a memo that said there was FISA abuse that occurred? They opposed that. These are the same characters who are, quite frankly, not being held accountable by the press. The press has really let us down here in this country...



This is like when whoever they've been investigating, they destroyed a murder weapon, or they destroyed tapes, or they did something... the prosecution believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there really was a crime and they did something to cover that crime up.



Comey's memos are really defensive exhibit A against and obstruction of justice charge because you have the president of the United States saying, 'Look, Comey, investigate this. Cohen wasn't in Prague. There's no pee tape. I didn't have any girlfriends in Russia. I didn't talk to anybody in Russia.' That's the president saying this. So, how are they really going to get an obstruction of justice charge? The whole thing is assinine from the start and what they keep doing is digging. That's what the Democrats in Congress keep doing. They keep digging. And if the press were to actually tell the truth in this country I think this would be overwhelming that what Barr is doing to rein this in and actually go after and investigate the investigators, I think you would see 75% of American say, yeah, what happened here was wrong. We shouldn't use the counterintelligence capabilities in this country to target a political candidate."
SA chosen as site of 2020 DOD Warrior Games,https://www.ksat.com,"['Https', 'Www.Ksat.Com Author Garrett.Brnger', 'Garrett Brnger', 'Www.Ksat.Com Author Lcienfuegos', 'Luis Cienfuegos']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.ksat.com/news/sa-chosen-as-site-of-2020-dod-warrior-games,"SAN ANTONIO - Already known as ""Military City, USA,"" San Antonio will be the host city for the 2020 Department of Defense Warrior Games, city officials announced Thursday.

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.
