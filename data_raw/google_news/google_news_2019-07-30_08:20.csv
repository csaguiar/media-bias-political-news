"Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers Pull Race Card On Trump",https://deadline.com,['Anita Bennett'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://deadline.com/2019/07/stephen-colbert-trevor-noah-seth-meyers-pull-race-card-on-trump-1202656806/,"President Donald Trump’s seemingly endless attacks on Rep. Elijah Cummings made their way onto the late night shows.

During Monday night’s monologue, Late Show host Stephen Colbert presented “episode three — million” of his segment “Is Donald Trump a Racist?”

“Previously on, ‘Is Donald Trump racist?’ Yes!” Colbert said to laughter. “But some people still aren’t convinced. Not even after his Twitter attack on chairman of the House Oversight Committee and the man watching his white co-workers explain Get Out to him, Elijah Cummings.”

For those not keeping score, Trump bashed the Maryland Congressman and described the city of Baltimore — which Cummings represents — as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,” Saturday on Twitter.

Since then, the president has faced a barrage of criticism and been branded a “racist” by many Democrats, social media users, and earlier today the Rev. Al Sharpton, who called Trump a “bigot” at a news conference in Baltimore.

As for Trump, he insists he’s not racist and Sunday on Twitter, turned the tables by saying Democrats “always play the race card.”

But Colbert wasn’t buying Trump’s defense and dealt the race card back to the president.

“I’m not the racist, he’s the racist!” Colbert said in his best Trump voice. “After all, I wouldn’t have said anything racist at all if he [Cummings] was white.”

Seth Meyers was even more blunt.

“Another weekend, another racist outburst from our racist president,” he said Monday on Late Night, before tossing to his “Closer Look” segment.

“So once again, he attacked a Congressman of color by using the word ‘infested,’ just as he did two weeks ago when he told four Democratic Congresswomen of color… to go back to the ‘crime infested places from which they came.'”

“Hey man, the only thing that’s infested here is your brain,” Meyers quipped.

Over on the Daily Show, host Trevor Noah appeared confounded by Trump’s description of Baltimore as a “rodent infested mess.”

It’s “not exactly how you would expect an American president to talk about an American city,” Noah said, before essentially branding Trump a racist.

“As multiple people have pointed out, this language is part of a pattern. President Trump always uses the word ‘infestation’ when talking about people of color,” Noah said. “You don’t need to be a genius to understand what Trump is implying.”"

Opinion | An Impeachment Inquiry Is Coming. It Might Have Already Begun.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/opinion/trump-impeachment.html,"Mueller’s presentation may have been underwhelming, but he allowed Democrats to put a bow around his findings, clearing away some of the deliberate confusion created by Attorney General William Barr’s misleading summary. “The press focused on the performance and the optics instead of on the substance,” said Jerry Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. “Mueller said we were attacked by the Russians, the Trump campaign cooperated in many ways with that attack, they welcomed it, in many ways they worked with it.”

Democrats already knew all this, of course. But just as Trump’s recent racist outbursts forced renewed attention to his bigotry, Mueller made Congress squarely confront the president’s lawlessness and disloyalty to the country he purports to lead. Once he testified, congressional Democrats could no longer punt on the impeachment question by saying that they were waiting to hear from him.

And even if Mueller’s appearance didn’t change many minds, it galvanized some voters. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat, told me that in recent days, “The constituent calls that I have been getting have just increased, both in number and intensity, saying: ‘Enough is enough. It’s time for him to go.’” On Monday, she came out for beginning an impeachment inquiry.

Perhaps even more significant than the growing number of calls for impeachment is a lawsuit filed by the Judiciary Committee on Friday. The filing, demanding access to grand jury material from the Mueller investigation, says that the committee “is conducting an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” In other words, the Judiciary Committee, which would oversee any potential impeachment, announced, with surprisingly little fanfare, that an impeachment inquiry is already underway.

For months now, there’s been an acrimonious intra-Democratic debate about whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should call a vote to begin such an inquiry. Now, however, the Judiciary Committee is asserting that such a vote isn’t required, and as Nadler points out, Pelosi has signed off on the strategy. The House would have to vote on impeachment itself, but that would come only after the Judiciary Committee has done much of its work."

US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/29/doj-asylum-claims-family-relations-1624028,"Attorney General William Barr said that being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images immigration DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

State spent $234K on Trump trip to Turnberry,https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/455222-state-spent-234k-on-trump-trip-to-turnberry,"The State Department spent nearly $234,000 on President Trump Donald John TrumpSharpton: Trump has 'particular venom' for blacks, people of color Trump signs 9/11 compensation fund bill alongside first responders Trump continues assault on Fed: It 'has made all of the wrong moves' MORE’s trip last July to his property in Scotland, according to a new report from the department’s inspector general.

Inspector General Steve Linick wrote in a July 22 letter to three Democratic lawmakers that the State Department spent $233,732.86 on overtime, hotels, rental cars and temporary duty costs for a trip to Trump Turnberry from July 14 to July 15, 2018, according to documents obtained by The Hill.

That total does not include costs for which State was reimbursed by the Department of Homeland Security, the letter noted, and therefore reflects only a portion of the overall expense of the trip.

“American taxpayers shouldn’t have to foot the bill for the President’s excessive and lavish golfing jaunts abroad,” an aide speaking on behalf of the three lawmakers said in a statement.

“The nearly $234,000 identified by the State Department Inspector General represents only a fraction of the total spending for just one weekend at the President’s Scottish golf course last year,” the aide added.

The lawmakers are still awaiting a similar accounting from the Department of Homeland Security detailing its own costs associated with the Turnberry trip. It's unclear when the report might be issued.

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General did not respond to a request for comment.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

The bulk of the State Department’s expenses for the Scotland trip came from $111,261.44 spent on hotels, according to the letter from Linick.

But just a small portion of that amount was spent on lodging for State Department employees at Trump Turnberry.

Linick wrote that the department spent $728 for three rooms for two nights to accommodate the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom and his wife and the ambassador’s chief of protocol.

In response to a question from lawmakers about comparing the rate at Trump Turnberry to rates at other area hotels, the State Department found that the president's property was cheaper than other lodging options considered in Glasgow.

“The Trump Turnberry is situated outside Glasgow, and the rates offered here are very favourable to the Government,” the State Department said in reviewing the options. “The Trump Turnberry is therefore determined to offer a fair and reasonable rate to the Government.”

Beyond lodging, the State Department spent $42,406.54 on overtime costs, $28,625.27 on rental cars and $51,439.61 on temporary duty costs, according to the documents.

It’s not clear whether such costs are out of the ordinary for presidential travel.

The State Department's Office of Inspector General declined to comment beyond the report and therefore did not respond to questions about how the Trump Turnberry trip compared to other presidential travel or what the roughly $110,000 in additional hotel costs covered.

The State Department did not answer in its report lawmakers' questions about how much the Turnberry property profited from the stay, but the trip falls into a broader area of concern from Democrats who have accused the president of using his office to boost his brand.

Critics of the president have consistently raised ethics concerns with his tendency to periodically spend weekends away from the White House at his own properties, arguing it depletes resources and boosts the Trump brand.

The president last month stayed at Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Doonbeg in Ireland while abroad on a trip to the United Kingdom and France. The property tweeted — and then later deleted — two videos directly referencing the president’s stay, prompting criticism from ethics watchdogs over the blurred line between business and government interests.

A federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit earlier this month filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments without Congress’s approval.

A separate emoluments lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers is still proceeding through the court system.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

Last week, a federal judge in California late blocked the Trump administration's new asylum rule dramatically limiting the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico.

The administration also filed an emergency motion in the Northern District Court of California to allow the asylum restrictions to go into effect while the appeal to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals plays out. The Justice Department asked Judge Jon Tigar to decide whether he would stay his order blocking the rule by Friday.

The move puts yet another of President Donald Trump's immigration policies before the 9th Circuit, which has ruled against some of the President's policies.

The ruling from Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, came the same day that a federal judge in Washington, DC, an appointee of President Donald Trump, had declined to block the rule. Tigar's decision, which affects the entire country, took precedence.

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day later. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

Maheda did not respond to requests for comment."

Bobby Scott says",https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Lauren Fox']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/students-free-meals-usda-food-stamps-bobby-scott/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Why the Justice Department's Plan to Use a Single Drug for Lethal Injections Is Controversial,https://time.com,['Josiah Bates'],,,,https://time.com/5636513/pentobarbital-executions-justice-department/,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s surprise announcement that the federal government would resume executions after more than 15 years included one detail in particular that is troubling many anti-death penalty advocates.

Barr announced last Thursday that the Justice Department will start executing federal death-row inmates for the first time since 2003, bringing back the practice that has been highly criticized and removed from certain states. Seven states have abandoned the death penalty since 2003.

“Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people’s representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,” Attorney General Barr said in a statement. “The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

As opposed to prior executions, which used multiple drugs for lethal injection, federal executions will only use one drug: pentobarbital. Some states have already used the chemical for executions including Texas, Missouri and Georgia.

States started using it for executions in 2011, due to a shortage of sodium thiopental, which was previously used in executions––along with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.

Barr’s announcement comes five years after the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma. In 2014, Lockett was injected with a combination of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. It was an untested blend of chemicals. Appearing to be unconscious, Lockett woke up and thrashed around before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later. The case brought national attention to the drugs used in lethal injections.

Then-President Barack Obama responded to the public outrage on the incident by calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to review how the death penalty is applied.

Concerns over the effectiveness of multi-drug lethal injections also encouraged states to turn to pentobarbital, according to experts.

“Since 2010, 14 states have used pentobarbital in over 200 executions and federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld the use of pentobarbital in executions as consistent with the Eighth Amendment,” the Department of Justice said in a statement announcing the resumption of federal executions.

The first execution dates for the new procedure are set for December for five convicted murderers. There are currently 65 federal prisoners on death row.

Here’s what to know about pentobarbital and why it’s controversial.

What is pentobarbital?

Pentobarbital is a sedative that slows the activity of the brain and nervous system. The drug is commonly used to euthanize pets.

There have been 143 executions that were carried out only with pentobarbital, but it’s unclear where the federal government will get it from and how they will administer it.

“Nobody knows if the pentobarbital that the government has obtained will address the serious risks that individuals across the country are facing of being tortured to death through lethal injection,” Sam Spital, the Director of Litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund tells TIME.

Capital punishment opponents say this is problematic because a bad batch of the drug, or improper use could lead to botched executions that cause pain before death.

Ruth Friedman, the director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project, says the Justice Department was deliberate in not giving details on where they’re getting the drug from or how it will be administered.

“We have no idea if it’s imported, we have no idea if it’s compounded or manufactured. There’s no way to know,” Freidman tells TIME. “That was a calculated decision.”

Freidman believes it is meant to avoid getting pushback from anti-death penalty groups.

In 2014, Oklahoma used a combination of pentobarbital, potassium chloride and vecuronium bromide to execute convicted murderer Michael Lee Wilson. As the drugs were administered Wilson said, “I feel my whole body burning” before he died.

The new federal guidelines state that only pentobarbital will be used and, according to the DOJ statement, the Supreme Court has upheld the use of this drug in executions.

In April, the Texas Supreme Court allowed the state to protect the identity of their pentobarbital supplier. The Supreme Court in Missouri upheld the use of pentobarbital for death row inmate Russell Bucklew. He is scheduled to be executed on Oct. 1.

Many pharmaceutical companies have stopped supplying drugs to the government for executions, but death penalty opponents say there are ways for the government to find workarounds.

Compounding pharmacies, which are companies that produce mixtures of drugs, are not as heavily regulated as drug manufacturers, and anti-death penalty advocates say that state governments are already using them to get access to drugs for lethal injections.

The DOJ would not comment on where the pentobarbital it plans to use in executions will come from, or how it will be administered.

In Texas, the Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy made the state return pentobarbital that had been purchased for executions after the company’s identity was publicly leaked. Missouri also paid cash for pentobarbital from a compounding pharmacy so there would be no paper trail.

Did the Justice Department go through the correct legal process?

Death penalty opponents are also concerned that Barr’s decision to use pentobarbital in executions did not go through the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which governs the process of rule making for federal agencies.

“Congress and the public have a right to know what this is about,” Freidman says.

Megan McCracken, a lawyer at the University of California-Berkley School of Law’s Death Penalty Clinic, tells TIME that skipping the APA process makes this new death penalty procedure invalid and therefore open to legal challenges.

“That is an act that brings transparency and accountability to the rule making process for an agency and here they skipped that process all together,” McCracken says.

Normally, when a federal agency develops or makes changes to regulations, it must go through the APA which allows the public to comment on proposed changes before they are put into place.

There is also a lawsuit pending against the federal government on behalf of some death row inmates that argues the use of lethal injection exposes the inmates to a considerable risk of pain.

While the lawsuit is still under review in the federal D.C. District Court, the five men set to be executed in December were not a part of that lawsuit, so the Justice Department was able to avoid addressing the suit with its announcement.

How will this decision affect the state level?

Right now, there are 21 states that don’t have the death penalty and another four that have moratoriums on executions. Federal death row inmates make up a small proportion of the 2,673 inmates on death row in the states that don’t ban executions. According to experts, it’s unclear how the new federal decision will impact those states.

“I continue to believe that the country as a whole is moving away from the death penalty and I don’t believe this one decision will change that,” Spital says. “On the other hand, the federal government does lead by example and to have the federal government so sharply going this way is deeply troubling.”

Support for the death penalty was at a record low in 2016, but has increased slightly since then according to the Pew Research Center. A 2018 survey by Pew found that only 39% of Americans were against the death penalty while 54% were in support of it.

Nationwide, executions slowed down as states struggled to find the drugs for lethal injections. However, they have begun picking up again in some states. Texas has executed three people this year. Last year the state executed 13. Tennessee had three executions in 2018. Florida and Georgia both had two executions in 2018.

“There are many states that have been carrying out executions while the feds have been doing nothing so there’s no direct reason why this should affect any given state for any reason.” McCraken says.

However she also acknowledges that because it’s the federal government, that they could have an “atmospheric affect” on what the states decide to do.

“In so many states the death penalty is a broken system and it is just as broken in the federal government. So you have problems of race and innocence and the most vulnerable people ending up on death row,” McCraken says. “It shouldn’t be a situation where the feds are held up as leaders.”

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."
"For Two Weeks, Soybean Crop Shows No Progress, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/for-two-weeks-soybean-crop-shows-no-progress-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The U.S. corn and soybean crops conditions barely changed from a week ago, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday.

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."

Vinnik, who remains in custody in Greece as governments worldwide jockey to extradite him, stands accused of laundering billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen from other exchanges, most notably Mt. Gox.

Trump DOJ Sues BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik for $100 Million for Illicit Bitcoin Dealings

Alexander Vinnik bitcoin launderer BTC-e More

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."

"At Vermont VA hospital, swirling accusations of harassment, retaliation, negligence",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/07/28/hospital-swirling-accusations-harassment-retaliation-and-negligence/El7CDjsgvIW3BGZVKqSxdP/story.html,"But if that strong appraisal represented a pinnacle of Keller’s eight years at the VA, the last 13 months have represented a professional nadir, one involving a tangle of conflicting allegations of assault, medical negligence, and whistle-blower retaliation that has reverberated to the upper levels of the federal agency.

She received an overall rating of “outstanding,” earning highest marks for her clinical competence, supervisory ability, and personal qualities. The review was signed in November 2017 by Dr. Fima Lenkovsky, chief of the hospital’s anesthesiology department.

“This has shaken me to my soul,” said Keller, 51, a clinical assistant professor at Dartmouth College’s medical school who was fired from the VA hospital in October. “I am naive, and this has been an ugly process.”

Hospital officials said Keller, interviewed by the Globe at her lawyer’s office, was fired for endangering patient safety. But Keller and other female employees say her termination was reprisal for speaking out against Lenkovsky for allegedly bullying and harassing female employees, including a reported assault against a nurse during an operation in June 2018.

Keller’s dismissal outraged Dr. Stewart Levenson, a former VA official who served as medical services director for the New England system during 18 years at the agency.

“This is perhaps the most shocking case of misuse of the disciplinary process that I can recall from my VA experience, one that fails on any level to pass the ‘sniff’ test,” he wrote to VA attorneys. “The removal of Dr. Keller is not only extreme but unprecedented.”

Keller is one of four female employees at White River Junction who filed whistle-blower complaints against Lenkovsky with the VA’s Office of Special Counsel. The office has since referred the complaints to the VA medical inspector after determining they contained a “substantial likelihood of wrongdoing.”

In a whistle-blower complaint filed two days before her dismissal, Keller said that the hospital’s actions against her were punishment “for criticizing her supervisor, whose serious abuse and mismanagement was reported by no less than five different female employees of the VA.”

Two weeks after the alleged assault in the operating room, Keller and three nurses — including the nurse who brought the allegation — met with the hospital’s acting director, Dr. Brett Rusch. At that meeting, Keller told Rusch she did not believe Lenkovsky treated male doctors, nurses, and staff in the “abusive and hostile way he treated the female staff,” according to her whistle-blower complaint.

Later that month, Keller told VA police she was “not surprised” when she heard of the assault allegation, which she described in a witness statement as “consistent with Dr. Lenkovsky’s behavior in the past.”

Christine Murphy, the hospital’s chief nurse anesthetist and the person who leveled the allegation, told Rusch that Lenkovsky intentionally struck her arm during a difficult operation, a blow she said was hard enough to bruise her forearm.

“I had a bruise the size of a quarter on my right arm after the event, which my colleagues observed,” she wrote in a subsequent statement to VA police. At least eight witnesses were present, Murphy has said.

Following the meeting with Rusch, Lenkovsky was suspended pending a five-week internal investigation and returned to work with full clinical privileges Aug. 20. He retired in December and could not be reached by the Globe for comment.

The alleged assault occurred amid mounting frustration in the operating room after Lenkovsky and a surgeon made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to insert a breathing tube into a patient’s trachea, Murphy told VA police.

In a recent statement to the Globe, VA officials dismissed the allegation as “blatantly dishonest” and “disrespectful to actual assault victims, which Murphy is clearly not.”

They said that the contact was accidental and that Lenkovsky reflexively pushed away an oxygen bag that Murphy had allowed to obstruct his vision. VA officials described Murphy’s action as a “direct violation of protocol” by her at a pivotal and potentially life-threatening moment.

“In doing so, Lenkovsky inadvertently made contact with Ms. Murphy’s hand rather than the bag,” they said.

“This has shaken me to my soul,’’ Jennifer Keller, an anesthetist, said of her firing. (The Boston Globe)

Phillipa Lilienthal, an attorney who represents Murphy and Keller, said that the veteran nurse vehemently denies she breached protocol and that the hospital’s assertion to the Globe — nearly a full year after the incident — was the first time Murphy had heard that the VA faulted her actions during the surgery.

Murphy did not face any discipline for her alleged mistake and even was rewarded recently with a $400 performance bonus, Lilienthal said.

In addition, the attorney said, the VA’s “claim that she was not an assault victim is appalling and further victimizes her.”

Murphy told the Globe that she was initially afraid to report the assault “because I didn’t know what he [Lenkovsky] would do to me professionally,” but that Keller’s support helped her bring the complaint forward.

At the meeting with Rusch, Murphy said in her whistle-blower complaint, he asked “if there were any patterns to Lenkovsky’s behavior. The group was afraid to respond, so Keller responded.”

Keller told him that Lenkovsky had bullied and yelled at her, nurses, and anesthesia technicians, she said. In her whistle-blower complaint, Keller also said that Lenkovsky once showed her an image of former US senator Al Franken that had been photoshopped to make him appear to be groping a topless, pre-adolescent girl.

At the meeting, Keller said, Rusch assured the group that they would be protected from retaliation.

But on the day Lenkovsky returned to the hospital last August, Rusch suspended Keller’s clinical privileges, citing unspecified concerns that she potentially posed an “imminent threat to patient welfare.”

“I thought, this can’t be happening,” Keller recalled. “I got the letter, and I was trying to figure out what was wrong.”

Keller said she was not told at that time why she was considered a threat. Despite repeated requests, Keller said, she did not learn the specifics until Sept. 20, when the hospital’s acting chief of staff, Dr. Daniel O’Rourke, proposed she be fired, her attorney said.

By that time, two review committees already had met and recommended that Keller be dismissed, Lilienthal said. Keller had no knowledge of those meetings, her lawyer said.

Keller was fired after an internal review concluded she had walked out of a working operating room for brief periods during two surgical procedures on July 30, leaving an unlicensed, fourth-year medical student alone to provide anesthesiology care.

Keller has denied she was absent during the second procedure, but acknowledged that she stepped away during the first operation as a training exercise for the medical student.

“Dr. Keller’s intentional absences in the operating room have unnecessarily placed patients at risk, as well as placed students in a position to care for patients for which they do not have appropriate training, qualifications, or licenses,” O’Rourke wrote in his proposal that she be fired.

In a statement to the Globe, hospital officials said “the consensus opinion was this was a life-or-death situation that demanded an immediate correction.”

By leaving the operating room, the officials said, Keller had committed “an egregious breach of protocol during a surgery that could have led to the death of a patient.”

Hospital officials said their investigation also found that Keller had previously “left other anesthetized patients unattended” — a claim that Keller disputed — and that her dismissal was unrelated to Murphy’s assault allegation.

“The bottom line is that at VA, patient safety comes first in all that we do,” a hospital spokeswoman said. “It’s unfortunate that Murphy and Keller are either unaware of or don’t care about this crucial fact.”

The standards of the American Society of Anesthesiologists state that anesthetists “shall be present in the room throughout the conduct of all general anesthetics, regional anesthetics, and monitored anesthetic care.”

Keller described her absences during the first procedure — four times, for no more than a minute each time, a few yards from the patient — as a training exercise to observe the anesthesiology student from a distance. Once was from the entrance to a supply closet; the others were from behind doors in the surgical suite, she said.

Lilienthal said no problems were reported in the immediate aftermath of the two operations. Keller continued to be assigned to serious procedures, including an aortic bypass graft that is the most complex case the hospital handles, the attorney said.

“If you look at what happened and when, a lot of things don’t add up,” Lilienthal said, adding that Keller had compiled a spotless professional record during 17 years of clinical practice. Keller also is being represented by Andrea Amodeo-Vickery, an attorney who has represented whistle-blowers from the VA hospital in Manchester, N.H.

Levenson, the former VA medical services director for New England, said Keller was fired because she dared to confront more powerful men. On April 28, Rusch was appointed executive director of the hospital, which serves veterans in Vermont and four counties in New Hampshire.

“The saddest part of this whole process is that in an era when women can finally be taken seriously with regard to harassment complaints, the VA is still in the dark ages,” he said. “Instead of ‘#MeToo,’ the VA is ‘Old School.’ ”

Keller continues to teach at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, but her future as a physician could be in jeopardy. Lilienthal said the VA has reported her dismissal to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a database run by the US Department of Health and Human Services that collects negative information about physicians.

Keller, however, said she is determined to resume her career.

“I look forward to working as an anesthesiologist again,” said Keller, a single mother with two teenage children. “I will have a strong practice again.”

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
Small Nations Are True Pioneers Of Cryptocurrency Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com,"['Anatol Antonovici', 'Anja Van Oosterhout']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://bitcoinist.com/small-nations-are-true-pioneers-of-cryptocurrency-regulation/,"Bitcoin Regulation Small Nations Are True Pioneers Of Cryptocurrency Regulation

Whilst cryptocurrency regulation presents a huge headache to certain countries, it presents a huge opportunity to others. But how can a single asset class produce such polarised responses? Could it simply be down to ‘state of mind’?

Missing The Point

On the eighth day, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin… and very few people even noticed. Throughout the early years of its existence, it gradually began to amass followers through word of mouth. But it was still considered the niche domain of the geek, and nothing for authorities to devote resources to.

Everything changed forever in 2017 when bitcoin price went from $1k to $20k, and Bitcoin itself went from nerdy subculture to front-page news. Some made fortunes, some scammed greedy punters, governments had to do something.

The first thing should probably have been to research and understand exactly what they were dealing with. But that would take too long. Instead, why not just shoehorn this new cryptocurrency thing into existing financial regulations?

Because it isn’t like anything that came before. It’s new and full of potential. And over-zealous regulation could stifle innovation… Oops. Too late.

Ripping Up The Rulebook

Rather than follow the path of the many, adapting existing rules to fit something they were never designed for, some countries took a different track. Countries like Estonia, Malta, and Belarus realized that they didn’t have a rulebook for bitcoin and crypto to rip up, so they could start with a completely blank page.

Unhampered by legacy regulation, these countries were free to create an environment catering specifically for the benefit of their fledgling crypto industries. Imagine that. Being able to make up your own rules, to ensure you get ahead of the field.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko tasked entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya with developing regulations to boost the country’s tech sector following a meeting in March 2017. Working with local IT firms and lawyers, Prokopenya drafted guidelines to actively promote Belarus’s emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The idea was to create everything from scratch. To make sure that it is free in some of the aspects it needs to be free, and very stringent in other aspects.

So, the trick to regulating cryptocurrency would seem to be designing the regulations specifically for cryptocurrency.

Of course, there are those who believe in a total lack of regulation, and there are certain jurisdictions which provide this. But these also lack certain consumer protections which institutional investors tend to find rather a deal-breaker.

It remains to be seen whether bespoke regulatory approaches such as this will eventually inform global policy on cryptocurrency, or whether they will fall foul of any future global regulation. But for the meantime, small crypto-positive states are seeing large increases in investment and talent.

"California man behind $1 billion spinal surgery fraud hid millions from government, DOJ says",https://www.mercurynews.com,['Teri Sforza'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/mastermind-of-1-billion-spinal-surgery-fraud-hid-millions-from-government-doj-says/,"The imprisoned mastermind of a $1 billion spinal surgery scam faces new federal charges that he violated a court order to forfeit his classic car collection, including an iconic 1965 Aston Martin made famous by fictional British spy James Bond.

Michael Drobot, who operated Pacific Hospital Long Beach, has agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity and criminal contempt of court.

Drobot, 74, formerly of Corona del Mar, is serving a five-year sentence at Taft Correctional Institution in Kern County. He faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in federal prison on the new charges, and will be arraigned in coming weeks in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, according to the Department of Justice.

Drobot’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Drobot, 74, pleaded guilty in 2014 to orchestrating a scheme authorities dubbed Operation Spinal Cap, which paid more than $50 million in bribes to doctors and other health professionals in exchange for steering spinal surgeries and other procedures to his hospital. Former state Sen. Ron Calderon also was convicted of taking bribes from Drobot.

As part of his plea, Drobot was ordered by the court to forfeit $10 million to the United States government. So the Aston Martin on the auction block in August 2018 — along with his 1958 Porsche and his 1971 Mercedes-Benz — was a penance of sorts, helping to fulfill that obligation and provide restitution to victims.

The Aston alone was valued by RM Sotheby’s auctioneers at $1.2 million to $1.4 million, and ultimately sold for $1.5 million.

But rather than forwarding sale proceeds to the government, as promised, Drobot disobeyed the court order and illegally kept the proceeds for himself, the U.S. Department of Justice said in court filings this week. (Drobot No. 1, Drobot No. 2).

Drobot conveyed an interest in the Aston Martin to the classic car auction company in exchange for a $1 million advance on the sale proceeds on June 22, 2018, the DOJ said. That $1 million was wired to Drobot’s bank account and used “for personal expenses and not to satisfy the court’s forfeiture order. Drobot further admitted to laundering the money via transfers to third parties,” the DOJ said.

In February, the DOJ seized Drobot’s interest in his Newport Beach home and Perris business property to help satisfy the order, said spokesman Ciaran McEvoy.

Prosecutors have charged 17 people, and won 10 convictions, as part of Operation Spinal Cap, the $1 billion health care fraud scheme Drobot spearheaded. The accused hail from Manhattan Beach, Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Santa Ana, San Clemente and many other cities.

Patients wait

Thousands of patients received surgeries at Pacific Hospital not knowing that Drobot had bribed their physician to perform their surgery at Pacific Hospital, prosecutors said in court documents.

“The patients believed that they were receiving conflict-free medical advice when, in fact, (Drobot) illegally incentivized their physician to perform the surgery at Pacific Hospital,” they wrote.

Waiting not so patiently in the wings now, as the government’s mammoth probe proceeds, are those patients, who seek redress.

In an avalanche of lawsuits, more than 160 patients contend that cheap, nonsurgical-grade hardware may have been drilled into their bones during operations that might not have been necessary to begin with, leaving them in excruciating pain.

Their suits, in civil court, target doctors and hospitals allegedly involved in the scheme — but those suits are in a deep freeze so as not to interfere with the DOJ’s criminal probe.

Doctors and hospitals targeted by those lawsuits — who have not been charged in the federal criminal probe — deny wrongdoing, including knowingly using inferior product in surgeries. Drobot has said his companies never bought or used any knock-off screws or parts for spinal surgeries.

How much of that $10 million might patients see?

Drobot’s forfeited money goes into a government forfeiture fund, and there’s a process called remission where victims can request their share, said DOJ spokesman McEvoy.

“It would be fair and just — and seems to me the only right answer — for the bulk of whatever’s recovered from Drobot and his co-defendants to go to the actual patients who are suffering,” said attorney Justin Berger, who represents whistleblowers in the case.

Attorneys have asked the court to allow some of the patients’ civil lawsuits to move forward, and that will be considered on Tuesday, July 30.

“We’re hopeful that — given the passage of time, that patients continue to live in pain and that patients continue to die — some or all of these suits will be set for trial soon,” Berger said. “There are doctors still walking around as free men without any indictments — I hope this means there will be continued cooperation and the government will go after all the wrongdoers.”"
Textile Waste Has Surged 811% Since the '60s According to the EPA,https://www.highsnobiety.com,"['Isabelle Hore-Thorburn', 'Weekend Staff Writer']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/textile-waste-increase-epa-report/,"According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), textile waste has increased by 811 percent between 1960 and 2015. The majority of this waste is made up of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW encompasses discarded clothing, as well as small furniture, carpets, tires, and footwear.

The EPA calculated that in 2015, clothing and footwear produced 11.9 million tons of waste and 4.5 percent of total MSW. Decades of data gathering evidence a dramatic increase in textile waste, which grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to more than 16 million tons in 2015.

Jackie King, executive director of Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART), told Supply Chain Dive that the problem has worsened significantly in the last decade. She explained that “a lot of the ‘fast fashion’ clothing is not very well made and might not last through more than a few washes before ending up in the landfill.”

Last week, the BBC reported that the next 18 months will be critical in dealing with the global warming crisis, among other environmental challenges. Read how brands such as DURA are responding.

DOJ approves T-Mobile-Sprint deal with conditions,https://www.axios.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.axios.com/doj-approves-t-mobile-sprint-deal-with-conditions-5025138d-4f25-4103-82ef-8e6ce0dce21a.html,"The Justice Department and five states reached the settlement with Sprint and T-Mobile, which calls on the companies to:

Sell Sprint's prepaid brands (Boost, Virgin and Sprint Prepaid) to Dish Network.

Make available at least 20,000 cell sites to Dish

Divest some spectrum in the 800MHz range to Dish

Provide Dish with ""robust access"" to the T-Mobile network for at least 7 years while Dish builds out its 5G network

engage in ""good faith"" negotiations about leasing some of Dish's existing 600MHz spectrum

Yes, but: Dish already has been sitting on a bunch of spectrum that it has yet to use and many wireless industry experts doubt its ability to emerge as a serious fourth player in the market.

What they're saying:

Assistant Attorney General Makin Delrahim said that the merger ""would be anti-competitive” if not for the remedies the agency includes in its settlement.

Former FCC official Gigi Sohn: ""The state AGs who sued to block the merger shouldn’t be fooled by this weak attempt to maintain competition in the mobile wireless market.... A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It's a mobile Frankenstein.""

T-Mobile CEO John Legere noted in a statement that the Dish deal won't change ""previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation"" projections.

Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the deal will help fulfill two decades of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments. Dish also notes in a press release that the deal requires it to ""use its spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network covering at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023"" or else ""make voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury of up to $2.2 billion.”

What's next: A court will have to approve the deal, and 10 other states have separately sued to block it. Those states have asked the court for more time in the event of a DoJ settlement that changed the terms of the deal, as is now the case."
Trump Labels Elijah Cummings 'Racist',https://www.usnews.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/ken-walshs-washington/articles/2019-07-29/trump-labels-elijah-cummings-racist,"President Donald Trump starts the week at the center of another racial firestorm. He is lashing out at Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., an African American and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which has been conducting various investigations of the Trump administration.

Trump criticized Cummings and his home town of Baltimore throughout the weekend in unusually harsh terms. The president said Cummings should be more concerned with improving horrendous conditions in his Baltimore-based congressional district than trying to improve life for migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, which Cummings has been trying to do. Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday, ""If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical 'oversight' is a joke!""

Trump also tweeted Sunday, ""There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!""

Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, defended Trump Sunday. Asked if he understood that Trump's comments were offensive to some Americans, Mulvaney told CBS News, ""I understand that everything that Donald Trump says is offensive to some people,"" Asked if he understood why some people would consider Trump's comments as racist, Mulvaney said, ""I understand why, but that doesn't mean that it's racist. The president is pushing back against what he sees as wrong. It's how he's done it in the past, and he'll continue to do it in the future.""

In a series of tweets Saturday and Sunday, Trump wrote that conditions in Cummings' district, which includes part of Baltimore and is majority African American, are ""FAR WORSE and more dangerous"" than those at the border between the United States and Mexico. Trump said Cummings' district is a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.""

""If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,"" Trump wrote. He said Cummings' ""district is considered the 'Worst in the USA"" and ""no human being would want to live there.""

Trump called Cummings a ""brutal bully"" for criticizing Border Patrol officials about conditions at the southern border. Trump said the congressman ""spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through 'Oversight.'....He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district!"" And Trump said, ""Statistically, Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry, but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!"" Trump gave no details to back up these accusations. On Sunday, Trump again tweeted that Cummings ""has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore.""

Cummings, who has a long history as a civil rights leader, replied on Twitter, ""Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.""

Trump critics saw racism in his outbursts. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was born and raised in Baltimore and whose father and brother each served as the city's mayor, wrote on Twitter that Cummings ""is a champion in the Congress and the country for civil rights and economic justice, a beloved leader in Baltimore, and deeply valued colleague. We all reject racist attacks against him and support his steadfast leadership.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential front runner, wrote on Twitter that Trump is ""unfit to hold the office"" of president. ""A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.,"" Biden said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top Democratic presidential candidate, told CNN, ""It's unbelievable that we have a President of the United States who attacks American cities, who attacks Americans. That is a disgrace.""

Trump critics point out that two weeks ago, he attacked four Democratic congresswomen of color who have criticized him and said they should ""go back"" to the countries where they came from. All are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States and the fourth is a naturalized citizen who came to the USA from Somalia as a refugee.

Trump's criticism of the four legislators prompted the Democrat-controlled House to pass a resolution condemning his remarks as racist."
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
How can $2 million in U.S. EPA Trash-Free grants curb the Great Lakes plastic problem?,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Laura Johnston', 'Ljohnston Cleveland.Com']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/07/how-can-2-million-in-us-epa-trash-free-grants-curb-the-great-lakes-plastic-problem.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – How can $2 million in U.S. EPA grants clean up the plastic-plagued Great Lakes?

Local environmental groups – including Surfrider, Alliance for the Great Lakes and Drink Local. Drink Tap – are interested in applying for grants, announced this month as part of the annual $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

But some experts say the money will do little to solve the problem of 22 million pounds of plastic dumped into the Great Lakes each year.

The only real solution is to stop making more plastic, said Sherri A. Mason, sustainability coordinator at Penn State University’s Behrend campus.

“It’s money and I appreciate money being put toward anything,” Mason said. “If you really want to solve this problem, you don’t focus on removing the trash... That’s a Band-aid on a gaping wound when really what we need are stitches.”

The EPA plans to release details in October. A spokeswoman said the cleanup and preventing of all marine and shoreline trash will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 and that plastics will likely be an important component of many applications.

“This first-of-its-kind trash-focused grant program is yet another example of progress being made under the GLRI,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp. “Thanks to this funding, a number of Great Lakes communities can receive a meaningful assist in removing trash and litter from beaches, shorelines and waterways where cleanup projects are sorely needed.”

Erin Huber, director of Drink Local. Drink Tap, hopes the grants reward efforts to “stop creating the trash in the first place.”

Since 2010, Drink Local volunteers have picked up 6,681 pounds of trash from Cleveland beaches.

“Clean ups, though we do them, are a last resort,” Huber said. “I worry that this grant might be a shiny thing to take our attention away from real issues - unsustainable consumption, unsustainable plastic (aka fossil fuel) use.”

How big is the problem?

Lake Erie has 46,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer, rivaling the dirtiest part of the world’s oceans, Mason said in the 2018 State of the Great Lakes speech at the City Club of Cleveland.

The earth adds about 300 million tons of plastic every year.

Nearly half of it is packaging.

About 10 percent is recycled -- a number that won’t likely increase since plastic is so cheap to manufacture.

About 10 percent ends up in waterways.

Much of it -- including fast-food straws, cigar tips and plastic bottle caps -- comes flushed from city streets throughout the watershed, down storm drains and into the lake, according to a Rochester Institute of Technology study. The trash washes up on shore, making up about 80 percent of the litter on beaches.

Winds and currents usually push the trash to the east and southern shores of each Great Lake.

In 2018, more than 14,300 volunteers worked with the Alliance for the Great Lakes at 900 beach clean ups, over all five Great Lakes, collecting 35,600 pounds of trash. About 87 percent of that trash was plastic.

“We see a litter issue on a lot of beaches,” Alliance spokeswoman Jennifer Caddick said. “It’s going to have to be a bigger solution than just beach clean ups.”

What are people doing already?

Local governments and businesses have taken their own actions.

In May, Cuyahoga County Council voted 8-3 to enact a plastic bag ban, the first in Ohio, in part to keep plastic out of the lake. County Councilwoman Sunny Simon, who pushed for years for the ban, said county residents use 320 million plastic bags each year. The Republican-dominated state legislature, though, may ban the bag ban.

Many Northeast Ohio restaurants have eliminated plastic straws and have switched Styrofoam take-out containers for biodegradable options.

What else could we do?

Grants could pay for all sorts of projects and programs.

Take the invention of Thomas Zung, a distinguished senior fellow at Stanford University, who won Cleveland Water Alliance’s ErieHack competition in June with a geodesic dome that collects trash from storm sewer outflows. A crane then empties and dumps the trash.

Zung and his team of Cleveland college students, won $40,000 for the idea from Erie Hack. He plans to apply for a Trash-Free grant, too.

Tim Hoellein, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago, who studies trash in the Great Lakes, plans to apply for a grant to boost his research, which includes analyzing data from Alliance for the Great Lakes clean ups. The number of cigarette butts, one of the top items found on beaches, has dropped over the last 15 years.

“There’s some room for optimism,” Hoellein said. “A suite of public policies can have a positive outcome over the long term.”

Hoellein appreciates the Trump administration’s spotlight on the trash problem. So far, he said, garbage is not a political issue. Everyone, regardless of party, can see it.

(That said, the Trump campaign is selling packs of plastic straws labeled “Make straws great again.” Plastic straws account for about 1 percent of the plastic in the oceans, according to Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.)

What’s the problem with trash?

Cleaning it up costs cities money. Its ugliness may detour tourism. There are public health concerns with people exposed to diapers, needles or tampons, plus wildlife problems for fish and birds who eat it or get entangled in it.

Hoellein’s team has analyzed 250 fish, 95 percent of which have plastic in their stomach. The plastic may be as small as a microfiber from a fleece jacket that washed off in the laundry. “But it’s almost universally there,” he said.

Lake lovers hope the federal focus on trash will help reverse the trash flow.

Said the Alliance’s Cleveland office outreach coordinator, Destinee Henton: “I applaud the EPA for their commitment to cleaning up our most precious natural resource.”

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

DOJ’s tech probe needs to be mindful of corporate harassment,https://nypost.com,"['Jonathon Trugman', 'July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/dojs-tech-probe-needs-to-be-mindful-of-corporate-harassment/,"The Department of Justice last week launched a wide-ranging antitrust review to determine if the largest technology companies are, or have been, stifling competition.

The four that are reported to be most focused on — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google — account for almost a million high-paying jobs with good benefits, and are massive contributors to this year’s strong projected 2.5 percent-plus GDP growth rate.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and Snap all reported earnings last week. Aside from Amazon’s — affected by a big investment in faster delivery — they were pretty impressive. (Apple reports this week.) So people clearly are using these platforms to conduct commerce and communication.

There are always unintended consequences of big government trying to wrestle with an industry. The DOJ needs to be mindful of that, and not return to the Obama days of excess corporate harassment.

While the privacy issues are real and absolutely need to continue to be addressed, the anticompetitive aspect seems to me rather nonsensical.

Silicon Valley’s growth machine is one of the bright lights of the economy, not only in the US, but globally.

So I like the way the FTC handled the Facebook settlement announced on Wednesday. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty due to the privacy issues and the use of people’s data, as happened in the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Those who say that’s not enough money don’t get it. It’s not about the money, it’s about the behavior. The FTC, by requiring Zuckerberg’s certification that its newly-agreed-to privacy rules are adhered to, found a great way to truly address any issues going forward without inhibiting growth and innovation.

These companies don’t stifle competition; they finance and foster it!

Let’s not give China or any other advanced economies a technological advantage by hampering our own geniuses and shooting ourselves in the foot."
U.S. Satellite Operators Urge Commerce Department to Revise Proposed Commercial Remote Sensing Regulations,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-satellite-operators-urge-commerce-090000762.html,"WESTMINSTER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Proposed regulations would be a step backward for U.S. industry, giving foreign firms a competitive advantage

U.S. satellite operators Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (MAXR.TO), Planet Labs, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global today urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to revise its proposed commercial remote sensing regulations, which as drafted would put U.S. firms at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global recently submitted a joint response to the Commerce Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking objecting to the newly proposed rules. While U.S. satellite operators appreciate the Department’s recognition of the risk to American leadership in space that comes from overly burdensome regulation, the proposed regulations would undermine U.S. competitiveness, impair U.S. innovation and deter investment in the U.S. commercial space industry. Commenters urged the Commerce Department to significantly revise the proposed regulations to take a more narrowly tailored approach to ensure the pressing need for continued U.S. leadership in commercial space is more appropriately balanced with other regulatory interests.

The U.S. commercial space industry provides critical products and services that support disaster and humanitarian crisis response, national and global security interests and enhance the location-enabled services that billions of people around the world use every day. Addressing the lack of transparency, operational uncertainty and institutionalized delays that impair the ability of the U.S. industry to bring innovative products and services to market should be the primary focus of the Commerce Department’s efforts. For example, license requests to bring new commercial satellite imagery capabilities to market can take years to approve, operators have little visibility into the decision-making process and operating licenses are subject to retroactive modifications after investment has already been made and systems are operating. By failing to address these issues, the proposed regulations put at risk continued U.S. leadership in the global commercial space industry, including the satellite imagery market, which is alone projected to reach $3 billion by 2020.

“The U.S. commercial space industry needs smart regulations that promote innovation, encourage competitiveness and bolster national security, and unfortunately the Commerce Department’s draft regulations fall far short of these goals,” said Dr. Walter Scott, Maxar CTO. “Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global urge U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Space Council to intervene and ensure that new regulations allow American space firms to continue to lead in this dynamic global industry.”

“The draft regulations represent a three-decade step backward,” said Robbie Schingler, Planet’s Co-founder. “This is cold water thrown onto a thriving ecosystem with rapidly changing space architectures, many new entrants and novel business models. We strongly urge regulators to take a strategic view and create a forward-leaning environment that opens up near-Earth space to efficient, secure and trusted commercial enterprise. Building new industries bolsters American competitiveness and grows the economy, which fuels national security. Should this rule progress without significant modification, it will represent a direct threat to 21st century U.S. national security.”

MORE (D-Mass.) will introduce a bill to abolish the death penalty after the Department of Justice announced Thursday that it will resume capital punishment for the first time in nearly two decades.

The bill seeks to “prohibit the use of the death penalty for any violation of federal law, and for other purposes.” It also calls for any person sentenced to death prior to law's enactment to be resentenced.

“The death penalty has no place in a just society,” Pressley tweeted, along with an image of the legislation.

MORE said in a statement Thursday.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding. The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."
The Difference Between How The FTC And DOJ Are Dealing With Facebook,https://adexchanger.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://adexchanger.com/platforms/the-difference-between-how-the-ftc-and-doj-are-dealing-with-facebook/,"Facebook is getting poked by both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, but that doesn’t mean it’s facing two separate antitrust probes in the United States.

“It would be unprecedented, not to mention duplicative, for the DOJ and the FTC to be investigating the same company for essentially the same conduct,” said George Hay, a Cornell law professor and antitrust scholar.

So, what’s the difference?

Last week, Facebook tacked an almost offhanded disclosure onto the end of the press release announcing its second quarter earnings . Under the heading “Other Matters,” Facebook confirmed that the FTC had launched a formal antitrust investigation into the company June, and noted that the Department of Justice is planning to kick off an antitrust review of the “market-leading online platforms.”

It’s easy to conflate the two. But there’s a marked difference between the full-blown investigation the FTC is embarking on and the DOJ’s inquiry into whether and how large online platforms, which the department doesn’t call out by name – though doubtlessly includes Facebook and its big tech cohorts, like Google and Amazon – achieved their market power.

“What the DOJ is doing is taking a big-picture look, which basically means getting a task force together of lawyers and economists that will read publicly available information and decide, in a generic sense, what the common antitrust problems are between these platforms,” Hay said.

If the DOJ turns up anything on Facebook, or Amazon, for that matter, it’ll most likely share whatever it finds with the FTC and give the agency clearance.

“The FTC and DOJ have significantly overlapping antitrust powers and typically coordinate their efforts,” said Harold Li, VP of VPN service ExpressVPN.

As was first reported early last month, the FTC and the DOJ are divvying up their scrutiny into the big tech biggies, with the former responsible for Facebook and Amazon and the latter taking on Google and Apple.

And both are bound by the same laws as they do so, although their powers vary a bit.

Unlike the DOJ, the FTC has consumer protection authority, which is why it was the one to tangle with and eventually fine Facebook $5 billion for its Cambridge Analytica-related privacy sins. By the same token, only the DOJ can bring criminal actions. But on the antitrust front, both are operating by the same rules and have essentially the same powers.

“Their guardrails are the law,” Hay said.

And in the event either agency wants to take action against one of the companies under its purview, it’s got to be prepared to litigate. Neither the FTC or the DOJ is an administrative agency, which means they can’t force Facebook, or anyone, to do anything, without reaching a settlement or taking a company to court.

“We would’ve had years of litigation and much less relief later than we do now,” FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in justification of why the commission settled with Facebook.

It’s far too early to say what the FTC’s new antitrust investigation into Facebook will uncover, or if the DOJ will bring anything new to light through its big tech inquiry.

But it’s clear neither agency wants to be seen sitting on its hands. US lawmakers have been asking increasingly hard questions at congressional hearing after congressional hearing, and governments around the world are also starting to dig in .

Just last week, Australia’s antitrust watchdog said it’s planning to create a dedicated office to more closely monitor Facebook and Google."
DOJ won't prosecute contempt citation against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/doj-contempt-wont-prosecute-barr-ross/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice won't prosecute the attorney general or Commerce secretary after the House voted earlier this month to hold them in criminal contempt, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Wednesday.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.
