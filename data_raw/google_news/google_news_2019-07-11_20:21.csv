"Trump rails against ‘Fake News’ in bizarre tirade, warns industry will fold when he leaves office",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rails-against-fake-news-in-bizarre-tirade-warns-industry-will-fold-when-he-leaves-office,"President Trump teed off on the news media in a bizarre Twitter rant Thursday morning ahead of a big social media summit at the White House slated for later in the day.

The string of tweets attacked the news media and claimed the industry would go out of business when he leaves office, even suggesting outlets would be forced to endorse him this cycle for the sake of their own survival.

He went on to alternately praise himself, lob insults at familiar targets in the 2020 Democratic field and even joke about serving more than two terms.

TRUMP DECLARES VICTORY OVER 'DEEP STATE'

“The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today. Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion, we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship.” Trump began. “A big subject today at the White House Social Media Summit will be the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer. The Fake News Media will also be there, but for a limited period.”

He continued: “The Fake News is not as important, or as powerful, as Social Media. They have lost tremendous credibility since that day in November, 2016, that I came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future First Lady,” Trump tweeted. (The president apparently confused his dates, as the escalator ride he referenced happened in June 2015 when he announced his presidential bid.)

“When I ultimately leave office in six years, or maybe 10 or 14 (just kidding), they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility, or approval, from the public. That’s why they will all be Endorsing me at some point, one way or the other.”

Thursday's tweet was not the first time the president joked about staying in office past the two-term limit. Last month, Trump tweeted a video about running ""4eva.""

The president went on Thursday to slam 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, deploying his nicknames for former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- and suggesting the country would rather have him as president, as he praised his own physical and mental attributes.

“Could you imagine having Sleepy Joe Biden, or Alfred E. Newman or a very nervous and skinny version of Pocahontas (1/1024th), as your President, rather than what you have now, so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!” Trump tweeted. “Sorry to say that even Social Media would be driven out of business along with, and finally, the Fake News Media!”

The president’s Twitter screed comes as his social media account has been in the headlines. A federal appeals court decision this week said Trump is no longer allowed to block people on Twitter over statements he does not like.

The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals noted that because Trump uses Twitter to communicate with the public about his administration, and his account is open to the public for people to comment on his posts, it warrants constitutional free speech protection under the First Amendment.

“We do conclude,” the opinion said, “that the First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise‐open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees.”

APPEALS COURT RULES TRUMP VIOLATED FIRST AMENDMENT BY BLOCKING TWITTER USERS

According to court documents, Trump admitted that he blocked the plaintiffs in the case in 2017 after they posted tweets that “criticized him or his policies.” Once they were blocked, they were no longer able to view Trump’s tweets while logged in, and no longer had access to reply to tweets or view comment threads on Trump’s Twitter page.

The First Amendment prohibits government discrimination against a person’s free speech based on their viewpoint. Trump claimed that his Twitter account is private, so the First Amendment should not apply.

"Trump’s latest morning of tweets was off the rails, even by his standards",https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/11/20690150/trump-tweets-off-the-rails-july-11-2019,"Two and a half years into the Donald Trump presidency, Americans are used to Trump posting off-the-rails tweets. But Thursday morning still stood out.

Trump body-shamed Sen. Elizabeth Warren while using a slur to demean her, mistakenly tagged a random retired teacher who is not of fan of his while insulting her fellow 2020 contender Pete Buttigieg, expressed confusion about when his presidential campaign began, joked about illegally staying in power beyond a second term, brazenly gaslighted about his indebtedness to banks, and said he thinks he’ll win in Minnesota in 2020 simply because a city council there decided to stop saying the Pledge of Allegiance before meetings.

All of this happened before 8 am.

Each of these tweets, by themselves, would’ve been highly abnormal public statements coming from any other president. For Trump, they are not. Still, the volume with which he posted them on Thursday morning was remarkable.

Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s odd tweets on Thursday, in the order in which he posted them.

Trump is confused about when his campaign began

While hyping the sham social media summit that’s set to take place at the White House on Thursday, Trump tried to take shots at “The Fake News,” which he claimed has “lost tremendous credibility since that day in November, 2016, that I came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future First Lady.”

(Trump deleted and reposted a number of tweets, including this one, in a thread that contained errors, but not before I captured screengrabs of the originals.)

There’s just one problem: The escalator incident Trump referred to actually happened happened in Trump Tower 17 months before November 2016, in June 2015, just before the speech in which he launched his presidential campaign. While Trump’s election night victory speech also took place in Trump Tower, there was no footage of him coming down an escalator on that night. He appears to have mixed it up.

Remembering when your presidential campaign began seems like a pretty odd thing to get confused about. But Trump was just getting started.

Trump “jokes” about staying in office for for 14 more years

Trump segued from a tweet expressing confusion about when his campaign began to one in which he joked about staying in office for as many as 14 more years.

This is far from the first time Trump has indicated that he’s interested in staying in office for more than two terms. He’s said he does so to troll the media, but given his open admiration for dictators abroad and repeated efforts to undermine the rule of law at home, his jokes about becoming president for life really aren’t funny.

Trump mistakenly tags a retired teacher who isn’t a fan of his

In the same tweet in which he joked about illegally extending his term in office, Trump, while trying to demean South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for purportedly resembling cartoon character Alfred E. Neuman, mistakenly tagged an account belonging to a retired teacher who, based on his recent retweets, is clearly is not a fan of the president.

Trump mistakenly tagged a random retired teacher who hates him. This is the guy who has the nuke codes. pic.twitter.com/YDSjMxSSSe — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 11, 2019

This isn’t the first time Trump has mistakenly tagged the wrong account on Twitter — he did so as recently as two weeks ago. But that he continues to make easily avoidable mistakes like this is a sign of how little vetting his tweets get before they’re posted for the world to see, as well as a broader recklessness.

Trump body-shames Elizabeth Warren while using a racial slur

After insulting Buttigieg, Trump demeaned Elizabeth Warren by describing her as “a very nervous and skinny version of Pocahontas.”

“Pocahontas” has become Trump’s go-to slur while mocking Warren and her ill-fated attempt to claim Native American ancestry. But attacking Warren’s demeanor and looks is a new twist, and comes while first lady Melania Trump is purportedly busying herself with anti-cyberbullying work as part of her broader “Be Best” campaign.

Trump went on to compare Warren unfavorably with himself, describing himself as “so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!” But note that in that very same tweet, Trump revealed a confusion about fractions. According to an analysis of the results of the DNA test Warren released, her fractional Native American ancestry is somewhere between 1/64 and 1/1024. But in writing “1000/24th,” Trump got it backward.

“Stable Genius,” indeed.

Trump thinks he’ll win Minnesota over a silly Pledge of Allegiance controversy

Trump then turned his attention to Minnesota, where the city council in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park recently voted to stop saying the Pledge of Allegiance before meetings. The story has been a major topic this week on Trump’s favorite television show, Fox & Friends.

The latest polling indicates that Trump’s approval rating is 16 points underwater in Minnesota, but Trump seems to think that the St. Louis Park City Council’s move will be enough for him to overcome that deficit and win a state that hasn’t gone for a Republican since Richard Nixon in 1972.

The Pledge of Allegiance to our great Country, in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, is under siege. That is why I am going to win the Great State of Minnesota in the 2020 Election. People are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2019

Trump’s tweet suggests that instead of using his power to do things that make people’s lives better, he thinks a winning strategy heading into 2020 is identity grievance issues. The polling in Minnesota begs to differ, but then again, Trump doesn’t buy polls that aren’t favorable to him.

Trump gaslights about his indebtedness to banks

Hours after the New York Times published a report about the business relationship between Deutsche Bank and Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender with ties to Bill Clinton and Trump, the president proclaimed that he doesn’t need to do business with banks because “I didn’t (don’t) need their money (old fashioned, isn’t it?).” He went on to acknowledge but downplay his dealings with Deutsche Bank.

....And remember, a bank that I did use years ago, the now badly written about and maligned Deutsche Bank, was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world! They wanted my business, and so did many others! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2019

This is brazen gaslighting. In March, the New York Times reported that Trump took out an astounding $2 billion in loans from Deutsche Bank and was cut off on two separate occasions by the bank because executives realized he was a risky client. That reporting came a little less than a year after news that Trump still owed as much as $480 million to a number of banks and financial services firms, including but not limited to Deutsche Bank.

And, of course, while Trump tries to brag about his business acumen, it’s worth remembering the Times’s bombshell reporting from last October about how he was gifted at least $413 million by his father, then participated in “dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud” to increase that fortune.

Some of Trump’s most bizarre mornings of tweeting have come amid bad news cycles for him or when bad news is on the horizon; for instance, as I detailed at the time, Trump posted a string of increasingly bizarre tweets shortly after the Mueller report was released publicly in April. But these Thursday tweets come as his approval rating hits historic highs — he’s still 9 points underwater but, according to a new Washington Post/ABC poll, at the highest point of his presidency — and with no obvious reason for him to be melting down. Perhaps there is less method to the mayhem than there sometimes seems.

NASA Abruptly Reassigns Top Human Exploration Program Officials as Trump Moon Mandate Looms,https://gizmodo.com,"['Tom Mckay', 'About The Author', '... An Upperclassman Who Had Been Researching Terrorist Groups Online.', '- Washington Post']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/nasa-abruptly-reassigns-top-human-exploration-program-o-1836267318,"Photo: Bill Ingalls (AP)

NASA’s longtime associate administrator for its human exploration program, William Gerstenmaier, has been re-assigned to be a special adviser to NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard in what seems like a fairly clear demotion, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.



Gerstenmaier, who has worked for NASA since 1977, had overseen “some of NASA’s most high-profile programs and is known as a steady and methodical force at the agency’s headquarters,” the Post wrote, recently working with Commercial Crew Program contractors Boeing and SpaceX on their replacements for the retired Space Shuttle. His re-assignment appears to be the result of the White House’s push to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 instead of its prior goal of 2028, an initiative abruptly set by Vice President Mike Pence in March and that perhaps not coincidentally would overlap with the end of Donald Trump’s second term in office.

NASA’s assistant deputy associate administrator of human exploration, Bill Hill, the second in command, was also reassigned to a special adviser position with NASA Associate Administrator Steve Jurczyk.

“As you know, NASA has been given a bold challenge to put the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024, with a focus on the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote in an email to staff, according to the Post. “In an effort to meet this challenge, I have decided to make leadership changes to the Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Mission Directorate.”

Former astronaut and current Deputy Associate Administrator Ken Bowersox will now take over leadership of the human exploration program, Bridenstine reportedly wrote in his email.

In addition to the Commercial Crew Program, Gerstenmaier has overseen the operations of the International Space Station (which the Trump administration has floated plans to privatize) and NASA’s Space Launch System (which the Post noted has frustrated the Trump administration due to being “years behind schedule and way over budget”). As the Post reported, he was also overseeing the lunar return program, Artemis, which the White House was similarly frustrated with due to its belief that the project isn’t moving fast enough.

In fact, per the Verge, on Wednesday, Gerstenmaier had appeared before Congress to talk up Artemis during a hearing on the future of the ISS and low Earth orbit exploration:

“NASA’s Artemis program will build a sustainable, open architecture that returns humanity to our nearest neighbor,” Gerstenmaier wrote in his witness testimony for the hearing. “We are building for the long term, and this time are going to the Moon to stay. We are designing an open, durable, reusable architecture that will support deep space exploration for decades to come.”

It remains unclear, according to the Verge, whether Congress will approve the $1.6 billion in additional funding for the Artemis program requested by the White House. The administration suggested the additional money come from the Pell Grant college financial aid program, the Verge reported.

Some experts say the White House hasn’t proposed a clear reason for astronauts to actually return to the moon by 2024 and that the rushed timetable could result in serious safety concerns even if it was fully funded, according to Popular Science. Prior reporting by the Post has suggested that many NASA employees are skeptical that the target is achievable without gutting other missions or that the agency currently has the funding necessary to achieve it. Bridenstine has acknowledged he needs $20 billion to 30 billion on top of NASA’s current budget to pull off the mission, while the president himself has seemed... let’s say, confused about NASA’s directives.

However, Pence’s 2024 mandate is not so much a target as a thinly veiled threat. In his speech announcing the initiative, he said, “If NASA is not currently capable of landing American astronauts on the Moon in five years, we need to change the organization, not the mission.”

Of note, a recent report from Ars Technica citing “multiple sources inside and outside NASA” reported disputes between the agency’s human spaceflight administrators and the White Houses House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Those sources said that OMB was trying to kill Gateway, a tiny planned Moon-orbiting space station intended to serve as a midpoint between Earth and a lunar landing site, under the belief the mission could be cheaper and faster without it. They also said they suspected Gerstenmaier was pushing for Gateway due to the possibility that a Democratic nominee could win the election and revert to the original 2028 date or restore Gateway’s original purpose as a “deep space proving ground” for a Mars mission.

“When someone like Elizabeth Warren gets elected, what are they going to do?” a source told Ars Technica. “Are they going to say we love the Trump space idea? Hell no. They’re going to say we don’t want to do that. Gerstenmaier has been around this block before. He’s trying to cover all of the bases.”

Gerstenmaier also said earlier this year that NASA would not skip the “green run” test of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket’s core stage, which NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel has advised is critical to “ensure safe operations,” according to Ars Technica. Skipping the test could save six to nine months and give NASA more leeway in achieving the 2024 target, and Bridenstine has suggested it could be shortened or skipped.

However, the safety panel warned that “[s]horter-duration engine firings at the launch pad will not achieve an understanding of the operational margins, and could result in severe consequences.” NASA Spaceflight recently reported that though NASA leadership recommended the test, a final determination on its status has not been made."

Vietor began by citing Ivanka's presence at the G20 summit and mocked her for trying to connect with world leaders.

""Trump's team went on this foreign trip and they started having Ivanka record readouts of these meetings,"" he said. ""Back when Ben and I were at the NSC, you would go up and spend like 90 minutes talking about all the things that were discussed... really dig deep on policy.

She's not doing any of that. So, she's jumping into photo ops with world leaders. She has no subject matter expertise.""

Vietor continued: ""But it's also an actual problem because if I'm watching the United States from afar I'm wondering when the U.S. transitioned into a constitutional monarchy.""

Rhodes said Ivanka has no business being in the same room as world leaders and asked if the unprecedented action is just a way for Trump to provide his daughter with a political fantasy camp.

""I think we can't get over the embarrassment here. The G20 is the most important collection of countries in the world,"" he said.

Like that, we have like the daughter of the president just like butting into conversations with these world leaders?

""Clearly Trump is also like bending the rules. Jamming his daughter and son in law, who by the way also have all kinds of business interests floating around in these different countries -- just jamming them in there. So what? So she can have fantasy camp as a diplomat. Like so she can play at secretary -- madame secretary or something?""

Vietor said Ivanka's work at the G20 was likely a stepping stone for her to become ambassador to the United Nations and that's when Rhodes responded by comparing Trump and his daughter to ""House of Cards"" villains Frank and Claire Underwood.

Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739860400/broken-promises-teachers-sue-u-s-over-student-loans-that-werent-forgiven,"Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

"Roofing, paving, artisanal bread: Feds look to kick-start law that will free hundreds of inmates",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/11/first-step-act-doj-looks-prepare-inmates-early-release-prison-justice-reform/1691490001/,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Set in the foothills of the soaring Rocky Mountains, the mud-colored cluster of Depression-era structures has been a fixture in the federal penal system for decades.

Although just 10 miles south of Denver, notoriety has rarely found its way here except on the occasions when the Federal Correctional Institute Englewood’s worn cellblocks have housed the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich

Now, the 320-acre compound – distinguished by coils of razor wire and guard tower – is poised to play a leading role in a major criminal justice experiment.

Justice Department officials, including newly-installed Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, have cut a path to this unlikely place in recent days to tout a series of rehabilitation programs that could be key to supporting the early release and re-entry of waves of federal inmates set to be released as part of a criminal justice overhaul approved by Congress last year.

Inside Englewood, a culinary arts program is training aspiring chefs to pump out artisanal breads, pastries and cakes. An architectural drafting operation, manned by inmates, has produced designs for hundreds of chain restaurants and is assisting with a flood prevention project for the Port Authority of New York.

The prison’s signature enterprise, however, may be its most promising. Thirteen inmates are part of a roofing and road paving crew that travels the country more than seven months of the year tending to repairs and new construction at federal government installations scattered from the Great Lakes to New England. The crew members, many of whom have acquired valuable commercial drivers’ licenses while in prison and the skills to operate heavy machinery, have saved the federal government nearly $30 million in labor costs during the past three years, federal authorities said.

""I never thought I would get a chance to do something like this in prison,"" said Littlelee Ragsdale, a 36-year-old Wyoming man who is in the midst of a nine-year term for methamphetamine and heroin distribution. ""This a great opportunity for a real career outside of here. It's not just one of those jobs to get by. Re-entry (to the free world) is now a realistic goal."" (Photo: Ross Taylor for USA TODAY)

""I never thought I would get a chance to do something like this in prison,"" said Littlelee Ragsdale, a 36-year-old Wyoming man who is in the midst of a nine-year term for methamphetamine and heroin distribution. ""This a great opportunity for a real career outside of here. It's not just one of those jobs to get by. Re-entry (to the free world) is now a realistic goal.""

Leaning on the promise of Englewood’s programs and others like them scattered across the Bureau of Prisons system, Attorney General William Barr later this month is expected to unveil a tool that could shave years from the sentences of non-violent offenders like Ragsdale as part of the First Step Act, a sweeping law designed to reduce the federal prison population while easing offenders' transition back to their communities. Congress approved the law last year with support from both parties.

Barr is set to lay out rules on July 19 for evaluating federal inmates that could speed their path toward release. On the same day, a separate provision of the law will prompt the release of an estimated 2,200 offenders based on a re-calculation of the credit they receive for good behavior while in custody.

The new law represents a sea change in criminal justice policy which once advocated for the harshest punishments possible for offenders, including non-violent drug addicts who were swept up in en mass during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. The reversal, largely driven by spiraling prison costs and racial disparities in the enforcement of such punitive measures has garnered support of an unusual political alliance: At the vanguard is Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and the man he hopes to unseat, President Donald Trump.

""My visit here is an indicator of the fact that we are working very hard on the First Step Act to comply with both the law and what we think Congress and the people who sponsored the bill intended,"" Rosen said in an interview with USA TODAY following a two-hour walking tour of the Englewood campus. ""We're pushing it hard; I'm putting my personal attention on that. The attorney general is, too.""

More than 1,000 freed so far

The vast federal prison system has long been a drag on the government, soaking up more than a quarter of the Justice Department's $28 billion budget.

Even though its prison population has dropped since 2014, with 180,664 inmates, it is still the largest penal system in the United States. The system holds more than seven times as many inmates as it did in 1980, at the start of the nation's drug war and a ""tough-on-crime"" strategy that featured mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat drug offenses that doomed some inmates to more than two decades behind bars. More than 45% of federal inmates are now serving terms for some type of drug offense, by far the largest offense grouping in the system.

The First Step Act, signed into law by Trump last year, is an attempt to both chip away at the spiraling incarceration costs and better prepare offenders for release by driving down rates of recidivism.

The law gave judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent drug offenders, and eases some of the long mandatory-minimum sentences for convicts with only minor criminal records. It allows the government to more easily release seriously ill inmates and seeks to reconcile extreme sentencing disparities between people who sell crack compared to powdered cocaine. That provision alone has already freed 1,093 inmates and led to shorter sentences for 1,540 others.

Longtime advocates for such criminal justice reforms, who also have often been the fiercest critics of the Justice Department, are encouraged by the recent action but are wary of the challenges confronting full implementation of the law.

""I think they are doing their best to get prepared,"" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which has long highlighted the impact of harsh sentencing policy on families of the incarcerated. ""The real test will be in the implementation of all of the different pieces.""

Ring said more attention and money will be needed to support job training and drug treatment programs. He said his group remains disappointed that several classes of offenders will be excluded from qualifying for increased credits for good behavior that can be earned by participating in rehabilitation programs. Those groups include: inmates convicted of terrorism, human trafficking, sex crimes, weapons-related offenses, some fraud crimes and drug traffickers.

""There is going to be some frustration,"" Ring said, referring to the excluded classes of inmates.

Hugh Hurwtiz, acting director of the federal prison system, also acknowledged that the exclusions represent a looming inmate management test for prison staffers.

""How do you manage inmates who are getting the credits and those who are not? That will be a challenge as we roll this out,"" Hurwitz said.

The roll out also comes at a time when the prison system is grappling with persistent staffing shortages. To make up for a shortage of guards, officials have ordered teachers, nurses, kitchen workers and other staffers to serve as correctional officers.

The practice, known as augmentation, has drawn staff away from rehabilitation programs that officials are now touting. It also has prompted criticism from some members of Congress who regard the practice as potentially dangerous.

Rosen, the deputy attorney general, said provisions of the new law ""will put additional demands"" on prison staffers and he indicated that Justice was reviewing staffing across the BOP. But he believed that current personnel levels were not jeopardizing safety.

""Everyone who is trained to work at a federal prison learns to participate in the security role,"" he said. ""But we're looking at that and plan to do whatever makes sense.""

'I plan to start my own company'

Dressed in a neatly pressed prison uniform, Littlelee Ragsdale looked the part of an inmate eager to turn the page on a troubled life.

Ragsdale, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, did not hesitate last week when called on to address Englewood's special guest – the deputy attorney general of the United States – to describe how his experience on the prison's roofing and road paving crew could change his life when his sentence is complete in 2023.

""I have a wife and three girls,"" Ragsdale began, adding that his work as a heavy equipment operator had prepared him to assume a new role of responsibility for a waiting family. ""I plan to start my own company.""

Even with the help of Englewood's program, Ragsdale's path will not be easy.

Ragsdale's brush with law enforcement authorities in 2016 was not a one-time mistake.

The former oil field worker has a criminal record that dates to 2001, including burglary and car theft, according to a Wyoming prosecutor familiar with his current case. Past social media posts and photographs also appear to show a fascination with firearms, including an image in which he posed with array of hand guns and rifles.

""If you want re-integration to be successful, you need to think about re-integration at the point of intake in the prison system, not just at the end,"" said Jeff Mellow, a professor of criminal justice at New York's John Jay College.

""When they are ready to leave, you really want to make sure that the first 90 days go smoothly. If they keep hitting that wall in a search for housing or a job many will eventually give up. You only have to think about people who make New Year's resolutions. How long do they last? To be successful post-release, it's so important to have all the resources in place.""

State Dept. Intelligence Analyst Quits to Protest Blocked House Testimony,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/climate/rod-schoonover-resigns.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — A State Department intelligence analyst has resigned in protest after the White House blocked his discussion of climate science in Congressional testimony, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Rod Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, testified last month before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the effects of climate change on national security. But, in a highly unusual move, the White House refused to approve Dr. Schoonover’s written testimony for entry into the permanent Congressional record.

The reasoning, according to a June 4 email reviewed by The New York Times, was that the science cited in Dr. Schoonover’s testimony did not correspond with White House views. Ultimately, Dr. Schoonover did deliver the oral testimony before the committee, but his accompanying written statement was not included in the official record of the hearing.

Dr. Schoonover did not respond to text message requesting comment. A policy expert familiar with his case confirmed that his resignation came as a direct result of the episode. His last day is expected to be Friday."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Thursday marks one year since a divided Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski to lead the Justice Department's criminal division.

The 51-48 vote reflected Democrats' worry that he'd try to interfere with the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Things didn't work out that way.

Benczkowski promised to consult with career officials about any possible conflicts with the special counsel probe, but he said this week that never became necessary.

""I've kept the promises that I made,"" Benczkowski said. ""I didn't have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. Nothing came across my desk. There was nothing that I had to deal with.""

Instead, Benczkowski has spent the past year advancing the administration's priorities: punishing transnational gangs; cracking down on corrupt doctors and pharmacists who fuel the opioid crisis in Appalachia and beyond; and making the process of investigating companies and business executives more transparent.

United States v. Guzman

It started with what Benczkowski said could be the biggest criminal trial in U.S. history: the effort to bring to justice former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

That trial extended nearly three months and coincided with a federal government shutdown, bringing uncertainty to DOJ lawyers about whether their hotel bills would ever be paid.

In the end, prosecutors from the criminal division at Justice worked with their counterparts in U.S. attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Miami to secure conviction of Guzman on all 10 of the drug and conspiracy charges.

Authorities recently asked for forfeiture in the amount of $12,666,181,704. Guzman faces mandatory life imprisonment when he is sentenced in New York City on July 17.

Benczkowski said he plans to be in court to support the team.

DOJ's opioid strike force

Benczkowski expressed concern early in his tenure that DOJ wasn't targeting the region that was hardest hit by the opioid crisis. So the criminal division put together a strike force that spans 10 areas in Appalachia.

He secured approval and funding to send 14 health care fraud prosecutors into the region, culminating in dozens of indictments of doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals last April.

That team continues to crunch data from health care providers and insurance programs to help uncover fraud. Benczkowski said he anticipates another round of prosecutions in Appalachia before the end of the year.

""We're going to keep going at it until we drive down the addiction rate and we drive down the overdose rate in those districts,"" he said.

The white-collar cases

Benczkowski said his third priority is bringing more ""transparency"" to white-collar crime investigations.

So the Justice Department issued new guidelines for prosecutors about recommending independent monitors to oversee errant corporations. Benczkowski also revamped the way that prosecutors assess whether a company is complying with the Justice Department.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Now, DOJ publishes online the times it declines to bring charges against companies that have behaved appropriately and deserved credit for that.

That sends a message, he said, and it makes his own prosecutors work ""a little bit harder."" Lawyers defending companies can point to those decisions and fashion arguments for their own leniency.

""Certainly it's going to give outside lawyers a little bit more ammunition to advocate with,"" he said, arguing that transparency will make government decisions more just.

Benczkowski's comment may prove controversial with consumer protection and shareholder advocates, as well as critics who argue the Justice Department has abandoned its responsibility to police corporate misconduct.

But the Justice Department said it has charged 211 people with fraud so far this year, about half of whom have pleaded guilty, an increase from last year in the same period. Benczkowski also said financial recoveries from corporate resolutions this year will be ""well north"" of $2 billion, about double the amount in 2018.

Benczkowski said he expects to pick a new chief of the DOJ fraud section, which prosecutes such offenses, by the end of the month.

Robert Zink has been filling the job in an acting role since January and may be in line to get the job on a permanent basis, two sources told NPR.

The ransomware menace

Prosecutors are also in the middle of responding to a wave of ransomware attacks that have victimized small and midsize cities in Florida, Georgia, Maryland and elsewhere.

Benczkowski said criminal groups are becoming sophisticated in how they identify their targets: municipalities big enough to afford to pay ransom, but not so sophisticated they're prepared for these kinds of threats.

Benczkowski said he has a message for those cities:

""Invest in the basic cybersecurity protections for your systems that you need, have redundant offline systems that you can turn to in the event that you're attacked, come to law enforcement early in the process ... so that we can help you get better prepared."""

Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China,https://www.npr.org,['Sasha Ingber'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740412768/ex-state-department-worker-gets-40-months-in-prison-for-secret-dealings-with-chi,"Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China

Enlarge this image toggle caption Luis M. Alvarez/AP Luis M. Alvarez/AP

A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for concealing her interactions with two Chinese intelligence agents, along with the extravagant gifts they gave her in exchange for government information.

Candace Claiborne began to work as an office management specialist at the State Department in 1999, according to court documents. She had a top secret security clearance and served overseas in such cities as Baghdad, Beijing and Shanghai.

But she ignored her responsibility to report foreign contacts, prosecutors said as they announced her sentence on Tuesday.

""Claiborne was entrusted with privileged information as a U.S. government employee, and she abused that trust at the expense of our nation's security,"" Acting Assistant Director John Selleck of the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a statement. ""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face,"" he added.

Over the course of five years, Chinese agents allegedly gave Claiborne and her family ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in gifts and perks – including wired cash, a monthly stipend, overseas trips, tuition at a Chinese fashion school and an apartment that was fully furnished. In exchange for the gifts, Claiborne gave them a window into the State Department's inner workings through copies of internal documents about dignitary visits and other topics.

Prosecutors said she told a co-conspirator that the agents were ""spies"" and wrote in her journal that she could ""Generate 20k in 1 year"" by working with one of the agents.

Federal public defender David Walker Bos, Claiborne's attorney, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Her arrest came in March 2017 after a sting operation in January of that year. An FBI agent, posing as a Chinese agent, approached Claiborne on a street in Washington, D.C. She welcomed him to her home and their lengthy discussion ended with the undercover agent thanking her for helping the ""Ministry,"" NPR previously reported.

After the arrest, she pleaded not guilty to charges of obstruction and making false statements to the FBI. In April 2019, she pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges.

A judge ordered Claiborne detained pending sentencing, but she requested to self-surrender on June 5, the document stated.

In addition to a 40-month prison sentence, Claiborne received three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

Her sentence comes after former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty this spring to spying for China – and as U.S. officials have warned that Chinese espionage is the country's most serious security threat."

Tuesday, a federal judge in New York blocked the move to swap legal teams by the Justice Department calling their reasoning ""deficient.""

DOE may have mistakenly shipped dangerous nuclear materials to Nevada,https://www.reviewjournal.com,"['Las Vegas Review-Journal', 'The Associated Press']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/doe-may-have-mistakenly-shipped-dangerous-nuclear-materials-to-nevada-1707928/,"The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled into Nevada.

The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled as low-level radioactive waste into Nevada in dozens of shipments over the past six years.

The shipments started in 2013 and stopped in December 2018. They were supposed to send only low-level radioactive waste from the department’s Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to the Nevada National Security Site, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, for secure disposal.

But on July 3, the Energy Department informed Nevada officials, that reactive material — which might be unstable under normal conditions and may have violent reactions when combined with other substances — may have been included in those shipments.

Gov. Steve Sisolak, as well as Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, sent Energy Secretary Rick Perry a letter two days later spelling out their concerns. They also expressed frustration over the latest error, which comes on the heels of the department’s decision last year to ship a half-metric ton of weapons grade plutonium to the security site and not disclose it until months after the fact.

‘Egregious acts’

“These egregious acts — whether acts of negligence or indicative of something else — are unconscionable and have potentially put the health and safety of Nevadans and our environment at unacceptable risk,” the letter said.

A Department of Energy spokesperson said there were nine shipments during that time frame that included 32 total containers of waste. Earlier in the day state officials had said that they were originally told there were 32 total shipments, and that the revised numbers released by the Energy Department were “significantly different than the info provided during DOE’s briefing to Governor Sisolak.”

The Energy Department confirmed Wednesday that shipments sent to the security site were not in compliance with its waste acceptance criteria, but said they posed no safety or health risk.

“The components that were shipped pose no risk to the safety and health of the general public or workers at the facility at NNSS. The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” the department said in a statement.

The DOE also said that planned future shipments from the Tennessee facility have been “temporarily suspended,” and that Perry has directed staff to initiate a department-wide assessment of all shipping policies and procedures.

Nevada’s congressional delegation condemned both the Energy Department and Perry Wednesday for the errors, with Rep. Dina Titus calling the shipments “a new low.”

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Titus said in a statement.

Rep. Steven Horsford went so far as to call for Perry to resign from his post.

“Secretary Perry has repeatedly disrespected the people of Nevada and eroded the public trust in his ability to abide by established rules for waste disposal. His failure to disclose these actions amount to their lying to a federal judge, our Nevada congressional delegation and our state’s governor repeatedly about his agency’s activities in our state. Secretary Perry must resign immediately,” Horsford said in a statement.

Cortez Masto and Rosen, in a joint statement, said they would work to hold the government accountable for the shipments.

“Yet again, the DOE has violated its mission, broken Nevadans’ trust and failed to follow its own compliance procedures,” the statement reads. “We intend to immediately determine whether the mixed waste shipped to Nevada poses a hazard to the health and safety of Nevadans and will take every action necessary to hold the DOE accountable.”

And Rep. Susie Lee weighed in as well. “The continued carelessness with our safety is exactly the concern of every Nevadan who is told that we should welcome the storage of nuclear waste in our own backyard,” she said. “It’s clear that the Department of Energy does not take Americans’ health, safety, or security into consideration before making decisions. On behalf of every Nevadan, I am demanding answers from the DOE about how this could possibly happen and demanding the swift removal of this material from our state.”

Top officials briefed

On Tuesday, the governor and members of his senior staff met with top federal officials, including National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, for a pair of in-person briefings at the Energy Department’s North Las Vegas offices. One briefing was unclassified, while a subsequent classified meeting followed that only Sisolak and top Nevada Department of Environmental Protection officials were privy to.

Sisolak learned of the error in a phone call with Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who told the governor that the shipments had been incorrectly labeled and “may contain a reactive material,” according to the letter sent last week.

“Such waste has never been approved for disposal at the NNSS,” the letter said.

The security site has operated as a permanent disposal location for what the federal government classifies as low-level nuclear waste, which can include rags, clothing, construction debris, filters and other equipment contaminated through exposure to radioactive material.

The governor’s office said that the Energy Department has not yet confirmed that the shipments contained any reactive materials, which Sisolak’s office said “would trigger additional safety concerns and run afoul of existing state permits and federal statutes governing the waste disposal mission at NNSS.”

The site also takes in some “mixed low-level” waste, which contains both low-level waste and hazardous waste materials — things like garbage, sludge and other discarded solid waste materials — so long as the reactive material has been neutralized. The NNSS does not accept mixed waste with any sludge, liquids or pressurized vessels, according to the DOE spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the canisters shipped from Tennessee contained what the department refers to as “squibs,” — small, pressurized devices designed to remotely cut wires — which violates the NNSS’ waste acceptance agreement.

Intended for separate facility

Because it includes hazardous material, the mixed-waste is supposed to be handled separately at a dedicated facility at the security site where it is processed. The mixed-level waste is buried in lined trenches as a precaution, whereas low-level waste is buried in unlined trenches.

But the shipments sent between 2013 and 2018 were not properly categorized, which means the the federal government does not know which were low-level waste and which possibly contained dangerous hazardous materials.

Beyond violating the site’s own waste acceptance criteria agreement, not knowing the type of waste that is being stored at the security site could be dangerous for the site’s estimated 3,000 employees as well as the surrounding ecosystem. Materials are classified as hazardous because they are “known to be harmful to human health and the environment when not managed properly, regardless of their concentrations,” according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.

Progressive advocacy groups, including Credo Action, MoveOn, UltraViolet and the American Federation of Teachers, projected the words “Acosta Enabled Sex Trafficking” and “Acosta Must Go” on the building.

“Secretary Acosta’s actions in not disclosing the plea deal of a politically well-connected predator to the victims of that predator were illegal and unconscionable.

DHS Admits It Doesn't Have to Reject Donations to Migrants,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Sam Brodey', 'Congressional Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-admits-it-doesnt-have-to-reject-donations-to-migrants,"Americans have responded to reports of abysmal conditions at federally-run government migrant detention centers—where many, including children, lack access to basic necessities—by sending them donations of supplies like soap, toothbrushes, diapers, and toys.

So far, those donations have been rejected by the Department of Homeland Security, leaving the public and lawmakers alike angry and scratching their heads as to why. But the agency, which runs many of these detention centers, is now acknowledging that there is little legal basis to justify turning down donations from the public to help improve conditions for migrants.

Former DHS officials have contended in the press that it would be against the law for the government to accept donations of supplies for migrants provided by private citizens due to an obscure law called the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from using anything that has not been paid for through funds appropriated by Congress.

Unless, of course, the agency is DHS, which could take advantage of a massive loophole provided for them to do just that in existing law.

An appropriations bill signed into law in 2004 authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to “accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts and bequests… to facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland Security.” There is also an exception for emergencies involving “the safety of human life.”

In response to questions from The Daily Beast, a DHS spokesperson did not say whether or not the Antideficiency Act prohibits the agency from accepting donated supplies for the benefit of migrants currently held in detention.

“CBP must comply with Federal law and relevant DHS policy in order to receive and manage donations,” said the spokesperson, referencing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that directly manages detention facilities. “At this time we are coordinating among relevant CBP offices, including our Office of Chief Counsel to determine how we can most efficiently accept and manage donations from the public, in compliance with law and policy.”

A House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that DHS could easily apply this 2004 statute to the current situation, putting the agency on solid legal ground to accept the boxes of hygiene supplies and toys that charities and private citizens have been ferrying to overcrowded, needy facilities in places like Clint, Texas. “The bigger issue, they’ve told us, isn’t the legal issue here, it’s more the logistical issue,” the aide said.

A House Republican aide echoed concerns about logistics and the capacity of the agency, which just obtained an emergency infusion of $4.6 billion from Congress to handle the situation at the border.

“Processing donations takes manpower,” said the aide. “Employees have to inspect donations, launder clothes, etc., at a time when CBP is already stretched thin.” DHS would not comment on its communications with lawmakers.

To this point, lawmakers from both parties and both sides of the Capitol have pressed the department for an explanation of why donations from the public are going unused. “This is something we need to address in hours and days, not weeks and months,” read a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, sent on June 3 by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and signed by 13 GOP lawmakers and three Democrats.

That group asked DHS to tell them how they could provide resources to help them better process donations. But a spokesperson for Crenshaw said on Monday that they had not yet received a response to their inquiries.

In another letter to McAleenan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also urged DHS to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

In June, a DHS official told reporters that they might use donations — but argued they weren’t necessary. “We are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward,” said the official, according to CNN. “But those items, it's important to note, are available now.""

“I think they don’t want to create the idea they’re not capable of taking care of this on their own,” said the House Democratic aide."
The Energy 202: Agriculture Department pushes back against reports it’s trying to curb climate-related science,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'July At Am']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/07/11/the-energy-202-agriculture-department-pushes-back-against-reports-it-s-trying-to-curb-climate-related-science/5d266522a7a0a47d87c570c1/,"THE LIGHTBULB

The Agriculture Department’s research leaders appear to be doing damage control after reports that the agency suppressed climate science research and potentially violated its own scientific integrity policies.

The pushback comes after a Politico investigation found the USDA attempted to keep innovative government-funded climate change research from the public eye. And The Washington Post revealed earlier this year the agency required its in-house scientists to label their peer-reviewed studies as “preliminary” — a policy it reversed in May after criticism that such a disclaimer would diminish the impact of the work or prevent its publication.

In an internal letter sent to all research employees on Friday, USDA scientific directors and administrators argued that the department did not undermine climate research — and had not violated its scientific integrity policy.

“USDA has no policy, practice, nor intent to minimize, discredit, de-emphasize or otherwise influence the climate-related science carried out by USDA scientists and agencies,” read the letter signed by deputy undersecretary Scott Hutchins and several top research officials, including acting chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young. Three USDA employees separately confirmed the letter’s authenticity to The Post.

USDA research contributed to more than 500 articles “related to climate science projects” published in scientific journals in 2018, the letter continued.

“Scientific integrity is of paramount importance in USDA, and the USDA scientific integrity policy specifically states that ‘scientific findings and products must not be suppressed or altered for political purposes and must not be subjected to inappropriate influence.’ ”

The USDA did not offer further comment on the letter. “The email sent to REE employees last week is self-explanatory,” USDA spokesman Damon Thompson said in an email to The Post, referring to the agency’s research, education and economics division.

But Politico uncovered that the USDA withheld a news release about a study that found rice loses nutrients when environmental carbon increases.

The communications office also pressured the University of Washington, whose scientists were co-authors of the report, not to publicize the report. “The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann told Politico.

“When this has to be said, it confirms what we all know,” said a senior employee at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, of the letter. “If this were true, scientists wouldn’t have had to publish their papers as ‘preliminary data.’ Instead, two USDA science agencies are being exiled to Kansas City.”

The employee was referring to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue’s announcement in June that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds more than a billion dollars each year in agriculture research, and the Economic Research Service, an influential statistical agency, would move out of their Washington offices to Kansas City by the end of September. The decision prompted concerns among current and former USDA employees that the Trump administration was seeking to suppress research through employee attrition and physically moving them far from collaborators.

An analysis by the firm Ernst & Young suggests the move will save $300 million over 15 years. But the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, a professional association for economists, has disputed those savings, arguing the move may cost taxpayers up to $128 million because the initial analysis does not account for the value of lost research data and overstates the cost of keeping the agencies in the capital.

Employees, worried about uprooted families and hampered careers — the agencies frequently collaborate with other Washington-based employees — have quit in unusually large numbers. A recent survey conducted by the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents the two agencies, suggests about seven in 10 employees do not plan to relocate to Kansas City.

“Our staff, with all their years of experience, are leaving for other agencies. We should be focused on this, rather than hastily moving the agency,” Wesley Dean, a NIFA employee and vice president of the local bargaining unit, said in a statement on Wednesday.

— State Dept. official who was barred from submitting climate testimony steps down: Rod Schoonover, the State Department intelligence aide who the White House blocked from submitting written testimony on climate change, is resigning from the agency. Schoonover is leaving voluntarily, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports, adding that still, “the incident that led to his departure underscores the extent to which climate science has become contested terrain under the current administration.” The State Department confirmed he will leave his post Friday. The outgoing aide “spoke before the House Intelligence Committee on June 5 about the security risks the United States faces because of climate change. But White House officials would not let him submit the bureau’s written statement that climate impacts could be ‘possibly catastrophic,’ after the State Department refused to cut references to federal scientific findings on climate change.”

CHair @RepRaulGrijalva is calling for Gov. Rossello of Puerto Rico to step down given multiple arrests in a corruption probe. The @washingtonpost story is accurate, despite some confusion. https://t.co/sVAwGRGlvs — Natural Resources Committee (@NRDems) July 10, 2019

— Arrests in Puerto Rico scandal spur concerns about storm aid: The FBI arrested two former top officials who served in the administration of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, an incident that pushed Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who leads the House panel that oversees the U.S. territory, to call for Rosselló to resign. “The federal indictment says the former officials illegally directed federal funding to politically connected contractors. The arrests come about a month after Congress approved a controversial disaster aid bill that earmarked additional funding for Puerto Rico’s recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was tied up in part because President Trump called Puerto Rico’s officials 'incompetent or corrupt,'"" The Post’s Jeff Stein reports. He adds ""island’s allies fear the arrests will give Trump greater justification for curtailing badly needed aid to the island.""

— The latest in tensions between Iran and Western powers: Britain says it stopped three Iranian vessels from interfering with one of its tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. In a statement the British government said it was “concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.” “Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps denied Thursday that it was involved in challenging the British tanker, which is operated by the London-based oil and gas company BP, saying in a statement carried by Iranian news outlets that there had been no confrontations with foreign vessels in the past 24 hours,” The Post’s Erin Cunningham reports.

— U.S. accuses Iran of ‘nuclear extortion’: In a statement made during an emergency meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the United States accused Iran of “nuclear extortion” and said its latest efforts to increase atomic energy activities would “exacerbate” tensions between the United States and Tehran, Cunningham reports. “There is no credible reason for Iran to expand its nuclear program, and there is no way to read this as anything other than a crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community,” the United States said at the meeting. President Trump also threatened Iran with more sanctions in a Wednesday tweet and without evidence charged that Iran has “long been secretly ‘enriching’” uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal.

""No one should take this storm lightly"": The National Hurricane Center is predicting that the season's first hurricane, Barry, will hit the coast of Louisiana on Saturday. “The storm is predicted to be a massive rainmaker, unloading double-digit rainfall totals that will probably trigger serious inland flooding. Assuming it attains hurricane strength, damaging wind gusts are likely near where it comes ashore as well as a dangerous storm surge, which is a rise in water above normally dry land that can inundate homes, roads and businesses,"" The Post's Brian McNoldy and Jason Samenow report. ""Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, warning residents that '[t]his is going to be a Louisiana event with coastal flooding and heavy rainfall potentially impacting every part of the state.

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California’s largest utility was aware for years that hundreds of miles of its power lines could spark wildfires, but according to documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal, PG&E did not act to solve the problem. “The failure last year of a century-old transmission line that sparked a wildfire, killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise wasn’t an aberration, the documents show,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “A year earlier, PG&E executives conceded to a state lawyer that the company needed to process many projects, all at once, to prevent system failures — a problem they said could be likened to a ‘pig in the python.’”

A judge responds: The federal judge overseeing PG&E’s probation related to its safety-related violations is ordering PG&E to response to the Wall Street Journal’s report “on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis.” William Alsup, a U.S. district court judge in Northern California gave the company until the end of the month to submit a “fresh, forthright statement owning up to the true extent of the” report, according to the Journal.

Justice Department trying to quash Mueller team testimony,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Morgan', 'Min Read']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/justice-department-trying-to-quash-mueller-team-testimony-report-idUSKCN1U51JJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is trying to prevent two former members of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team from testifying behind closed doors in Congress next week, when Mueller will testify before lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller makes a statement on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the Justice Department in Washington, U.S., May 29, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo

The department is opposing testimony by Aaron Zebley and James Quarles before the Democratic-led Judiciary and Intelligence committees in the House of Representatives, two sources said.

The men were expected to testify on July 17, the same day that Mueller is due as a witness before the two panels.

Democrats said they still expect Zebley and Quarles to appear, arguing that the Justice Department has no authority over the behavior of former employees. But a third source told Reuters that the former Mueller team members were still negotiating with the committees.

“We expect them to appear,” Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters. “We’ve got two hours with the Judiciary and Mr. Mueller, and two hours for the Intel committee with Mr. Mueller, and then some time afterwards with his staff.”

Justice Department officials had no immediate comment and Zebley and Quarles could not be reached for comment.

The episode is the latest example of Trump administration efforts to stymie congressional investigations by directing current and former officials not to cooperate with investigators who are seeking evidence of corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power in the Trump presidency.

Democrats plan to attack the administration’s blocking tactics this month with a federal lawsuit. In preparation for court action, the committee on Wednesday told the White House in a letter that it rejected immunity claims that prompted one former Trump aide to refuse to answer more than 200 questions.

The panel gave White House officials until July 17 to produce a revised list of objections.

House Judiciary Committee Democrats, who are poised to expand their probe of Trump, his family and associates with a slew of new subpoenas, say Mueller’s testimony will focus public attention on some of the more disturbing findings of his two-year investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

In a 448-page report, Mueller said the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Moscow, though the investigation did not find sufficient evidence to show conspiracy.

He did not conclude that Trump obstructed justice by trying to impede the Russia probe, but also did not exonerate the president of doing so.

The House Judiciary Committee is also investigating alleged hush payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, including porn star Stormy Daniels.

“The Dems Witch Hunt continues!” Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday. He has regularly denounced the Mueller investigation while also claiming that the probe found “no collusion” with Russia and “no obstruction.”

Judiciary Committee Democrats privately met on Wednesday to discuss details of conducting the Mueller hearing and his aides’ testimony. Lawmakers emerging from the session said arrangement were still in flux.

Mueller, in his first public comments since starting his investigation, said on May 29 that Justice Department policies meant the probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump, and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said."
Trump Admin’s ‘Pro-Women’ Human Rights Panel Stacked With Anti-Abortion Figures,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Emily Shugerman', 'Gender Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-loads-pro-women-commission-on-unalienable-rights-with-abortion-opponents,"A new Trump administration commission on human rights will be filled with anti-abortion advocates, including a former ambassador to the Holy See who declared that abortion is “related to the coarsening of the social fabric.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights last week in a Wall St. Journal op-ed, in which he claimed the discussion around human rights had become diluted. The new group, he wrote, would “ground our discussion of human rights in America’s founding principles.”

The announcement drew concern from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who worried the commission would seek to limit the scope of human rights domestically and abroad. And while the State Department claims the group will not discuss abortion, the conservative makeup of the commission has reproductive rights advocates on edge.

“Appointing these ideologues to a commission purporting to safeguard human rights will have the opposite effect and will endanger the health and well-being of countless women,” Michelle Kuppersmith, director of reproductive rights group Equity Forward, said in a statement.

“This is a clear extension of the Trump administration’s anti-women, anti-reproductive health campaign, and a blatant attempt to restrict the rights of vulnerable populations around the globe.”

The chair of the 12-person commission, Harvard Professor Mary Ann Glendon, is a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See who led the Vatican’s delegation to the United Nations Conference on Women in 1995. At the time, she told The New York Times she “could not agree more” with Pope John Paul II, who was known for his traditional Catholic stances on abortion and contraception. She later went on to receive Notre Dame’s Evangelium Vitae Medal for “Heroes Of The Pro-Life Movement.”

‘The whole question about abortion is related to the coarsening of the social fabric,” Glendon told the Times in 1995. “It promotes a certain callousness which has frightening implications for the future.”

Also serving on the commission is F. Cartwright Weiland, a Texas-based attorney who studied under Glendon at Harvard Law. Weiland helped write Supreme Court amicus briefs supporting Texas’s restrictions on abortion providers and served on the Council For Life’s “Role of Rights” education panel.

Commission member Shaykh Hamza Yusuf Hanson, the president of Zaytuna College, published an article last year calling abortion “an assault on a sanctified life,” while fellow member Christopher Olaf Tollefsen co-authored the book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, which argues against stem-cell research and promotes the idea that life begins at conception.

“There is nothing potential about the life of the fetus, the embryo, or the zygote: it is actually alive,” he wrote in a 2010 journal article. “Nor is there anything potential about the humanity of that life: it is an actual human life.”

Commission member Jacqueline Rivers, a sociology lecturer at Harvard, spoke on a 2017 Harvard Law Students For Life Panel Entitled “Why We Are ProLife: Dignity, Equality, Human Rights,” where she discussed how her pro-life views are rooted in her Christian faith. (The year before, she had delivered a letter to Hillary Clinton from more than 20 black church leaders asking her to address “justice for the unborn.”) In 2016, commission member Paolo Carozza spoke about a pro-life approach to international develeopment on the Notre Dame Right To Life Panel.

A senior administration official did not answer The Daily Beast’s questions about whether any members of the commission support abortion rights. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the commission would be advisory in nature and would not address “policy questions” like abortion rights. Instead, the official said, it would attempt to ground human rights in the founding principles of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

“This is really a commission devoted to principles of inalienable rights,” the official said. “The commission has nothing to do with those kinds of domestic policy debates of the day; it will not discuss them.”

“ The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women. ” — Senior administration official

“The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women,” the official added.

The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to reduce its commitment to reproductive rights internationally, pushing to remove references to “sexual and reproductive health” from U.N. documents and threatening to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on rape as a weapon of war because it mentioned reproductive health services. The State Department has also removed all data on reproductive rights from its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

In a press release, the Center for Reproductive Rights called the new commission “part of a comprehensive effort by this Administration to erase sexual and reproductive health and rights from global discourse.”

“Contrary to its asserted purpose, there is no need to redefine or develop foundational principles on human rights,” they said. “There is a clear and unequivocal consensus by U.N. human rights treaty bodies and independent experts that reproductive rights are human rights, grounded in the right to life, health, equality, non-discrimination and freedom from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, among other rights.”

Amanda Kasling, the Human Rights Watch Acting Co-Director for Women’s Rights, added that interpretations of international law define abortion is a human rights issue. Even a limited discussion of of “inalienable rights,” she said, would have include access to health care—including access to family planning and abortion—as well as prevention of maternal mortality.

“For women to actually be able to fully enjoy and have a fulfillment of their human rights, you have to ensure access to reproductive health care, full stop,” she said."

Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell goods to Huawei where there is no threat to national security.

US Suspends Low-Level Radioactive Waste Shipments to Nevada,https://time.com,['Scott Sonner'],,,,https://time.com/5624166/nevada-radioactive-waste-shipments-rick-perry/,"(RENO, Nev.) — A Nevada congressman called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years.

The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals.

Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a department-wide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.

Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said none of the materials shipped to Nevada as early as 2013 from the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public.

But she acknowledged the shipments slated for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site were not in compliance with the site’s acceptance criteria.

The department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation “to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” Hynes said in a statement on Wednesday.

The low-level waste material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same Nevada site last year from South Carolina and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

But Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada, said in calling for Perry to “resign immediately” that the new disclosure is further evidence that Nevada has been covertly “coerced” into illegally receiving nuclear materials “through negligence or outright trickery.”

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other members of Nevada’s congressional delegation stopped short of demanding Perry resign but were equally critical of his department’s handling of the waste.

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, said.

Sisolak said Brouillette telephoned him on July 3 to inform him that the department “has been shipping incorrectly labeled low-level waste” from Tennessee to Nevada.

Sisolak also released a letter he and Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen sent to Perry on July 5 expressing their concerns and demanding more details.

The Democratic governor said he was more fully briefed on the situation during both classified and unclassified meetings in Las Vegas on Tuesday with senior department officials, including Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, head of DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration.

Sisolak said he originally was told the waste shipped out of compliance with the department’s criteria governing low-level waste disposal at the Nevada site included 32 total shipments that began in 2013 and ended last December. But his office clarified there were six shipments that included a total of 32 canisters.

Sisolak said the department hasn’t determined yet whether the material labeled as low-level waste may have included mixed low-level waste, which is regulated more stringently under state and federal guidelines and requires treatment prior to disposal.

For example, Sisolak said the Energy Department entered into a settlement agreement with the state in May after DOE was cited for accepting low-level radioactive waste at the Nevada site that was subsequently found to be contaminated with chromium at a toxicity level higher than is allowed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — “thereby rendering it a mixed, low-level radioactive waste.”

Hynes said Wednesday the department leadership first was notified on July 3 that certain shipments of waste managed by a contractor at the Y-12 facility failed to comply with the Nevada site’s criteria, and may have been “mischaracterized” as low-level waste.

“The components that were shipped have been disposed of in a safe and secure manner at the NNSS, and as a precaution, planned future shipments of components from Y-12 have been temporarily suspended,” she said.

"Border apprehensions decline 28 percent following US-Mexico partnership, DHS says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Deputy Commissioner For U.S. Customs', 'Border Protection Robert Perez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-apprehensions-decline-dramatically-following-us-mexico-partnership,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that apprehensions at the southwest border plummeted in June after the Mexican government agreed early in the month -- under the threat of punishing U.S. tariffs -- to dramatically step up its own immigration enforcement efforts.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data showed a 28 percent drop in apprehensions from May, when 144,278 individuals were detained. Although some analysts blamed the ""summer heat"" for part of the new decline, the Trump administration noted in a statement that the decline in apprehensions ""outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent"" in the same period.

The numbers refer to would-be immigrants caught trying to illegally cross the border, and not migrants who approach ports of entry.

The reduction in apprehensions ""accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala,"" DHS said in a statement.

""Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care,"" the statement continued.

Law enforcement and administration officials said President Trump's hard push for the deal with Mexico had made all the difference. Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday that morale among law enforcement at the border had increased.

BORDER PATROL DECLARES 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY,' AS FORMER DHS OFFICIAL SAYS 'DESPERATION' HAS SET IN

""I think it's a combination of a few things,"" Perez said. ""I think it certainly is an unprecedented agreement that we've made with Mexico, that the president was able to secure about a month ago. We are definitely seeing and are encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken.""

Some Republicans, however, were not pleaded with Mexico's efforts. Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter that it was ""unacceptable"" to see the fourth straight month of more than 100,000 border arrests, even though he praised the decrease in monthly apprehensions as a ""good"" sign.

""The President was right to demand more from Mexico,"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Now some actions from Congress would be nice.""

Earlier in June, Mexico committed to deploy thousands of National Guard troops throughout Mexico, including at its northern and southern land borders, as well as to increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico just prior to that breakthrough, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% [sic] level ...!""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% [sic] Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump warned on May 30. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Shortly after Trump's threat but before the deal was reached, Mexico's financial intelligence agency announced it had frozen the bank accounts of 26 people who it claimed to ""have presumably participated in migrant smuggling and the organization of illegal migrant caravans.""

MEXICO USING X-RAY TECHNOLOGY TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

The agency said it had detected money transfers from central Mexico to six Mexican border cities presumably related to the caravans.

And some 200 Mexican military police, immigration agents and federal police blocked the advance of about 1,000 Central American migrants who were walking north along a highway in the southern part of the country.

""We are definitely seeing and are encouragd by the steps Mexico has taken."" — Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez

The group of migrants, including many women and children, set out early from Ciudad Hidalgo at the Mexico-Guatemala border and was headed for Tapachula, the principal city in the region. State and local police accompanied the caravan. The officials blocked the highway near the community of Metapa, about 11 miles from Tapachula.

And this week, it emerged that while the Mexican National Guard deploys to places like Tapachula on the country's southern border and makes changes to its asylum protocol, agents with the country's National Migration Institute (INM) are using a giant X-ray to find migrants being smuggled into the country in trucks.

Mexican officials said they caught more than 200 migrants hidden in trucks the last two days, using X-rays to see the people hidden inside.

The Mexican security ministry also said it found 228 migrants in a routine search of a soft drink transportation truck in one of its southern states on Monday.

Like many of her former Mueller team colleagues who have remained tight-lipped about their work for him, Ahmad declined to discuss her time in the two-year pressure cooker of the special counsel’s office.

“I think that Bob Mueller is an amazing public servant and he assembled a great team who worked incredibly hard, with the highest level of integrity,” she said. “That is something that I hope the American public knows.”

Mueller is scheduled to testify next week to Congress about his investigation — a much-anticipated public hearing that Democrats hope will refocus public attention on President Trump’s conduct.

[Mueller to testify to Congress about his investigation]

Ahmad said she had no particular hope or expectation for Mueller’s testimony, and declined to comment when asked if she had any interest in testifying about the investigation.

Ahmad brought to the special counsel experience negotiating with foreign governments to gather evidence and interview witnesses. And she looks to do similar work in private practice.

She said some of her “greatest thrills” as a prosecutor came in securing witnesses or arranging the extradition of foreign terrorist suspects to the United States.

“I really enjoy navigating the divide between countries and cultures and languages and backgrounds, and I hope to do a lot of international work,” she said.

In addition to the probe of Flynn, which led to his guilty plea for lying to the FBI, Ahmad worked on a prolonged subpoena fight with a still-unidentified company controlled by a foreign government. That battle went to the Supreme Court, and in January a judge imposed a $50,000-a-day fine on the firm for not complying with Mueller’s subpoena. Those penalties stopped the following month, when the company turned over nearly 1,000 pages of documents.

Ahmad declined to comment on the case.

She said she would be open to someday going back to work at the Justice Department but had no specific goal to do so.

Ahmad said she’s still adjusting to life after the Justice Department, and after working for Mueller, whose office was so secure it was designated a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. That meant that when prosecutors showed up for work, they had to check their cellphones at the door. Before joining Mueller’s team, Ahmad spent much of her time as a terrorism prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York inside similarly secure workspaces.

“I have gotten so used to not having my cellphone with me, that now I find it overwhelming to have it with me and be expected to respond to things in a timely manner,” she said. “I miss having the ‘SCIF excuse’ for poor communication.”"
"Kim Jong-un believes Trump is ""different,"" State Dept's intelligence arm assesses",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kim-jong-un-believes-trump-is-different-state-depts-intelligence-arm-assesses/,"It's likely that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continues to adhere to a deep-seated belief that the United States is seeking regime change in North Korea, but he is less convinced Washington will take military action and believes President Donald Trump is ""different,"" according to Ellen McCarthy, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR).

""I can't say whether or not [Kim] likes or dislikes [President Trump], we don't know that,"" McCarthy said. ""But we definitely [have] assessed that he does look at the president and thinks this one is different.""

As head of INR – the oldest all-source U.S. intelligence agency, and among the smallest, within the 17-member community – McCarthy leads a cadre of about 250 analysts at the State Department who provide assessments to the secretary of state, relevant policymakers and the president.

North Korea is an area where it's ""particularly hard"" to arrive at a fulsome intelligence assessment, McCarthy said. ""We're really relying on media analysis and other intelligence to get a sense of – in terms of Kim Jong-un – how he thinks of us.""

But she added, ""I would say that, based on our understanding of the media and things that he has said, he really does think that the U.S. is looking for regime change, and that he does not believe we'll take military action, and that – I think he thinks – we cheat on agreements, and that we're not necessarily to be trusted in that regard.""

In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, McCarthy, who assumed her current post in January after more than two decades spent in a variety of roles in the intelligence community and private sector, said the ""different relationship"" Kim and Trump have forged may have lessened Kim's suspicions about certain U.S. objectives.

""I think in general, when you look at all these world leaders, they all think that [regime change is] what we want, and frankly that has been a goal in many of our previous operations,"" McCarthy said. ""I don't know if that is as heavy on [Kim's] mind as it was in the past,"" she said.

Trump and Kim's most recent face-to-face meeting took place late last month in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, roughly 30 hours after president Trump first tweeted an offer to ""say Hello"" to Kim. Once they shared a handshake, and to Kim's apparent glee, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to, in about 20 paces, cross into North Korean territory.

While the three-hour visit generated worldwide headlines and wall-to-wall television coverage, it was unclear whether Trump's meeting yielded any more substantive progress in the nuclear talks, which have been stalled since the failed February summit in Hanoi.

And despite the consistently warm rhetoric exchanged by the two leaders, U.S. intelligence assessments about Kim's willingness to give up his nuclear weapons program remain unchanged. The 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment said the intelligence community ""continues to assess that [North Korea] is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities.""

""My sense is that that's still very much where our analysts lie,"" McCarthy said.

""But if all the intelligence is suggesting that this is what the intelligence says, we will give it to the policymaker,"" she continued. ""If they don't agree, they get to do that.""

""[A]n analyst is not losing a moment of sleep because of it, because it's our job to feed them the intelligence,"" McCarthy told Morell. ""It's their job to develop the policy.""

The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, said Monday that the U.S. government could run out of money in two months if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)

The U.S. government could run out of money to pay all of its bills by early September if Congress doesn’t rush to raise the debt ceiling, a think tank said Monday, a time frame that could force lawmakers to act much sooner than planned.

The Bipartisan Policy Center said that the Treasury Department could breach the borrowing limit in two months because the government has brought in far less tax revenue this year than was projected. The BPC uses economic models to forecast the government’s ability to pay its bills, and its estimates are often studied by the White House and congressional leaders.

In May, it had projected that Treasury would have until October or November before it ran into debt ceiling problems.

[Hiring rebounds in June, easing fears of a U.S. recession]

Congressional negotiations to raise the debt ceiling bogged down in recent weeks, with some leaders hoping to package a debt limit increase with a broader budget package. Those talks have faltered amid disagreements with the White House, and it is unclear when they plan to hold a vote.

But if lawmakers heed the BPC’s warning about the debt ceiling, they could be forced to raise the borrowing limit before a lengthy break in August. Senior GOP senators said Monday that the new projected timeline could increase pressure on Congress to act.

“That could change the dynamic,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). “We cannot default. That would send chaos through the financial markets.""

G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the BPC, said tax revenue, particularly money paid by corporations, has lagged far behind estimates and has provided Treasury much less cash than expected. When the government collects less money in taxes, it has less money to pay its bills. Typically, it would address this by borrowing more money, but its ability to do this is limited because Congress hasn’t raised the debt limit.

Even though there have been numerous political showdowns over the debt ceiling, Congress and the White House have never breached the limit. Financial experts have projected that failing to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a stock market crash and a spike in interest rates. The Treasury is expected to run a deficit of roughly $900 billion this year because spending far outpaces tax collection, and borrowing costs would also shoot higher.

BPC officials said it was difficult to pinpoint when exactly the Treasury would run out of money. While they said there was a “significant” chance the government would run out of funds in the first half of September, they said the more likely scenario is that it would have enough until sometime in October. If Treasury can make it through early September, it is expected to receive billions of dollars in tax payments that are due in late September, giving it a bit more flexibility. They said it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely when the debt ceiling would be breached because hundreds of billions of dollars come in and out of the government each month.

Still, Hoagland said, lawmakers “might want to seriously consider quicker action than waiting until early October.”

“We just want to raise the red flag to be very cautious and careful about what action they may want to take before too long,” he said.

[‘This doesn’t look like the best economy ever’: 40% of Americans say they still struggle to pay bills]

The government makes millions of payments each month, from Social Security benefits to interest payments on its debt. During a debt ceiling standoff with Congress, the Obama administration considered prioritizing payments to minimize the disruption for financial markets. But Democrats and Republicans have stressed that there is no way to contain the fallout from a debt ceiling breach given that U.S. debt is considered to be one of the safest investments.

BPC officials outlined twin risks if the debt ceiling isn’t increased. They said it could lead to a cessation of benefits for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly, but also a stock market crash that could hurt the investments of millions of Americans.

Congress is scheduled to go into recess for much of August and not return until after Labor Day weekend in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling for months, but his overtures have not been met with much enthusiasm by Democrats or Republicans. He has also told lawmakers that the debt ceiling could be breached in September.

The looming debt ceiling threat has caused growing concern on Capitol Hill, especially since it nearly coincides with a Sept. 30 deadline when the federal government will begin to shut down unless new spending legislation is passed. Lawmakers also want to avert onerous spending caps that threaten to slash $126 billion from domestic and military budgets early next year absent a deal.

But there are differences between Republicans and Democrats -- and between GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration -- over the best way to proceed. Trump administration officials recently proposed raising the debt ceiling while extending existing federal spending levels for a year, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called that approach “unacceptable” because the Pentagon wouldn’t get enough money. At the same time, Republicans have chafed at Democrats’ demands for higher domestic spending levels.

All that has left the path forward unclear even as lawmakers express increasing urgency as their annual August recess approaches.

“I think we need to hustle to a (budget) caps deal as soon as we possibly can and include the debt limit in it, no doubt,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Monday evening after emerging from a Senate GOP leadership meeting where the issues were discussed. “I don’t think it’s in anybody’s best interest to have that fight in September up against the deadline.”

In 2018, Congress suspended the debt ceiling until March 2019. Because that date has passed, Treasury has taken numerous steps to avoid defaulting on obligations by moving money around or delaying certain costs. But Treasury will eventually run out of ways to buy more time.

The U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through revenue, and it covers the difference by borrowing money. It borrows by issuing debt, but it can do so only up to a limit set by Congress."
Homeland Security: We've done all we could with limited resources for migrant children,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Karen Tandy', 'Jayson Ahern', 'Robert C. Bonner', 'James R. Jones', 'Opinion Contributors', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/10/migrant-children-homeland-security-done-all-reasonably-could-editorials-debates/1699263001/,"CLOSE

To fix this immigration problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding: Opposing view

Since last fall, the Department of Homeland Security has consistently stated that Border Patrol’s temporary holding spaces were not designed nor ever intended to detain the record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the border, including tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families every month.

During multiple border trips, our panel consistently observed alarming conditions at holding facilities despite Border Patrol’s valiant efforts to feed, clothe and improve medical care for migrants, many of whom arrived diseased or ill from the perilous journey.

With dangerous, illegal border crossings continuously rising, in April our bipartisan panel of the Homeland Security Advisory Council issued its public report urging emergency funding and legislative fixes to address this surge and the nation’s broken immigration system.

Our recommendations included establishing temporary regional centers near the southwest border and another in Guatemala with sufficient living space, judges, security and medical support to humanely care for families and children and timely process their claims. Today, our panel still awaits congressional action on our emergency recommendations from April 16.

The numbers are staggering. This fiscal year, more than 266,000 children illegally crossed our border primarily from Central America, exceeding the past two fiscal years combined.

OUR VIEW: Trump earns place in history with how America treats migrant children

Because of an outdated legal framework, there are few options for unaccompanied children from Central America. Under current law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prevented from keeping children together with close relatives who aren’t their parent or legal guardian. Only Congress can change that. Legally, these children cannot be repatriated back home nor can they simply be released into the interior of the USA. They must be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for placement with a sponsor.

This year’s backlogs in transferring children ages 12 and under from Border Patrol custody to HHS did not exist last year. But, as the numbers of families and children illegally crossing the border repeatedly spiked to historic levels, it exceeded the fixed space and beds of HHS. That’s why, in April, federal agencies that had exhausted their budgets for housing children requested emergency funding to avoid this very crisis of children held at inadequate Border Patrol facilities.

Unfortunately, Congress didn’t pass emergency funding until June 27, almost two months later.

Based on our review, Homeland Security has done all it reasonably could with limited resources to care for children who should have been transferred from Border Patrol to HHS custody within 72 hours, and ideally for tender aged children within 24 hours. The Border Patrol did not cause this crisis; our broken immigration system did.

To fix this problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding. With passage of the supplemental funding, Congress has demonstrated that it has the capacity to change the law if members have the will.

23 states now oppose EPA fuel economy freeze,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123951_23-states-now-oppose-epa-fuel-economy-freeze,"The number of states that oppose President Trump's efforts to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards is growing.

In June last year, 16 states and Washington, DC, sued the federal government over the proposal before it was even released.

On Tuesday, governors of 23 states plus Puerto Rico released a joint statement urging the Trump administration to reconsider its proposal to freeze the standards through 2026.

“Strong vehicle standards protect our communities from unnecessary air pollution and fuel costs, and they address the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States,” they said in the letter.

The proposal announced last August by the EPA and NHTSA, called the Safe, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule, is a signature part of President Trump's efforts to reverse Obama administration programs to combat climate change.

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

Current emissions regulations require cars and trucks to meet steadily rising fuel-economy standards through 2025. The proposed SAFER rule would freeze those increases at 2020 levels through 2025. After a public comment period on the new proposal ended last October, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told Reuters on Monday that he expects to release a modified final rule later this summer.

Originally, California was joined in the lawsuit by Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington state, as well as DC. Most, though not all of those states follow California's clean air standards, which are tighter than the EPA's. Under a 1970 extension of the Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to set tighter standards than the federal government, because its clean air standards predate the EPA. Other states can choose to follow either federal or California standards (including an electric-vehicle mandate), but cannot set their own.

The latest letter adds support from both Democratic and Republican governors of some key electoral swing states, such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, plus New Mexico and Montana. Together the governors, who are all part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, represent 52 percent of the U.S. population and 57 percent of the economy.

Automakers, who originally asked President Trump to revisit current Obama-era standards, have also implored the Trump administration not to freeze the standards. They've asked the administration to find a compromise with California to produce a single set of national standards that incorporate annual increases, though smaller ones than those passed under the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the Auto Alliance, a lobbying group representing most major automakers, issued a statement urging states and the federal government to ""find a middle ground that raises standards year over year while aligning with market demand.”

Instead, it looks likely that the question will face a protracted court battle resulting in years of uncertainty over emissions and fuel economy standards—as well as, perhaps, long-term requirements for electric cars."
Justice Department probing Deutsche Bank’s dealings with Malaysia’s 1MDB,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/justice-department-probing-deutsche-banks-dealings-with-malaysias-1mdb/,"The US Justice Department is investigating whether Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in an $8.34 billion restructuring program.

Deutsche Bank’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2 billion in 2014 as concerns about the fund’s management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

Prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said.

She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added.

In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund.

“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters.

“This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” it added.

A DoJ civil asset forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.

Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier whom the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.

A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."

Forty-seven days later, none of the weapons have been transferred to either country, according to a top State Department official, drawing outrage from Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who said it undermines the administration's argument that there was an emergency.

""How would sales that will not be delivered for many, many, months immediately respond to an emergency?"" asked Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""I urge you to take another look at the definition of 'emergency' and re-think your approach to engaging Congress.""

Menendez was one of several lawmakers who grilled R. Clarke Cooper, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, on Wednesday. Cooper defended the administration's decision to use the emergency clause as necessary because of the imminent Iranian threat and the need to support the two American partners, even after the Senate passed resolutions of disapproval against every one of the sales -- 22 in total.

While the emergency approval has allowed training and servicing missions to continue uninterrupted, according to Cooper, none of the military hardware had been transferred yet. Menendez added that only three out of eight sales of weapons or equipment had been formally submitted in a U.S. government contract -- something Cooper said he could not confirm.

It wasn't just Democrats who laid into Cooper though. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he voted against the resolutions of disapproval because he agrees with the administration that the U.S. should arm its partner Saudi Arabia against Iranian aggression.

But ""the process that the State Department followed for these weapons sales ... was crap,"" he said, criticizing the decision to ""circumvent the law and act unilaterally. ... It was foolishness.""

Cruz warned that if the administration made a similar move again, they would lose his and other Republicans' support -- although Pompeo has already made clear that this was a one-time move.

""The simpler process is follow the damn law and respect it,"" Cruz added.

Immediately after, Democrat Chris Coons congratulated Cooper for ""managing to achieve a rare moment of bipartisanship on this committee. I can tell you, it's not often that my colleague from Texas and I agree completely on a matter,"" eliciting laughs.

Cooper deflected several questions about the Saudis and Emiratis' troubled histories with U.S. arms, especially their air war against Iran-supported Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen. In one exchange, he refused to acknowledge data that civilian casualties from the two countries' airstrikes in Yemen had doubled in the last year, which an exasperated Sen. Chris Murphy called ""maddening.""

Instead, Cooper defended the administration's record on pressing the Saudis and Emiratis on human rights in their societies while working with them on security challenges in the region: ""We can do both,"" he said.

But Congress has been increasingly concerned with President Trump's relationship, particularly with the Saudis, and the aggressive behavior of the kingdom's young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader. In particular, lawmakers have said business as usual must end after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the country's consulate in Istanbul. Instead, Trump and top aides like Pompeo have doubled down on the Saudi relationship and dismissed Congress's concerns.

""The hearing we're having today is just the very tip of the iceberg about what Congress needs to do to exercise oversight about why there is such a departure from the ordinary course of business on matters of such national security sensitivity with respect to Saudi Arabia,"" said Democrat Tim Kaine, noting the emergency arms sales, the transfer of nuclear technology to the Saudis, and refusal to make a determination on Prince Mohammed's role in Khashoggi's killing, among others."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Trump administration will issue licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei,https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/us-will-issue-licenses-to-sell-to-huawei-says-commerce-secretary-ross.html,"A man walking past a Huawei P20 smartphone advertisement is reflected in a glass door in front of a Huawei logo, at a shopping mall in Shanghai, China December 6, 2018.

The U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell American-made goods to China's Huawei where there is no threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday, but left key questions unanswered about what products will pass muster.

Seeking to revive trade talks with China, U.S. President Donald Trump announced late last month that American companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.

Trump's comments came after the United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.

While American chipmakers welcomed Trump's announcement, many industry and government officials were confused about the new policy.

Speaking at an annual department conference in Washington, Ross affirmed that the company would remain on the Entity List, which meant licenses would likely be denied and that the new policy would not change the scope of items requiring licenses. However, he also said there would be some approvals.

""To implement the president's G20 summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,"" Ross said, referring to Trump's announcement at the meeting of world leaders in Japan.

""Within those confines, we will try to make sure that we don't just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms,"" he said.

After Huawei was added to the Entity List, the semiconductor industry lobbied the U.S. government for carve-outs to sell nonsensitive items that Huawei could easily buy abroad, arguing that a blanket ban would harm American companies.

On Tuesday, industry observers said Ross's comments lacked the clarity and relief many hoped for after Trump's announcement.

""The actual policy of what is not going to endanger U.S. security is not clear,"" Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said. ""The only way that industry can determine the line is by submitting (license) applications and knowing what types will be approved and which types will be denied.""

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."
"Teen migrant claims Border Patrol agent sexually assaulted her, sparking federal investigation",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Meagan Flynn', 'Morning Mix Reporter', ""Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team. She Was Previously A Reporter At The Houston Chronicle"", 'The Houston Press.']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/07/10/teen-migrants-allegations-sexual-assault-by-arizona-border-agent-sparks-federal-investigation/,"

Authorities are investigating a complaint from a 15-year-old migrant girl that a U.S. border agent sexually assaulted her while she was detained in a facility in Yuma, Ariz., Customs and Border Protection said on Tuesday night.

The allegations are contained in an internal report obtained by NBC News. The teenager from Honduras said a CBP officer put his hands inside her bra, pulled down her underwear and groped her, under the guise of a routine pat-down search, NBC reported. She reported he was laughing with the other guards in plain view of other migrants, leading her to feel embarrassed.

A spokesman for CBP confirmed in a statement to The Washington Post that the complaint is under investigation, along with other claims of mistreatment and retaliation against children contained in the incident reports compiled by Department of Health and Human Services case managers and cited by NBC.

“The allegations do not align with common practice at our facilities and will be fully investigated,” the CBP spokesman said. “It’s important to note that the allegation of sexual assault is already under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General.”

The latest allegations of mistreatment of child migrants come as CBP’s overcrowded detention facilities face mounting scrutiny, with detained children describing awful experiences ranging from a lack of basic hygiene products to being forced to sleep on a concrete floor. Although border arrests fell 28 percent in June, DHS officials said the situation in the region remained an “acute and worsening crisis.” On Monday, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said she was “deeply shocked” by the conditions.

[U.N. human rights chief ‘deeply shocked’ by migrant detention center conditions in Texas]

The allegations contained in the HHS incident reports cited by NBC, however, go beyond poor conditions caused by overcrowding and describe alleged deliberate mistreatment by CBP agents. Children described feeling afraid to ask for anything because agents would punish them for complaining. Others said guards hurled derogatory language at them, calling some “puto,” an anti-gay slur in Spanish, while giving orders, NBC reported. One boy said he wore soiled underwear for 10 days because he feared asking for a clean pair. A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy said agents took away mats from him and the other boys in his cell after they complained about the food and water. Instead, they slept on the bare concrete, NBC reported.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told the news outlet the “very concerning” allegations “need to be fully investigated.”

The complaints cited by NBC all came from one facility in Yuma, but federal court documents suggest retaliation against children may occur elsewhere, too.

Last month, attorneys visited several Border Patrol detention facilities in the Rio Grande Valley to interview dozens of detained children. They were investigating whether the federal government was complying with a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires that children be kept in “safe and sanitary conditions.”

The dozens of interviews, filed in federal court, also contain reports of retaliation and physical abuse. At least one girl said she was so afraid of retaliation by guards that she refused to allow attorneys to put her name on her declaration.

In another case, a 7-year-old girl said that children in her cell were found to have lice and so agents gave the other girls in the cell one lice comb each night as a preventive measure. But when the girls lost the comb, the guard punished them by taking away their mats and blankets, she said.

“We all slept on the hard tile floor last night,” she said.

Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University, told The Washington Post last month that when she alerted agents to that claim, they denied it. “I’m like, I’ve got a cell full of kids telling me that’s exactly what happened,” Binford told The Post.

One minor who had been detained in McAllen, Tex., for 21 days, without a shower or a phone call, claimed she witnessed CBP agents hit child migrants in the stomach but said the guards “try to intimidate us into not reporting these types of things,” according to the court filing. She claimed one officer warned that if they reported an assault that they couldn’t prove was true, they could go to jail for 25 years.

Another child, a 12-year-old, said the guards were “mean and scary.” One day, the boy said, a guard came in to the cell demanding to know who had “snuck food in the cell.” One hungry teenager cowered. He had smuggled in a burrito, pudding and juice. When the guards found his stash, they handcuffed him, the boy said. “My cousin and I were very shocked and scared,” he said.

Like the children in Yuma, others interviewed by lawyers who visited the Rio Grande Valley facilities said they were afraid to ask agents for food, to raise the temperature or to take a shower.

“The staff is so abusive I am afraid to ask for anything,” one teen mother detained in McAllen said in Spanish. “Yesterday, my baby was crying because he was hungry and the staff said to me, ‘Hey, take care of your baby. It’s okay to have them but you have to take care of them.’ They didn’t bring me any food for him.”

Another teen mom said that when a male guard at the Clint, Tex., facility saw her crying he asked, “Why did you come here if you don’t like it?” “When I think about what he said, I start to cry,” she said. “It is so difficult to be here.”

Only a few children said they weren’t scared. “No one scolds me or is mean here,” one 8-year-old detained at Clint said, adding that the “kids take care of each other.” “It is okay but I want to see my parents.”

The sworn declarations were filed as evidence last month as attorneys sought emergency relief from U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee and immediate remedies to fix the overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.

[Attorneys seek emergency court order to end ‘health and welfare crisis’ in migrant detention centers]

In a June 28 order, Gee ordered the federal government and attorneys for the children to work with an independent monitor to develop a plan to remedy the conditions at the detention facilities. In her three-page order, Gee appeared irked that the government did not already have a plan, given the Flores Settlement Agreement has been in place for two decades.

“If 22 years has not been sufficient time for Defendants to refine that plan in a manner consistent with their ‘concern for the vulnerability of minors’ and their obligation to maintain facilities that are consistently ‘safe and sanitary,’ it is imperative,” Gee wrote, that they make a plan right now.

The parties are expected to file a report on their progress by Friday.

His comments provided a little more clarity after President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, where Trump made the surprise announcement that U.S. companies could sell their equipment to Huawei where there’s “no great national security problem with it.”

“To implement the President’s G-20 Summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,” Ross reiterated at the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) annual conference on export controls and security. “Within those confines we will try to make sure that we don’t just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms. Huawei itself remains on the Entity List, and the announcement does not change the scope of items requiring licenses from the Commerce Department, nor the presumption of denial.”

Separately, at a CNBC event on Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said with respect to the private markets, the U.S. had “opened the door—relaxed a bit, the licensing requirements from the Commerce Department” where there are no national security consequences.

The U.S. government isn’t going to be purchasing any Huawei products, but some of the U.S. chip companies would be permitted to sell on a limited basis to Huawei. “We are opening that up for a limited time period,” he added.

Trey Gowdy: DOJ inspector general interviewed 'seminal' witness in FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trey-gowdy-doj-inspector-general-interviewed-seminal-witness-in-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy applauded the Justice Department inspector general for grilling the ""seminal"" witness in its investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

It was revealed Tuesday that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's team conducted a two-day interview in London with British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the unsubstantiated and salacious dossier attacking President Trump.

Gowdy said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the development during a Fox & Friends interview on Wednesday.

""The only way Michael Horowitz can issue the kind of report that he wants to issue, that we would benefit from, is to interview every single witness. I cannot imagine a more seminal witness than Christopher Steele,"" Gowdy said. ""So, kudos to them for going to Europe and interviewing him because they certainly couldn’t make him come here.""

Three attorneys from the DOJ inspector general’s team met with Steele in person in London in early June, during Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Although Attorney General William Barr predicted that the inquiry would wrap up by June, investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation indefinitely.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and DOJ filing of four FISA applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign.

Gowdy, a former chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he has not spoken to former colleagues or Horowitz for updates on the investigation, but he did offer some perspective.

""The good thing about Michael Horowitz is he's happy to talk to anyone about timing, but he's not going to talk about substance. And I’m not a member anymore, so I would not even ask him about timing,"" Gowdy said. ""I've heard it's been delayed a little bit, in part because of the new witnesses that have come forward. And also in part, I mean think, Horowitz is having to read this report in a SCIF, in a secure room. A lot of the report is going to be classified. I think, look, we all wanted it yesterday, but I’m willing to postpone when I get it to have the most thorough accounting of what happened over that year-and-a-half time period as possible.""

Gowdy was also asked who else he wants the inspector general to interview.

""I don’t know everyone that Horowitz has interviewed, but you’re going to have to hear with respect to that factual predicate in early 2016. You know, we repeatedly asked the bureau when did the investigation into the Trump campaign begin, they always said July of 2016, which is when [former FBI agent] Peter Strzok initiated it,"" Gowdy said. ""I want to talk, I want to talk to the agent who was handling Steele. I want to talk to anyone who can shed light when the world’s premier, most powerful law enforcement agency decided to investigate a presidential campaign. Look, Horowitz was a prosecutor before he became IG. Really smart guy. There is nothing I can tell him he doesn’t already know. Go find everyone who knows anything. And then, write the most thorough, apolitical report you possibly can."""
Senators and State Department at Each Other’s Throats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Political Reporter']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-and-state-department-at-each-others-throats,"On Friday, June 28, an email with an odd subject line hit the inboxes of the Senate’s top national security staffers.

“RE: Gabriel—does this look good to you?” it read.

Beneath the cryptic subject line was an invitation from the State Department asking Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff to join a question-and-answer conference call with a top official working on Iran policy.

The call, on the following Monday, did not go well. Staff had been eager—and impatient—to hear how the administration would handle Iran’s decision to amp up its uranium enrichment. But after reading a bland statement full of already public information, Matt McInnis, a political appointee who works on Iran policy, said a technical difficulty meant he couldn’t take questions. The whole call lasted less than 10 minutes, according to multiple people on it.

“It was insulting,” said one staffer on the call. “It was such a box-checking exercise for them.” Another staffer described feelings of amusement mixed with horror.

For participants, the blunders were a microcosm of the metastasizing tensions between SFRC and the State Department. The committee is supposed to oversee the department. But five Hill staffers familiar with its work told The Daily Beast it has struggled under the leadership of Chairman Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump ally who wasn’t distinguished for broad foreign policy chops when he ascended to the post. Before Risch took the gavel, Sen. Bob Corker—who retired last year—ran the committee. While Corker was a traditional Republican who almost always voted with President Trump, he used the post to lambaste the administration’s frequently perplexing foreign policy choices. He even called the White House “an adult day care center.”

Under Risch, things are different. The conservative from Idaho has taken a much more deferential approach and is loath to publicly criticize the administration. He has yet to schedule open hearings on the war in Libya, the violent unrest in Sudan, and the free trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico.

Multiple staff blamed Risch’s non-combative approach for the committee’s struggles to get briefings and testimony from the department. And they point to debacles like the Iran conference call as evidence of the department’s disregard for the committee.

Risch’s defenders, meanwhile, say he engages in effective behind-the-scenes advocacy to the president and that until a few months ago, there were hardly any Senate-confirmed senior State Department officials who could testify. They also credit Risch with securing a long-awaited classified briefing from Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, though Democrats say they’re still frustrated Khalilzad hasn’t testified publicly.

The committee still has trouble getting answers. To this day, according to two staffers, the department has yet to provide the committee with a copy of the U.S./Mexico agreement on tariffs that Trump himself waved around in front of news cameras on June 11. Committee staff have sent weekly emails to the State Department—for months now—asking for details on the administration’s decision to cut aid to Central American countries and have yet to get substantive answers to their questions, per one aide.

“ It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration. ” — Senate aide

“It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration,” another aide said.

“We get very much a head-pat acknowledgement,” said a third staffer. “Kind of, ‘There, there, Congress, we’ll tell you the bare minimum and that’s that.”

Suzanne Wrasse, the communications director for Risch on the committee, said the chairman effectively advocates for SFRC.

“The chairman is a pragmatic lawmaker with a long history of working ‘behind the scenes’ to get results, not to make political points,” she said. “He is in regular contact with the president and his senior advisers, and has used his stature to deliver results for the committee on a bipartisan basis.”

Risch has also touted his warm relationship with Trump.

“He has treated me with nothing but respect and listened carefully to what I had to say, and sometimes I was able to move him,” the senator said in a February Roll Call interview. “Sometimes a little bit, sometimes more than a little bit. Sometimes not at all.”

One tense moment came when the administration decided to use an emergency declaration to green-light billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Traditionally, the State Department consults with SFRC on arms sales—but not this time. And it wasn’t for lack of talking; in the days leading up to the declaration, there was communication on the Iran situation between senior Trump administration officials and the Senate. Sec. Mike Pompeo and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a members-only briefing for senators just two days before the arms announcement. But the topic of an emergency declaration didn’t come up in that briefing, according to people familiar with it. Instead, SFRC staff found out about the arms deals the day the administration announced them, on May 24.

That day, State set up another conference call for congressional staff to explain their move. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary for political-military affairs, was on the call. At one point, a staffer pushed Cooper on why the department hadn’t worked with Congress on the move, given its oversight responsibility.

“That’s a matter of semantics,” Cooper replied, according to a source who was on the call—which then exploded. To some listeners, Cooper’s comment sounded like a glib write-off of Congress’s constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable.

Reached for comment on this incident, a State Department spokesperson pointed to congressional testimony Cooper gave several weeks later, where he said the department “value[s] deeply this Committee’s and Congress’ role more broadly in the review of the arms transfer process.”

The frustrations are percolating as Trump faces some of his thorniest foreign policy dilemmas yet. Just weeks ago, the president said he nearly green-lit a strike on Iranian targets that could have killed scores of people. Instead, the president deferred to the non-interventionists in his orbit—including Fox News host Tucker Carlson. But as crises materialize like it’s Whack-A-Mole, staff working with the committee responsible for overseeing American diplomacy say it’s in the dark. And they have to wonder: How could this administration handle negotiations with the Iranians if they can barely run a conference call about them?"
"Trump intervention delaying EPA biofuel waiver action, sources say",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-ethanol/trump-intervention-delaying-epa-biofuel-waiver-action-sources-say-idUSKCN1U52BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s request for a review of the administration’s expanded use of biofuel waivers for oil refiners is holding up its decisions on 2018 applications, according to three sources familiar with the matter, two of whom said Trump may soon host a meeting on the issue.

Trump had ordered (here) members of his Cabinet to review the controversial waiver program, which exempts small refiners in financial turmoil from their obligation to blend ethanol into gasoline, last month after hearing from farmers angry about the issue during his recent Midwest tour.

Since Trump took office, the Environmental Protection Agency has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging another key constituency - corn growers - who claim the move threatens ethanol demand.

Since Trump’s request for a review, the EPA has been scrambling to come up with a solution to move forward with 40 pending applications for the waivers, called Small Refinery Exemptions or SREs, covering 2018.

“The SRE decision is being held up because the President wants to have this conversation,” one of the sources familiar with the issue said.

Two sources said the White House could host a meeting next week on the issue that would include Trump, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, and senators from both oil and farm states.

There was no final decision yet on whether a meeting would be held, or when, they said.

All three of the sources said that the 2018 SRE decisions were nearly finalized before Trump became involved.

The White House declined to comment.

The EPA responded to a request for comment by saying it was implementing biofuel policy in accordance with the law.

“We will work with the White House, DOE, USDA, members of Congress and other stakeholders to ensure the proper administration of the (Renewable Fuel Standard),” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an emailed statement.

The Department of Energy provided the EPA its scoring results for the 40 outstanding 2018 applications in late April, sources told Reuters. EPA is required to decide on applications no later than 90 days after receiving them.

Some refiners say they filed their applications far earlier than April, and say the EPA is already late.

POLITICAL TIGHTROPE

The Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than decade-old regulation that is aimed at helping farmers and reducing U.S. dependence on oil, has been a big point of contention between the rivaling oil and corn industries, leaving Trump struggling to find a balance between the two important constituencies as he eyes a bid for re-election next year.

The regulation requires refiners to blend increasing volumes of ethanol and other biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase credits from those that do. But it also allows refining facilities of less than 75,000 barrels per day to request waivers if they can prove that complying with the law would cause them disproportionate financial hardship.

Small refineries owned by giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with a facility owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn have secured waivers from Trump’s EPA, according to Reuters reporting.

Trump’s request that Cabinet members, including Agriculture Secretary Perdue, help hash out a fix to the waiver program has become a source of concern for lawmakers representing oil refining states. Perdue has often publicly criticized the EPA’s administration of the waiver program, siding with farmers.

Last week, Republican senators representing oil states wrote to Trump asking him to keep Perdue away from any decision-making process over the petitions. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also wrote to Perdue saying he will block confirmation of agency nominations until Perdue “stops interfering.”"

Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'Kyle Smith', 'Robert Verbruggen', 'A. G.

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."

This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
House passes legislation to remove gendered references to presidents in a US law,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Nicholas Wu', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/10/house-passes-law-removing-gendered-references-president/1696975001/,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed legislation to remove gendered references to presidents in a U.S. law.

The bill, H.R. 677, the ""21st Century President Act,"" would amend part of an existing U.S. law making it a crime to threaten the president or the president's family. This law currently defines the spouse as female and the president as male, and states that the president's spouse is ""the wife of a former President during his lifetime, the widow of a former President until her death or remarriage.""

The new legislation would change that section to be ""the spouse of a former President during a former President’s lifetime, the surviving spouse of a former President until the surviving spouse’s death or remarriage.""

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., who introduced the legislation, noted that it would help clear the way for a female or gay president to be elected. Pocan, who is the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is openly gay.

""The current field of presidential candidates looks more like American society than ever before. We are closer than ever to the possibility that a woman or an LGBT person could hold the country's highest office,"" said Pocan on the House floor. ""Currently federal law does not reflect the reality we could have a female or a gay president as soon as 2021.""

Rep. Doug Collins R-Ga., took the floor to implore the House to vote for the bill.

""I think the bill is a good bill that does exactly what it needs to do and then clarifies for the future and would encourage everyone to vote yes,"" said Collins.

The bill passed by a simple voice vote, with no members of Congress objecting.

The 2020 Democratic field currently features six women running for president: Sens. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and Marianne Williamson. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg could be the first openly gay president.

It is unclear what future the bill has in the Republican-controlled Senate, or if President Donald Trump would sign the legislation.
