Fact-check: Trump makes series of false claims in two-day New York tweetstorm,https://www.cnn.com,"['Daniel Dale', 'Cristina Alesci']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/politics/fact-check-trump-false-new-york-tweetstorm/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made a series of false claims on Monday and Tuesday while lashing out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James on Twitter.

The focus of the President's complaints in the six tweets was the state lawsuit against his non-profit, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which was filed last year by James's predecessor Barbara Underwood. But Trump also made inaccurate statements about former state attorney general Eric Schneiderman, about migration from New York state, and about the National Rifle Association.

Foundation spending

""I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away more money than it had,"" he tweeted on Monday. He continued in another tweet: ""That's right, The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus...""

Facts First: It appears Trump is correct here: his foundation did give away more money in contributions, grants and gifts than it received in most years, according to a CNN review of the foundation's IRS filings for 2012 through 2016. But that doesn't mean the lawsuit his baseless, as he seems to suggest.

How did Trump's foundation pay out more than it received? By using some of its assets to make grants in excess of its revenue for any given year, said Holly Ivel, a spokeswoman for Candid, an organization that collects data and provides analysis on nonprofits.

Trump, however, is suggesting without evidence that the foundation's low expenses and its high rate of giving means that the New York lawsuit against it is unfair.

The lawsuit is unrelated to the foundation's level of expenses or its rate of giving. It's not about whether money left the foundation but about how those funds were used.

The lawsuit alleges that the foundation -- along with its directors, which included the President, his sons Eric and Donald Jr. and daughter Ivanka -- engaged in a ""pattern"" of persistent illegal conduct for over a decade. The lawsuit accuses them of using foundation assets for the personal and political benefit of the president.

While the foundation had very low expenses -- most years, the only expense listed was an accountants' fee -- that's not necessarily an indication a foundation is complying with the law. Also, a very small expense line alone isn't necessary a sign of a well-run and efficient non-profit, Ivel said.

In December, Donald Trump came to an agreement with the attorney general to shut down the foundation under judicial supervision.

Eric Schneiderman

Trump tweeted Monday that the New York legal campaign against his foundation has been ""going on for years, originally brought by Crooked Hillary's Campaign Chair, A.G. Eric Schneiderman, until forced to resign for abuse against women.""

Facts First: Schneiderman was not Hillary Clinton's ""Campaign Chair."" Rather, he was one of : Schneiderman was not Hillary Clinton's ""Campaign Chair."" Rather, he was one of more than 100 people on her New York ""leadership council,"" which included, among others, every Democratic member of Congress from the state.

Schneiderman did launch the investigation into the Trump Foundation, in 2016. He did resign under pressure, in 2018, after The New Yorker reported on allegations that he had assaulted four women. (He issued a statement saying ""I have not assaulted anyone"" and that he had engaged in consensual ""role-playing."" After prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges against him, he issued another statement apologizing for ""any and all pain that I have caused"" and accepting ""full responsibility"" for his conduct toward his accusers.)

The Clinton Foundation

""They never even looked at the disgusting Clinton Foundation,"" Trump tweeted on Monday.

Facts First: This is essentially true. The New York attorney general's office has indeed not conducted an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. But Schneiderman : This is essentially true. The New York attorney general's office has indeed not conducted an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. But Schneiderman told Politico in 2016 that he did not think that the facts warranted an investigation, and there is no proof of illegality by the Clinton Foundation.

Schneiderman rejected Clinton critics' calls to investigate foreign donations to the foundation, saying that no New York attorney general of either party had found that New York foundations are required to report on the money they receive from foreign governments.

Migration from New York

""No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!"" Trump tweeted on Monday.

Facts First: While New York has experienced a recent population decline, it's false to claim that its out-migration is record-setting.

The state population fell by 48,510 people in 2018, the biggest decline in the country, Census Bureau figures show. As of the end of 2018, New York had experienced an estimated net loss of 1.2 million people on account of migration within the US this decade, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank that has long studied migration data for the state. In other words, 1.2 million more people left New York for other states than moved to New York from other states.

That is a substantial number. However, New York experienced a much sharper decline from domestic migration in the 1970s, when concerns about crime and decay drove an exodus from New York City. Between 1970 and 1980, the Empire Center reports, the state lost a net 2.4 million people through domestic migration.

""NY is not losing residents at a record pace,"" E.J. McMahon, research director for the Empire Center, said in an email. ""The 'people fleeing' record was in the 1970s, when the net domestic migration actually reached more than 300,000 people in some years, and net migration (including foreigners moving in) was negative-200,000 a couple of times.""

New York's population increased by an estimated 0.8% between 2010 and 2018, according to the Census Bureau. Cuomo took office in 2011.

Cuomo's role

""Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes,"" Trump tweeted Monday. He added: ""Now Cuomo's A.G. is harassing all of my New York businesses.""

Facts First: There is no public evidence that Cuomo has pushed the state attorney general to take action against the Trump Foundation.

It is theoretically possible, of course, but there is simply no proof of any improper Cuomo influence here. Letitia James, a vocal opponent of Trump, was directly elected, not appointed by the governor.

""The people of the state choose the attorney general. So his suggestion that it's my attorney general is just incorrect. I don't have an attorney general,"" Cuomo told reporters on Monday, Politico reported. Cuomo also said that Trump's claim ""shows that his paranoia is once again getting the better of him.""

James said on Twitter on Monday: ""As the elected AG of NY, I have a sworn duty to protect & uphold state law. My office will follow the facts of any case, wherever they lead. Make no mistake: No one is above the law, not even the President.""

The National Rifle Association

""And if they are a victim of harassment by the A.G. of the state, like what they are doing to our great NRA, which I think will move quickly to Texas, where they are loved...Texas will defend them & indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.

Facts First: The National Rifle Association is based in Virginia, not New York. It was chartered in New York, in 1871, so the New York attorney general does have jurisdiction over it.

Both Cuomo and James have challenged the NRA."
Trump claims army 'took over airports' in 1775,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-48879825/trump-claims-army-took-over-airports-in-1775,"Video

A speech delivered by President Trump at Independence Day celebrations contained historical errors.

At the event in Washington DC, for the 4th of July “Salute to America”, he referred to airports existing in 1775.

The mistake was attributed by some US media outlets to difficulty reading the teleprompter.

The US president also mixed up the War of 1812 with the War of Independence."
"Record 157,005,000 Employed; 19th Record of Trump Era",https://www.cnsnews.com,['Susan Jones'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/157005000-employed-june-19th-record-trump-era,"(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)

(CNSNews.com) - After the Fourth of July fireworks, the fifth of July brings another reason for Americans to celebrate.

A record 157,005,000 people were employed in June, the most since February and the 19th record of Trump's presidency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

And the economy added a strong 224,000 jobs in June, well above the estimate of 160,000.

The unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years, ticked up a tenth of a point to 3.7 percent.

In June, the nation’s civilian noninstitutionalized population, consisting of all people age 16 or older who were not in the military or an institution, reached 259,037,000. Of those, 162,981,000 participated in the labor force by either holding a job or actively seeking one.

The 162,981,000 who participated in the labor force equaled 62.9 percent of the 259,037,000 civilian noninstitutionalized population. That's up a tenth of a point from May's 62.8 percent participation rate. The payroll taxes paid by people who participate in the labor force help support those who do not participate, so the higher this number, the better.

The participation rate reached a record high of 67.3 percent in early 2000; the highest it's been under Trump is 63.2 percent.

The number of Americans not in the labor force, meaning they did not have a job and were not looking for one, dropped by 158,000 last month to 96,057,000 but this number remains near historic highs, as the Baby Boom generation accelerates into retirement.

Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.3 percent), teenagers (12.7 percent), Whites (3.3 percent), Blacks (6.0 percent), Asians (2.1 percent), and Hispanics (4.3 percent) showed little or no change in June.

The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April was revised down from +224,000 to +216,000, and the change for May was revised down from +75,000 to +72,000. After revisions, job gains have averaged 171,000 per month over the last 3 months.

And wages continue rising: In June, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 6 cents to $27.90, following a 9-cent gain in May. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 3.1 percent.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in a June 25 speech, said the economy has performed ""reasonably well"" so far this year, with continued growth and strong job creation keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows.

But Powell also mentioned ""some ongoing cross-currents,"" including trade uncertainty and incoming data about the strength of the global economy.

He said the Fed ""will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion..."" That could mean lower interest rates -- or not, if the employment and job numbers remain strong.

President Trump hailed the strong employment report on his way out of town Friday morning:"

Following remarks that celebrated America's history and honored the U.S. military, the liberal news network launched a firing squad beginning with former President Obama official and CNN analyst John Kirby saying he was ""troubled about the militaristic tone"" of the event.

""We were treated to essentially eighth-grade history that was fairly sepia-toned and saccharine in its depth and context. In fact, it was lacking a lot of depth and context and I heard nothing other than a pledge to put the American flag on Mars,"" Kirby told the panel. ""I could have gotten this off of watching 'Schoolhouse Rock' and I frankly didn't need all the militaristic, you know, displays of might. I think it's just, again, not who we are as a country.""

TRUMP DEFIES OMINOUS PREDICTIONS WITH SPEECH NONPARTISAN JULY 4TH SPEECH

Senior political analyst Ryan Lizza knocked Trump's speechwriters, saying they ""are not the best in the business"" and noting that those from other presidencies have been a ""whole lot better."" He did credit the president, however, for not going on ""lunatic tangents.""

""Sometimes, it just seems like he's reading from a Wikipedia page about historical events,"" Lizza said.

Anti-Trump White House reporter April Ryan listed all the negatives things she was ""reminded of"" during Trump's speech, like the passing of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., when the president spoke about the military. She also connected his remarks about the women's suffrage movement to ""voter suppression"" taking place today and linked his praise for the Greensboro Lunch Counter protesters in the civil rights movement to his condemnation of the ""exonerated"" Central Park Five suspects.

""If you didn't know better, this president is trying to recreate his history before he celebrated the military,"" Ryan elaborated. ""If you didn't know better, if you didn't fact-check and go back to what he said or had done about certain issues, it would be a soaring speech. But for someone who covers him day in and day out and understands some of the issues... there are a lot of things in this speech that he — it may have been 'Schoolhouse Rock Trump' version, but nonetheless we still have to fact-check and it was his attempt at a soaring moment for history.""

CNN's Phil Mudd also completely trashed the speech.

""On a professional level with over 25 years in national security, I hated it. And on a personal level, I hated it even more,"" Mudd said. ""Can we actually have a day with hamburgers, hot dogs, and a few beers without a politician? Please, one day! And now we can't because now we've got a politician saying, 'Let's celebrate guns and aircraft and forget about the Founding Fathers who talked about being cautious with the standing military."""
Census citizenship question: Justice Department tells court it is looking at options,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Kevin Liptak', 'Gregory Wallace']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/politics/census-citizenship-question-deadline-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Lawyers for the Department of Justice told a federal judge in Maryland Friday afternoon that the Trump administration will continue to explore options of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but made no mention of a potential executive order being considered by the White House.

An administration official stressed that as of now the census will be printed without the citizenship question, though discussions are continuing about how to challenge last week's Supreme Court ruling blocking the Census Bureau from adding it to the questionnaire.

Earlier Friday, President Donald Trump said he is considering his options, which include an executive order or a potential addendum to the questionnaire that would allow the question to be added at a later date. Such a move could require the administration to provide a new justification for the addition of the question, following a Supreme Court ruling requiring a new rationale.

In its court filing, the Justice Department said the administration continues to ""reevaluate all available options.""

The filing goes almost directly against Judge George Hazel's previous order to Justice to provide an answer on its plans, and instead attempts to pause the court action while the Justice Department considers its options. Hazel had not yet responded to the filings on Friday afternoon.

He told the Justice Department earlier this week that if the administration refused to definitively say it will not add a citizenship question to the census, he would establish a schedule to hear new evidence over the next 45 days. A parallel proceeding will continue in New York as well.

The Justice Department in its filing argued that schedule should be paused while lawyers search for a ""new rationale for reinstating a citizenship question"" -- a move made possible by the wording of the Supreme Court ruling, which left the door open for the administration to try again to add the controversial question.

Civil rights groups argue it could scare off legal immigrants and others from responding, leading to undercounts.

The plaintiffs in the case argued in their filing on Friday that their case should go ahead on schedule, saying the government could not erase questions about discriminatory intent ""merely by pretending that the same or a similar decision is somehow 'new' or somehow cures the discriminatory intent that Plaintiffs have established as motivating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 census.""

It was not immediately clear when the judge would rule on the scheduling issue.

Trump, who has been increasingly frustrated over the issue, has been encouraging his lawyers and aides to find a way to include the disputed citizenship question and did not on Friday rule out the possibility of signing an executive order.

""It's one of the ways -- we have four or five ways we can do it,"" Trump told reporters earlier Friday on the White House lawn. ""It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously.""

Moves by the Justice Department to satisfy Trump would mean that the administration would face daunting legal challenges and a tenuous timeline as it prepares for the decennial population survey, which is used to set electoral boundaries as well as to determine how government funding is distributed for an array of programs.

A legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions over the last several days with Trump administration officials on the citizenship question said that while the administration is considering its options, lawyers are drafting potential language for an executive order. The source stressed that other options are on the table, but that some outside advisers believe that an executive order could pass legal muster.

Earlier this week an administration official called that option unrealistic, but others are pushing for that option.

""I believe the Supreme Court will affirm the constitutional right of the President and commerce secretary to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census, in a 5-4 opinion authored by the chief justice of the United States,"" said J. Michael Luttig a former judge who has close ties to top players in the administration.

But critics say courts would be unlikely to agree. They contend that while the Census Act vests power in the commerce secretary to administer the census, the President has no constitutional authority to modify it.

The White House said late Thursday that the President was ""looking at every option.""

Trump threw the situation into disorder earlier this week when he tweeted he wouldn't give up the battle even after his Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the census forms would be printed without the question -- a move the President signed off on earlier in the week. The internal dispute has led the President to privately air frustrations at his 81-year-old commerce secretary.

Trump has been frustrated at Ross's handling of the census issue, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, believing he folded too easily after the Supreme Court ruled on the matter this week.

His frustrations with his commerce secretary started before the high court decision, believing the issue has been mishandled from the start. But in recent days he's told allies that Ross let him down.

At this point it does not appear that Ross will be dismissed, the two people said. But in speaking with advisers, Trump has bemoaned the Commerce Department and the Justice Department for ""giving up,"" according to the people.

He has said that all of his options weren't explored before the announcement earlier this week that the printing would go forward.

The legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions says that when the Department of Justice went forward earlier in the week to say that a citizenship question would not be added to the census, the department got ""ahead of itself."" The source acknowledges that the White House was informed in some form of what DOJ lawyers would argue, but said that there was not ""adequate communication.""

The President remains in contact with outside advisers and is frustrated that the DOJ seemed to be throwing in the towel and has complained that Chief Justice John Roberts should be responsible for the failure to get the question on the census, not the President, according to the source. A continued legal effort, the source contended, might ""force"" Roberts to make a decision.

Trump has aired frustrations at Ross previously. Early in the administration, Trump kept berating him for his handling of China trade talks. He also complained that he fell asleep in meetings. But he's remained on good personal terms with his longtime friend

Trump has said publicly that asking census-takers their citizenship status should be a no-brainer. But opponents say it could deter minorities and immigrants, even those in the United States legally, from taking the survey. That, in turn, could skew electoral maps in favor of Republicans and reduce government assistance programs for some communities.

Administration lawyers were hurrying Friday to prepare for an afternoon deadline to explain how they will proceed in adding the disputed question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

At left, Attorney General William Barr, and, at right Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Trump is facing ""limited options,"" according to a person familiar with the matter, that include a potential executive order or adding the question as a supplement with the upcoming census forms, which are already being printed.

Trump tweeted early Thursday that officials were working on the Independence Day holiday to resolve the issue.

""Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July!"" the President wrote, before departing the White House for his Virginia golf club.

Trump's seemingly out-of-the-blue tweet on Wednesday reversing the administration's stance came as a surprise to the government lawyers tasked with arguing the case.

There was initially consensus among the White House and other top administration officials over the position the Justice Department would take -- that it would go ahead with preparing the census without a line asking ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""

But Trump changed his mind after a hearing Tuesday, according to a source familiar with discussions. Top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Bill Barr, became aware of the pivot before Trump tweeted about it, but lower level attorneys at the Justice Department, including the lawyers who were due in front of a federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday, were not aware of the shift.

The legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions with the Trump administration officials told CNN the President is committed to showing leadership on the issue, adding ""The President has made clear he wants to fight.""

Border Patrol investigates another potential secret Facebook group,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Grace Segers', 'Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-patrol-investigates-another-potential-secret-facebook-group/,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is investigating another potential secret Facebook group where current and former CBP officials allegedly shared mocking images of migrants and derogatory images of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The Facebook group, first reported by CNN, is the second such group being investigated by CBP. This week, ProPublica reported on another private Facebook group, which is called ""I'm 10-15,"" referring to the Border Patrol code for ""aliens in custody."" According to the report, the page was created three years ago for current and former Border Patrol workers, and has about 9,500 members.

In a statement, a CBP spokesperson said that the agency had received screenshots of activity in the second Facebook group and directed its Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate potential employee misconduct.

""If the investigation verifies that employees posted content in violation of CBP's code of conduct, the findings will inform management decisions regarding appropriate disciplinary action,"" the spokesperson said. ""CBP does not tolerate misconduct on or off duty and will hold those who violate our code of conduct accountable.""

""These posts do not reflect the core values of the agency and do not reflect the vast majority of employees who conduct themselves professionally and honorably every day, on and off duty,"" the statement continued.

However, some believe these social media groups are indicative of a corrupt culture at CBP. Ocasio-Cortez said the Facebook page shows a deeper and more disturbing problem within the agency.

""This isn't about 'a few bad eggs.' This is a violent culture,"" she said on Twitter.

""How on earth can CBP's culture be trusted to care for refugees humanely?"" she wrote. ""They're threatening violence on members of Congress. How do you think they're treating caged children+families?""

After her tour of a border detention facility, Ocasio-Cortez wrote in another tweet, ""Just left the 1st CBP facility. I see why CBP officers were being so physically &sexually threatening towards me. Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets. This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress.""

News of these social media groups comes as CBP has been criticized for the treatment of migrants in border detention centers.

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) internal watchdog found squalid conditions in several detention centers for migrant families and children in Texas, including ""serious"" overcrowding, minors going without hot meals for days and detainees begging not to be returned to their cells, according to a new report released Tuesday."

""Effective July 3, these changes will help ensure that patrons within VA have access to religious literature and symbols at chapels as requested and protect representations of faith in publicly accessible displays at facilities throughout the department,"" the VA said in a statement.

Wilkie said the new directive is intended to help protect ""religious liberty"" as part of a broader effort to make sure ""veterans and their families feel welcome at the VA.""

""We want to make sure that all of our Veterans and their families feel welcome at VA, no matter their religious beliefs. Protecting religious liberty is a key part of how we accomplish that goal,"" he said.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."

The Justice Department in Washington in May 2013. (J. David Ake/AP)

Contributing columnist

Pity the poor Justice Department lawyer who draws the short straw these days.

On Wednesday, only 24 hours after assuring a federal district judge that the government would not try to add to the 2020 Census the citizenship question the Supreme Court had blocked, the department suddenly reversed ground.

That left it to a sheepish and bewildered career Justice Department lawyer, Joshua Gardner, to tell Judge George M. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland that he was backing away from firm representations he had made to the court on behalf of the federal government just a day earlier.

The sole provocation for this humiliating situation: a tweet from President Trump on Wednesday morning asserting “we are absolutely moving forward” on the citizenship question,” notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision.

You read that right: a tweet. Nothing more.

Gardner had no choice but to inform the court, “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue. . . . As you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.""

And, in short order, Gardner found himself backpedaling and doing his best to defend his own credibility, pleading to the court that, “I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years through multiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Translation: I’m a career employee and not a Trump toady; I recognize that the department looks lawless and untrustworthy right now, but please try not to hold it too much against us going forward.

Career Justice Department lawyers are used to working in anonymity and with the winds of their credibility and that of the department as a whole at their backs. This is very far from the way Gardner would like to have seen his name in the national news.

Likewise for Sarah Fabian, the career lawyer forced to the front lines to draw the fire of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — and public humiliation — for defending the proposition that denying immigrants soap and toothbrushes complies with the statutory mandate of “sanitary” detention facilities.

The fault here — beyond the obvious erratic lurching of the president and his l’etat-c’est-moi disregard of the rule of law — rests with Justice Department leadership.

Administrations change positions. That is understood and legitimate. But they do it with care, circumspection and due regard for the need to respect the law as objective and continuous, and for their duty of candor to the courts.

So the true eyebrow-raising feature of the department’s abrupt U-turn on the census is its absence of deliberation. The assistant attorney general for the civil division, Jody Hunt, who joined the conference before the court, conceded that the tweet was the sole impetus for the reversal.

That demonstrates an undue, if not ridiculous, solicitude for the whims of the mad king. The indication that Trump wanted to find a way around the ruling of the Supreme Court should have been (at most) a trigger for a reasoned process involving department leadership — in particular, the solicitor general, the client (in this case, the Commerce Department) and, perhaps, the White House counsel.

And voices within those discussions needed to be ready push back against political caprice, or measure it against the government’s longer-term responsibility to safeguard its credibility with the court and display fidelity to the rule of law. That is ultimately a service to the president, as well as to the department and the courts.

Yes, time is very short, but there is no indication of any such process having taken place here. Trump tweets; the department disposes.

The backwards somersault was all the more ill-considered given the severe credibility problems that the department and administration have created in this very case. The Supreme Court’s decision took the very unusual step of essentially rejecting as pretextual the proffered reason for including the citizenship question. Even before that, Hazel had taken the unusual step of reopening the case based on new evidence suggesting that the true reason for the question was to increase the political power of Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Finally, the solicitor general had made repeated representations to the Supreme Court that June 30 was a drop-dead date after which the census question could not be added. Now that the administration seems to believe otherwise, it leaves him with egg on his face.

The department seems relatively indifferent to the institutional cost of defending the imperial presidency, including the potential erosion in public confidence that the government is constrained by law. But this latest episode is a new indication that the federal courts at least are taking notice. The 9th Circuit on Wednesday handed the administration its latest setback, rejecting its request to stay a District Court ruling blocking the diversion of military funds to pay for Trump’s border wall.

If the department continues to jump at the president’s every hiccup — candor and consistency be damned — it may find that the courts are more likely to deny it the traditional benefit of the doubt and reject its litigating positions. That is more than an embarrassment for the front-line lawyers; it is a body blow to the department’s institutional interests and, potentially, the public’s confidence in a government of laws, not of men.

Why Ocasio-Cortez's 'concentration camp' comparison still matters,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/why-ocasio-cortezs-concentration-camp-comparison-still-matters,"We’re into the third straight week of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., defending her claim that U.S. migrant detention centers are reminiscent of concentration camps, and she still doesn’t seem to understand that words, just like actions, have consequences.

She remains unapologetic, even after Holocaust survivors spoke up and asked her not to use their loss as a means for political gain. Ocasio-Cortez has claimed that by “concentration camp,” she meant the academic, historical definition and not the well-known definition identified with Nazi Germany’s death camps for Jewish people. She clearly invoked the latter, however, with the phrase “Never again,” and she even argued that Jewish members of her constituency supported her message.

We know what Ocasio-Cortez meant and, even worse, we know she doesn’t care. When presented with bipartisan condemnation, she painted herself as the victim (she's pretty good at that) and went looking for Jewish residents and historians who would back her up.

The news cycle might have left it behind, but Ocasio-Cortez’s carelessness still matters, three weeks later. We remember the Holocaust not because we want to, but because we need to. And we need to remember it because right now the memory and truth of the Holocaust is under assault from academics and politicos alike. Ocasio-Cortez’s reference cheapens its memory, whether she’ll admit it or not.

As my colleague Seth Mandel explained on Twitter, there are a few ways to make Nazi comparisons, both of which are unfortunately prevalent in our political discourse. The first is to compare a specific person, like Trump, to a Nazi. This is a common rhetorical exercise that typically goes unnoticed. The second, however, is much more alarming. It uses the victims as a comparison point, a model for what happens when a group of people are forced to endure unparalleled suffering.

Comparing Trump to Hitler insults only Trump, says Mandel. But comparing migrant detention centers — which do provide food, medical treatment, and care to fleeing migrants — to concentration camps, where millions of Jews were brutalized and killed after being ripped from their homes by the Third Reich, insults the memory of those who lost their lives at the hands of evil men, and those who carry those memories with them today.

Memory is sacred, and the heavy loss of the Holocaust remains embedded in the Jewish consciousness. to minimize this reality just to take a jab at the other party is just not worth it. Ocasio-Cortez should know better."

"Lots of DoD Small Launchers, But What Will They Launch?",https://breakingdefense.com,"['Theresa Hitchens', 'Arie Egozi', 'Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.', 'Leonardo Drs', 'Breaking Defense']",,,,https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/lots-of-dod-small-launchers-but-what-will-they-launch/,"WASHINGTON: Small satellite launcher projects are all the rage at DoD, but there aren’t many actual small satellites for them to launch. While there are numerous experimental satellites being designed and flown, there is no officially funded program aimed at designing, building and using smallsats for DoD missions.

“I think there’s been a long chicken and egg problem between small launch and small satellites” says Steve Nixon, president of the aptly-named SmallSat Alliance. “The traditional way is to attack them at the same time: do a little bit of both consecutively. We would like to see the national security side move out more aggressively, because there is lot of agreement about the value of small satellites.”

Indeed, part of the mission of the SmallSat Alliance, formed last year, is to help DoD figure out how it can “go beyond just experiments and begin to use small satellites for true operations.”

A DoD official admitted this week that right now it would be impossible to name a “program of record” for small satellites within the military services.

Part of the problem is that Air Force leadership has sent mixed signals on the level of interest in small satellites. The Air Force accounts for about 90 percent of DoD space spending.

Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson waxed decidedly noncommittal in a speech at the annual Space Symposium in April. Wilson said that an internal Pentagon study on future space architectures found that “exquisite satellites” (that is, large, expensive, and highly capable) are still a key DoD focus. (That study has not been released publicly.)

Air Force Space Command Vice Commander Lt. Gen. David Thompson, however, told a New America conference here in May that the Air Force will “definitely be using” large constellations of small satellites.

“The external and internal communication regarding [DoD] smallsat strategy is not consistent and not clear,” Carissa Christensen, CEO of Bryce Space and Technologies, said somewhat wryly in a Tuesday interview.

Experiments Everywhere

At the same time, practically every space-related body within DoD seems to be experimenting with small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) — or in Pentagonese, “proliferated LEO.”

One of the flagship programs underway is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Blackjack program, designed to test small satellite constellations based on a Lego-like model of standardized bus designs with switchable payloads. While the Air Force has been planning to transition technology proven successful from Blackjack — called CASINO for Commercially Augmented Space Inter Networked Operations — to its own LEO-based constellation of smallsats, funding for that is uncertain.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson AFB long has developed smallsat-based experiments, such as the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft studying the affects of the Van Allen radiation belts on spacecraft components. The DSX was launched last week on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, along with 24 other small satellites under Air Force Space and Missile System Center’s (SMC) Space Test Program-2 mission.

The DoD Space Test Program (STP) has been around for decades, working to orbit Army, Navy and Air Force space experiments that are chosen by the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB), chaired by the head of Air Force acquisition, Will Roper. SMC manages the STP program.

The Army, which has long been interested in the promise of small satellites for its tactical needs, has its own programs as well. The most recent effort is the Gunsmoke-L program started last year with a two-year (plus an option for a third), $8.3 million contract with Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Ala., to develop, test, integrate and demonstrate two “tactical space support vehicles.” The Army has built a series of the classified Gunsmoke satellites, dating back to at least 2017.

Further, my colleague Vivienne Machi last week broke the news that the Army is developing its first “tactical space layer” strategy that could include satellites in LEO for communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and battle management command and control (BMC2) missions.

The Navy, in November 2018, launched its ICE-Cap (Integrated Communications Extension Capability) nansosatellite to demonstrate the ability of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to expand the coverage of its Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) narrow-band communications satellite network to the polar regions.

But none of these test projects are slated to transition to formal programs, with formal budgets, and formal military missions.

Proliferating Launch Initiatives

Meanwhile, there is enormous industry buzz in the small launch vehicle market, including about the potential for DoD contracts.

Christensen said one of the reasons small launch vehicle vendors around the world are increasingly looking at governments as potential customers is that the commercial market is simply not going to be able to support all of them. Based on market history and future trends, she explained, not all the thousands of smallsats being proposed (or even already licensed) will actually be deployed; even some of the companies that manage to orbit some smallsats will fail; and once a company actually manages to become economically viable, the size of its satellites is likely to grow.

But rather than being concerned about the disconnect between DoD’s eagerness to on-ramp commercial launch capability and the lack of real DoD smallsat programs, Christensen believes DoD is doing the right thing by moving out to try to harness the capability for responsive launch. (Responsive launch, the ability to launch practically on demand, has been a Holy Grail for the Pentagon for more than a decade. See Operationally Responsive Space.)

“I really feel like this slight disconnect of market dynamics is creating a really good opportunity to take advantage of emergent systems and determine if they have applicability to future military of IC [Intelligence Community] needs, for much cheaper than starting from scratch and building internal DoD programs.”

There are at least three significant DoD programs seeking to validate smaller launchers for future military use.

STP is partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) on the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI). RALI is designed to leverage DIU’s expertise in open sourcing by rapidly awarding DoD launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.

Last week, the truly non-traditional startup SpinLaunch announced it has become the latest winner of a DIU contract under that initiative. The contract (for an unspecified amount) is to prototype SpinLaunch’s ground-based, kinetic energy launch system that functions as a kind of centrifugal force catapult to heave a small rocket carrying a satellite out of the atmosphere.

A SpinLaunch fact sheet explains that the launch system uses “existing technology and components from oil/gas/mining and wind turbine industries to construct an innovative mass acceleration system, which achieves very high launch speeds without the need for enormous power generation or massive infrastructure. After ascending above the atmosphere, a relatively small, low-cost onboard rocket will be used to “provide the final required velocity for orbital insertion.”

The RALI program’s first launch was in May, when New Zealand startup Rocket Lab successfully lofted three small experimental satellites into LEO. It included the Army’s Harbinger, a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems in Denver, to “demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.”

DARPA’s Launch Challenge in April awarded $400,000 to each of three companies chosen to demonstrate “flexible and responsive” launch of small payloads. Tucson-based Vector Launch, Virgin Orbit, and a “stealth” startup now are competing for prizes up to $10 million for proving they can successfully launch twice in a row — from any launch facility chosen by DARPA — within a short timeframe. As a next step, the competitors early next year will be asked to launch a payload to LEO within two weeks from one of eight predetermined sites — after receiving notice of the launch site only a few weeks prior, and exact details on the payload and intended orbit just days before. One of the goals is to demonstrate that DoD can contract backup launches if one of its few fixed launch facilities is put out of commission by either an accident or an attack.

Todd Master, the program manager for the DARPA Launch Challenge, told me that DARPA is busy with preparatory work in the run up to the actual launch-off planned for early next year. This includes, he says, working with the Federal Aviation Authority to ensure that the commercial licensing process is smooth, given the “challenges” the project presents to the FAA’s normal launch licensing process. “They’ve been a great partner,” he said, adding that DARPA sees the Launch Challenge as “hopefully laying the ground work for streamlined licensing processes that could work in the future” to help DoD acquire commercial space launch capabilities.

And yet another new Air Force small launch effort, called the Rapid Space Launch Initiative (RSLI), was kicked off in late May by SMC’s Rocket Systems Launch Program based at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The RSLI request for proposals says that the Air Force is “investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner. The objective is 24 hours from “call up” notification to on-orbit capability.”

That project seeks to demonstrate rapid space launch capabilities to LEO “on a small scale,” with “the intended payload” an “Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class space vehicle or smaller with a mass up to 220kg.” The RFI, however, notes that “demonstrated solutions that can scale to orbits and payloads of national security value are also of great interest. The program intends to hold an industry day in El Segundo, Calif., July 29-30."
House Democrats file lawsuit to obtain Trump tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Lauren Fox', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Clare Foran', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/tax-return-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to enforce subpoenas and obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, an escalation in a fight for the President's personal financial information.

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

DOJ wants to replace interpreters with video explaining rights at first deportation hearings: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/latino/451649-doj-wants-to-replace-immigrants-interpreters-with-video-explaining-their-rights-at,"The Justice Department is reportedly planning to end the use of in-court interpreters for undocumented immigrants appearing at their first deportation hearings, where the migrants are informed of their rights and the schedules for their trials.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that under a new plan, immigrants would instead watch videotaped instructions that explain to defendants the scope of their rights and how their proceedings will be carried out in immigration courts.

Department of Justice (DOJ) officials reportedly informed the nation's immigration judges of the change last month. The videos are prerecorded in Spanish and a number of indigenous languages, the Chronicle reports, as many of those coming north from Central America are not native Spanish speakers.

An official with the agency told the Chronicle that the plan was “part of an effort to be good stewards of [DOJ's] limited resources.”

However, the head of a union representing immigration judges, who are DOJ employees, told the Chronicle that the plan would remove an ""integral"" part of the immigration court system.

“Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost — it’s an integral part of every case,” Ashley Tabaddor said, according to the newspaper.

""If they actually look at the courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters, and reflects the flaw of having the courts run by a law enforcement agency,"" she added.

""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate?"" asked one judge, who remained anonymous in order to discuss the plan with the Chronicle.

""You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?"" the judge reportedly added, calling the decision ""a disaster in the making."""
Acting DHS chief launches probe into 'disturbing & inexcusable' Border Patrol social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-launches-probe-into-disturbing-inexcusable-border-patrol-social-media-posts,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that he has launched an “immediate investigation” into what he called “disturbing & inexcusable” social media posts from Border Patrol agents that purportedly included graphic and vulgar jokes about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan said in a statement on Twitter. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS

“I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the @USBPChief has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public’s trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. They do not represent the men and women of the Border Patrol or @DHSgov.”

The website ProPublica posted a story Monday headlined “Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.” In addition to showing indifference toward the deaths of migrants, members made vulgar jokes about Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ahead of their visit a Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, the story said.

In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a “burrito at these b-----s.” Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez blasted what she described as a “violent culture” within Border Patrol.

“They’re threatening violence on members of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?”

Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general opened its own investigation on Monday.

""Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,"" Klein said. ""CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.""

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."

""He related that his team’s investigative work is complete. They are now in the process of drafting the report. I would expect that it will be a draft that will be completed in short order,"" Ratcliffe told guest host Jason Chaffetz.

Ratcliffe said the draft report will have to be reviewed by the FBI and DOJ because about 20 percent includes classified material, according to Horowitz.

Ratcliffe was joined on the show by former Rep. Trey Gowdy, who outlined the line of questioning Republicans should pursue when former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies before House lawmakers July 17.

It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

JUST WATCHED Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP 03:55

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Many of the photos were taken before the implementation of rules meant to keep water and air free of contamination.

The images of polluted waterways are especially striking. The following Documerica photos reveal what US rivers, streams, and coastlines looked like before the EPA started regulating pollution."

Trump at his rainy July 4 event: Americans ‘part of one of the greatest stories ever told’,https://wtkr.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://wtkr.com/2019/07/04/trump-promises-show-of-a-lifetime-with-july-4th-event-though-bad-weather-looms/,"Neither heavy rain nor a raft of criticism prevented President Donald Trump from delivering his “Salute to America” to a poncho-clad crowd on the National Mall on Thursday.

“Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America. It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true. It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future,” Trump said from behind rain streaked bullet-proof glass after a flyover from the plane that normally serves as Air Force One.

In his remarks, Trump told Americans “we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told.”

“Today, just as it did 243 years ago, the future of American Freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it,” Trump said.

It was a speech heavy on history and plaudits for the military, which helped plan and execute the spectacle that Trump organized.

Severe weather and low cloud cover hung over the Washington area for much of the afternoon beforehand, leading to questions of whether the event would be canceled or curtailed.

At one point, loudspeakers at Trump’s event at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington said the program that was supposed to start at 6:30 p.m. ET “has been delayed,” but the White House later said the event would mostly start on time.

Trump’s plans were a sharp change from how the holiday has been marked in the nation’s capital by previous presidents from either party.

“It will be the show of a lifetime!” Trump declared optimistically a day before.

The spectacle was likely to delight many Americans who view the military as one remaining unifying force for pride in a country divided along political, racial and economic lines. But it’s also drawn skepticism and criticism for its costs and political hue.

The Pentagon was wary of it, however, and the city of Washington openly opposed it. And even some White House officials wondered whether a speech meant to be apolitical would stay that way — and whether crowds would materialize to watch it.

Bands heralded the branches of the military with their official march songs. M1 Abrams tanks transported by heavy rail sat on display.

There were about 750 to 800 military personnel taking part in the celebration, a defense official told CNN. And that doesn’t include the 900 hundred members of the DC National Guard who were activated to provide traffic control and security on the streets and in the subway system.

Trump was hoping for an enormous crowd, and July Fourth reliably draws plenty of people to Washington. But the last time he delivered an address on the National Mall, on Inauguration Day, he was disappointed by the turnout, or at least in the way the turnout was depicted on the news.

That left some of his aides working overtime to fill out the space along the Mall where he spoke. It wasn’t clear ahead of the event that their efforts would be successful, and some people who were offered tickets this week — including donors and administration officials — said they’d already made other plans.

Trump addressed the masses in front of Abraham Lincoln’s 19-foot marble likeness, framed by the iconic Doric columns of the 16th president’s memorial. He faced a crowd of US military families, patriotic onlookers — and ticketed VIPs, including some of his Republican allies.

It’s all a vastly scaled-up version of how presidents ordinarily celebrate July Fourth, the date American colonists officially served notice to Britain in 1776. Usually the holiday is marked with a picnic for service members and their families on the White House South Lawn, followed by a viewing of fireworks over the Washington Monument.

Presidents haven’t traditionally delivered public remarks, much less an address on the National Mall. And the day hasn’t been marked by such overtly militaristic displays.

That caused concern even among US military brass that their ranks could end up politicized, according to people familiar with the matter. In the planning for the event, Pentagon leaders had reservations about putting tanks or other armored vehicles on display, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.

As the final details come together, several top military chiefs of the individual services are not attending and instead are sending alternates, though some said they had prior plans.

The White House insisted Trump’s speech would not be political and would instead honor the military and its service to the country. But Trump has a way of turning even official events into political moments, including at military installations, often to the delight of the rank-and-file troops he’s addressing.

And even his own top aide, Kellyanne Conway, told reporters this week that the speech would highlight “the success of this administration.”

The military displays Trump ordered up — which include the flyovers, tanks and other ceremonial units such as the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, the US Army Band (“Pershing’s Own”) and the US Marine Corps Silent Drill Team — have led some to compare the event to the authoritarian parades seen in places like China or North Korea.

But Trump’s inspiration was actually a parade in France, which he witnessed with delight on Bastille Day in 2017. He immediately began formulating plans to stage a parade of his own, though cost estimates later caused him to reduce his aspirations to the speech and military pageant that will be seen Thursday.

Through it all, Trump has taken enormous interest in even the smallest details, from the staging to the military equipment on display.

It’s those details that are likely to ratchet up the costs of the event, though the massive fireworks display that will cap the evening has been donated.

Already, the National Park Service is redirecting nearly $2.5 million to help cover costs related to the July 4 extravaganza, according to The Washington Post, money that the paper says is usually “primarily intended to improve parks across the country.”

It’s not clear how much the event will cost altogether, though Trump attempted to downplay the amount on Wednesday.

“The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth,” he wrote on Twitter. “We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!”

That isn’t entirely truthful — the planes used in the flyovers came from California, Missouri, Kentucky and Florida. And the costs of the event extend well beyond the military equipment.

For example, just the “transparent ballistic armor” used to protect the President during his speech could cost more than $24,000, according to government records.

This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."

(Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Members of Congress representing many of the D.C.-based federal workers whose jobs are about to be reassigned or moved to the Midwest are running out of ways to try to stop the Trump administration from relocating those offices.

Democratic lawmakers have written a flurry of letters, bills and amendments in a race to block the measures before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, with little success.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last month finalized plans to move about 550 jobs at two scientific agencies in the Agriculture Department from Southwest Washington to the greater Kansas City region.

In a separate move, the administration has threatened to furlough and possibly lay off 150 workers at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal workforce’s human resources agency, if Congress blocks the administration’s plans to eliminate the department.

Proponents of the changes say they want to streamline operations, save taxpayer money, spread the economic effects of federal jobs beyond the nation’s capital and bring workers closer to the people they serve.

Opponents of the USDA’s move, including Democratic lawmakers and unions representing federal workers, say the agencies will hemorrhage talent because many scientists and researchers would rather quit than move their families 1,000 miles from the District.

[Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job]

Capital region lawmakers say both of the administration’s proposals are part of a long-standing Republican campaign, bolstered by President Trump, to paint federal workers as unnecessary bureaucrats.

“In the White House, there is, among some people, a real disrespect for federal employees, animated by their disrespect for the government generally,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes part of Prince George’s County, said in a brief interview. “So if you’re hostile to government, you’re then . . . hostile to those who work in government.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents most of Fairfax and Prince William counties, said an “unrelenting assault” on benefits, compensation, hiring, workers’ rights, workplace conditions and appellate rights started when Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

“The Republicans, and especially the Trump administration, view the entire federal enterprise, federal workers, as part of the swamp, and anything they can do to diminish it, demean it, from their point of view is a good thing,” Connolly said.

He pointed to a March 2017 resolution spearheaded by Republican Jason Chaffetz of Utah, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that would have deemed it unnecessary for federal agencies to be located in the District. The measure, called Divest D.C., advanced to the full House but never got a floor vote.

Current efforts appear to be moving ahead unabated, raising concerns among federal workers that the administration could try to replicate the plans across government.

“It seems like if they are successful here, this could just be the tip of the iceberg,” said Sandra Salstrom, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers. “We don’t know who’s next.”

Connolly is chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s panel on government operations, which in May held a three-hour hearing titled “The Administration’s War on a Merit Based Civil Service.”

The hearing focused on the administration’s plans to move most Office of Personnel Management functions into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. The plan also would shift leadership to the executive branch, raising worries that the agency could become politicized.

The OPM-GSA merger was the subject of a rally last week organized by federal worker unions across from the current OPM headquarters.

In addition to Connolly and Hoyer, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate, took turns at the microphone in the shadow of a statue of Argentine independence hero José de San Martín.

Plans to move the USDA agencies — the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science — to Kansas City intensified Democrats’ frustration.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) of Montgomery County has tried to stop the USDA move through a bill and an amendment, and he sits on a committee that could block the leases on new office space if the contracts exceed a certain threshold.

He suggested the move was part of an ongoing effort by the administration to suppress scientific data on climate change.

“I will use every tool I have on both the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee to block this move,” he said in a statement.

The USDA Office of Inspector General began a review of the relocation in November at the request of Norton and Hoyer. The report is under review by the agency before its release to Congress and the public.

Kevin Hunt, a geographer and head of his union bargaining unit at the Economic Research Service, is a Missouri native but does not plan to move.

He said he is sad to leave what he considers a “dream job” that allows him to do research and publish in scientific journals, pays well and has promotion potential. His partner has a good job elsewhere, making it difficult to move.

Hunt said he believes the agency belongs in the District, where collaboration with other agencies is seamless.

“It’s not about Kansas City,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s about moving people who are established here and who are at the top of their game.”

Lawmakers have inserted language into multiple appropriations bills to block the administration from spending money to move workers in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

However, the changes are on track to begin before the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, which prompted Norton to suggest litigation as a next step. The basis for a legal challenge is unclear.

“I’ve got to be absolutely candid with you,” she told workers at the rally. “I am going to ask you to go into court. . . . I’m standing here this afternoon to say, ‘If we don’t beat them, I am sure that you will beat them. Keep fighting. We are there with you!’”

She added in an interview: “I think we have done everything we can do. We’re racing against the clock.”

Asked about litigation, an AFGE spokesman said they are pursuing collective bargaining to block or delay the moves.

Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

Trump administration not adding citizenship question to census,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Kathryn Watson', 'Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/citizenship-census-question-trump-administration-not-adding-question-to-census-doj-tells-aclu/,"The Trump administration has begun printing the 2020 census without including a question about citizenship status, seemingly bringing an end to a contentious legal battle that reached the highest court in the land.

In an email obtained by CBS News to attorneys who have been leading the court fight, a lawyer from the Justice Department wrote that ""the decision has been made"" to print the census without the question and that printing had already begun. The Justice Department confirmed the move later Tuesday afternoon, as did the Commerce Department.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also said the Census Bureau's focus is assuring a ""complete and accurate census.""

""I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census,"" Ross said in a statement. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.""

Last week, the Supreme Court ruled the administration couldn't add the proposed citizenship question because its explanation for doing so was insufficient. Opponents of the question had argued its inclusion would lead to the undercounting of certain demographic groups.

The administration had an opportunity to go back to the drawing board to revise its handling of the situation, but it would have been racing against the clock to do so before the forms needed to be printed.

President Trump had threatened to delay the census, a move that would have immediately run into additional legal obstacles. The Constitution stipulates that the census be taken every 10 years.

""Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020,"" Mr. Trump tweeted after last week's ruling.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he was ""encouraged"" over the administration's decision. Cummings is still waiting for documents from the Trump administration over its plans to add the controversial question.

""I am encouraged that administration officials dropped President Trump's unconstitutional plan to postpone the census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings wrote. ""The Trump administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext. Now they need to direct all their attention to the nuts and bolts of putting on the census next year. The Census Bureau has a responsibility under the Constitution to get an accurate count.""

""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis,"" Cummings added.

EPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451618-epa-moving-ahead-with-plan-to-phase-out-animal-testing-report,"The Intercept reported Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to push ahead with a plan to phase out animal lab testing, which is raising concerns among some public health and environmental advocates who say the testing is needed to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals.

EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report EPA's backward accounting protects polluters, not the people Overnight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project MORE signaled the agency will slash funding on experiments tested on mammals in half by 2025 and look to stop using mammal studies for the approval of new chemicals by 2035, in an internal department memo reviewed by The Intercept.

The EPA, however, is denying The Intercept's report that it is looking to phase out animal testing, calling it inaccurate. It did acknowledge it is seeking to reduce and replace animal testing requirements.

""Though, EPA does look to announce sometime soon agency goals to reduce the number of animals impacted by EPA testing. Human health will be fully protected under any final EPA policy goal to reduce reliance on animal testing,"" an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""EPA can protect human health and simultaneously reduce, replace, and refine animal testing requirements.""

According to The Intercept, the EPA is looking to use alternative methods to animal testing, such as computer modeling and tests on cells, to measure chemical toxicity.

However, scientists warn that the alternatives are not yet able to replicate mammal studies for regulation — which many say is the reason the federal agency is looking to make the policy change, The Intercept reports.

""EPA is well aware that these cells don’t replicate human metabolism. So when it comes to bioactivation, they’re going to miss all that — and they know that,"" Thomas Zoeller, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the health effects of man-made chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls, told The Intercept."
Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

Trump tweet breaks Interior Department webpage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-tweet-breaks-interior-department-webpage,"A tweet from President Trump’s account generated so much web traffic to the Department of Interior’s press release regarding Fourth of July celebrations that it broke the webpage.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."
Justice Department's internal watchdog reviewing decision to halt FBI headquarters plan,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/451508-doj-watchdog-reviewing-decision-to-halt-fbi-headquarters-plan,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general is launching an inquiry into the FBI’s involvement in the Trump administration's decision to halt plans to move the bureau’s headquarters to a suburban location outside Washington, D.C.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz told House lawmakers in a letter dated Tuesday that his office is “initiating a review that will assess the DOJ’s and FBI’s planning for a future FBI Headquarters facility,” including their assessment of and consideration of a plan to move the headquarters outside the nation's capital.

The issue has come under scrutiny from congressional Democrats after revelations about President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump considering executive order on citizenship question for Census US women's soccer star Alex Morgan says verdict on Trump White House invite will be team decision China renews demands that US lift all tariffs for trade deal MORE’s involvement in the relocation plans.

The administration scrapped plans dating back almost 10 years to relocate FBI headquarters to a suburban location in favor of rebuilding at the agency's current location, which is across the street from Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington.

Democrats have suggested Trump may have gotten involved in the plans to prevent a commercial development from replacing the FBI’s J. Edgar Hoover building.

“For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions,” four House Democratic chairmen said in a statement Wednesday. “We welcome the IG’s independent examination, which will supplement our ongoing effort to get to the truth.”

The inspector general’s review is likely to produce more information about the administration’s abrupt reversal of the plans. The General Services Administration (GSA) and FBI had been working for years on efforts to build new headquarters in neighboring Maryland or Virginia, but they reversed course in 2017 to pursue rebuilding at the current location.

Administration officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, have told Congress that it was the FBI’s preference to construct a new building at the current location.

A GSA inspector general report issued in August showed that Wray and other officials met with Trump at least once about the headquarters proposal. It also projected the proposed rebuild could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than moving forward with the long-term relocation plan.

Horowitz wrote in the letter Tuesday that his review “will include an examination of DOJ’s and the FBI’s progress in its planning, their assessment and consideration of the previously proposed plan to move FBI Headquarters to a suburban location, and their assessment and consideration of the plan to demolish the J. Edgar Hoover Building and construct a new facility on that site.”

The administration’s latest fiscal 2020 budget proposal requested no new money for the FBI headquarters project, with a Justice Department official telling reporters in March that the project is “still under discussion” within the administration."
Former Air Force One steward reflects on his time serving five presidents,https://www.naplesnews.com,"['Lisa Conley', 'Published P.M.

Franklin, 73, grew up on Long Island, New York, and spent his summers on nearby Fire Island working at the illustrious Talisman Yacht Club, home to the jet set of the 1960s. There he learned the ins and outs of the food and beverage service industry and how to interact with the rich and famous, including Marilyn Monroe, who rented a house just a few doors down from Franklin.

Franklin didn't know it, but his experience on Fire Island and at the yacht club helped prepare him to later serve some of the most powerful men in the world.

Franklin was drafted for the Vietnam War shortly after graduating high school and decided to join the Air Force because ""it was the only branch of the military where the enlisted men weren't the primary resource being shot — instead they went for the officers,"" he said.

Franklin — who currently serves as the director of Cape Fear Regional Jetport, North Carolina's fourth busiest airport — shared his stories Wednesday at the Naples Airport Authority's 50th anniversary party.

His first assignment was working in a mess hall near missile bases in South Dakota. Franklin then became a member of an in-flight B-52 kitchen crew based in Guam and eventually made his way to Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., as a member of the 89th Airlift Wing, the unit that operates Air Force One.

When Franklin was promoted to the crew of Air Force One in 1976, it was toward the end of Gerald Ford's administration, and he was told he might not have a job in six months when a new president took office.

However, not only did Franklin serve Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, he remained on the flight crew during the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, making Franklin the first and only Air Force One flight attendant to serve five consecutive presidents.

""I was in the right place at the right time and I was capable, mentally and physically, of doing what they needed me to do,"" he said.

One of Franklin's major responsibilities was planning and grocery shopping for all of the meals served aboard Air Force One. It was a job that was part-culinary, part-security because it was up to him to ensure that none of the food was poisoned.

""The flight attendants would shop in civilian clothes because we didn't want anybody to know who we were, and we would never go to the same store,"" Franklin said. ""Our primary responsibility was not only to give good service, but to make sure the food and anything on that airplane — drinks, snacks, candy, mouthwash, toothpaste, whatever — had not been tampered with.""

Franklin served on Air Force One for a total of 18 years. He got to know everything about the presidents, from their favorite food (there was always a fresh jar of jelly beans for Reagan, and Bush had an affinity for pork rinds) to their preferred type of music (country for all except Clinton, who was ""a rock 'n roll guy""), Franklin said.

""Presidents are just like us; they cry, they feel, they hurt,"" he said. ""They get up in the morning, put their pants on in the morning and go to work.""

Sometimes, though, they need a little help getting up. Franklin recalled one trip when he had to wake up President Clinton after just two and a half hours of sleep. He tried to wake the president gently, but after a while he said bluntly, ""Sir, it's time to get your butt out of bed and go to work,"" Franklin said.

""He's the only guy I would have said that to,"" Franklin said with a laugh. ""Hillary thought it was hilarious and started laughing, so I turned to her and said, 'What are you laughing at? You're next!'""

The stories enthralled guests at the airport party.

Christopher Rozansky, Naples Airport Authority executive director, said the anniversary is a historic milestone for the airport, which is updating its master plan for the first time in 20 years.

""So often we focus on the work that needs to be done that we don't take the time to reflect on where we've come from or the accomplishments we've achieved,"" Rozansky said.

Some of those accomplishments include ushering in 150,000 visitors each year and boasting an economic impact of $440.1 million, according to a Florida Department of Transportation report released this year.

Rozansky said the Airport Authority plans on celebrating its 50th anniversary with events throughout the rest of the year, including an appreciation party for airport customers and an inaugural 5K on the runway Oct. 5 to benefit the Experimental Aircraft Association's youth program.

""Our mission is to connect people in Naples,"" he said, ""and as more and more people move to Southwest Florida, that mission is more important than ever.""

"In wake of Tomah opioid scandal, VA system has undergone culture change, secretary says",https://www.jsonline.com,"['Marisa Peryer', 'Published P.M. Ct July']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2019/07/01/wake-tomah-opioid-scandal-va-embracing-alternative-pain-therapy/1617663001/,"CLOSE

A scandal that engulfed the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center has forced a culture change — not just at the western Wisconsin hospital but at VA centers nationwide.

That's the message VA Secretary Robert Wilkie brought with him to Wisconsin on Monday as he met with state VA officials.

In a sit-down interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wilkie did not shy away from discussing the ""terrible things"" that happened at the Tomah center.

First reported in 2015 — and confirmed in a 2016 investigation by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs — the Tomah VA chief of staff, David Houlihan, overprescribed opioids to veterans so much that he was nicknamed ""the candy man."" Further, the center was infested with a culture of intimidation that punished anyone questioning the practices.

Ultimately, top officials at the center were ousted and Houlihan agreed to surrender his medical license.

Wilkie, who became secretary 11 months ago, said Tomah had become the epicenter of an opioid problem that gripped the entire VA system. He said the system has now undergone a culture shift to prevent further opioid abuse — a shift that is continuing to evolve.

""What Tomah forced VA to do was to rethink old ways of doing things and pay more attention to signs of distress and calls for help from those who use VA,"" Wilkie said.

Specifically, doctors more frequently are prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers and encouraging patients to pursue alternative therapies such as acupuncture or music therapy to address pain.

The VA has been a nationwide leader in pursuing alternative pain therapies, Wilkie said, and opioid prescription rates at VA hospitals have dropped by about 50% in the past year as a result.

While opioids ""numb the brain"" to painful sensations, over-the-counter analgesics treat pain at its source. For this reason, Wilkie said, the over-the-counter options are ""more effective at treating pain than opioids"" and also curb patient exposure to the highly addictive substances.

Thousands of veterans are onboard with the idea of using alternative therapies, he said. Wilkie recalled visiting Hawaii last December when he saw 10 or 11 Vietnam veterans moving their shoulders and knees to music during a session.

""My father was a very decorated combat soldier from Vietnam, and I've been stunned by the acceptance by that generation — a generation that is not very amenable to new ways of thinking when it comes to health or pain management,"" Wilkie said.

While visiting Wisconsin, the secretary planned to visit Tomah with U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who Wilkie said worked to implement new VA policies following the opioid scandal.

""Tomah forced VA — through work that (Sen. Baldwin) did to rethink how we handle pain as an institution,"" he said.

Victoria Brahm, who became acting director of the Tomah center in the wake of the scandal and director in early 2017, joined Wilkie on Monday. She said the culture change Wilkie spoke of has been part of her agenda since she assumed leadership.

Most of her first year in the role, she said, ""was dedicated to setting a foundation, cleaning up policies, streamlining committees, trying to do only things that were value-added, setting a vision, who really are we and what is the business we should be in.""

The 246-bed hospital sits on a 175-acre main campus, with four outpatient clinics that serve thousands of veterans from 15 counties in Wisconsin and two in Minnesota.

States sue EPA for tougher regulation of asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451189-states-sue-epa-for-tougher-regulation-of-asbestos,"Eleven Democratic attorneys general from across the country have filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arguing the agency has failed to effectively regulate asbestos.

The agency announced a rule in April to restrict the substance but stopped short of banning it outright, a move critics say could open the door to new uses of asbestos.

The attorneys general had previously petitioned the EPA to create a new rule requiring data collection on the importation and use of asbestos, something the agency denied around the time in unveiled its new rule. The suit would force the agency to issue a new asbestos reporting rule.

Officials have known for decades that asbestos causes illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis. The EPA’s April rule was the first action the agency took on the substance in 30 years, but it was panned by critics as a half measure that could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

“This new rule makes it more difficult for industry to resume some abandoned uses of asbestos, but that is a half step at best,” Melanie Benesh, legislative attorney at the Environmental Working Group, wrote in a press release at the time. An outright ban “is the only way the public can trust industry will never again be able to use this dangerous material that has literally killed tens of thousands of Americans.”

The EPA has not ruled out an asbestos ban under its new rule.

“If there is any unreasonable risk, the EPA will regulate, and our regulation could take the form of a ban,” Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention told The Hill in April.

But many Democrats say they’ve lost patience with the agency, expressing concern that agency scientists who recommended a full ban were ignored by top EPA officials. In May, House Democrats held a hearing on a bill that would force the agency to do so.

In addition to California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia are parties in the suit."
