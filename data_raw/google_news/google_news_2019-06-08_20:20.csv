"Trump Mixes Economic and National Security, Plunging the U.S. into Multiple Fights",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Paul Mozur']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/business/trump-economy-national-security.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is increasingly blurring the line between America’s national and economic security, enabling him to harness powerful tools meant to punish the world’s worst global actors and redirect them at nearly every trading partner, including Mexico, Japan, China and Europe.

Over a few weeks, Mr. Trump has declared European and Japanese cars, Chinese telecom equipment and Mexican immigrants national security threats. Those declarations have given the president authority to use Cold War powers to inflict economic pain on countries through tariffs, government blacklists and other restrictions.

While previous administrations tried to deal with economic and security threats separately, Mr. Trump has deliberately mixed the two, viewing another country’s trade practices as dangerous to the United States as its military abilities.

It is a view he has espoused since the 2016 campaign trail, where he pushed his “America First” agenda and vowed to protect companies that he believed were on the losing end of global trade. Once in office, Mr. Trump immediately pulled the United States out of the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership and initiated investigations into imported goods, like washing machines and solar panels, that he believed were flooding the American market."

""Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy,"" Pelosi said in a statement Saturday, a day after the President announced he'd rescinded tariff threats to Mexico after reaching an immigration enforcement deal

Trump took a shot at Pelosi as well Saturday morning, calling her ""nervous"" on Twitter as he pressed the House to take up the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- one of several ongoing points of dispute between Trump and Pelosi.

""Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions!"" Trump tweeted.

"CNN panel knocks Trump's Mexico deal, suggest it's a distraction from weak US job numbers",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-panel-knocks-trumps-deal-with-mexico-suggest-its-to-distract-from-low-jobs-numbers,"A CNN panel had a pretty pessimistic view of the U.S.-Mexico deal President Trump announced Friday in hopes of ending the migration crisis.

Late Friday, Trump tweeted that threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexico were being ""indefinitely suspended"" because Mexico had agreed to help slow the flow of migrants heading toward the U.S. border.

CNN'S DON LEMON LAMENTS TRUMP-ERA 'TOXICITY' AND TROLLS, SAYS HE MAY MOVE ON: REPORTS

But some folks on the liberal news network were not impressed.

Former Republican U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent called the negotiations ""bluster"" and insisted that Trump never would have gone through with his tariff threat because it would have hurt border states like Texas, where he noted that Democrat Joe Biden was leading Trump in a new poll on the 2020 presidential race.

CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser also panned the Trump deal.

""We're all sort of props in this fake game of, you know, 'Let's Stick Up The Neighbors',"" she said. ""To me, it's such a predictable play here because we've seen President Trump run it so many times before.

""At the beginning of the week,"" she added, ""how many people in Washington thought this is exactly where we would be on Friday night?""

""I think everybody did,"" CNN anchor Don Lemon responded.

Glasser went on to say Trump ""failed completely"" to control the border and slammed the ""lack of normal policy process"" leading up to the deal, calling the whole thing ""theater.""

CNN contributor and former Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio insisted this was no ""art of the deal.""

""He created this drama on Monday or Tuesday,"" D'Antonio said, ""and I swear they must have locked up the Mexican delegation in the State Department to keep them there for nine or ten hours and then fed them well and they all had a laugh and they let them out and they said, 'Well, the problem is solved.'

""Well, there was no problem the beginning of the week to solve that was extraordinary,"" he added, ""and now we just have this solution that nobody understands and that won't produce what the president actually promised, which was a big, beautiful wall that Mexico would pay for.""

""Is this all about reelection?"" Lemon asked.

""Of course it is,"" D'Antonio answered.

Lemon then invoked the nation's job numbers for May, which fell below expectations, and questioned if Trump's deal had anything to do with the weak stats.

""Do you think that may have weighed in on the president's decision to make a deal, maybe any deal here?"" Lemon asked the Never-Trump Republican.

""I do,"" Dent responded. ""The jobs report was clearly not what anybody wanted."""

Mnuchin says Trump still has authority to impose tariffs if Mexico does not abide by immigration deal,https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/08/mnuchin-trump-can-still-impose-tariffs-if-mexico-does-not-abide-by-deal.html,"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Saturday that President Donald Trump still has the authority to impose tariffs on Mexico if it does not live up to the terms of a deal to strengthen immigration enforcement and stem the migration of people from Central America to the U.S. southern border.



Mnuchin, speaking in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the G-20 finance ministers meeting in Japan, said the immigration deal struck last night between the two countries had met Trump's objectives in addressing the issue of Central American migration.



Mnuchin warned, however, that Trump could still impose tariffs if the administration determines that Mexico is not abiding by the deal.



""Our expectation is that Mexico will do what they've committed to do and our expectation is that we won't need to put tariffs in place, but obviously if that's not the case, the president retains that authority,"" Mnuchin told Reuters.

Trump announced Friday evening that the U.S would ""indefinitely"" suspend planned tariffs against Mexico, which were scheduled to go into effect on Monday. In return, Mexico agreed to deploy its national guard to crack down on Central American migrants travelling through the country on their way to the U.S. southern border.



The Mexican government also agreed to take back migrants who had crossed the U.S. southern border to claim asylum. Those migrants would remain in Mexico until the U.S. makes a decision on their asylum claims.



Last month, Trump abruptly threatened to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if the Mexican government did not do more to stop migration from Central America. Those tariffs would increase to 25% over the course of several months if Mexico did not meet White House demands.



The threatened tariffs shook markets, which were already facing uncertainty from the escalating U.S.-China trade war, and provoked opposition from across the political spectrum.



Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposed slapping Mexico with tariffs, a source told CNBC. Immigration hawk Stephen Miller had pushed the idea on Trump, who had grown frustrated after listening to conservative radio commentary on a surge in border crossings.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was also considering its legal options, and a source told CNBC that business groups were considering suing the administration. Senate Republicans largely opposed the president's plan."
China Summons Tech Giants to Warn Against Cooperating With Trump Ban,https://www.nytimes.com,['Kate Conger'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/business/economy/china-huawei-trump.html,"The meetings this week were led by China’s central economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, and attended by representatives from its Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, who addressed their remarks to a broad range of companies that export goods to China, according to the two people familiar with the gatherings.

The involvement of three government bodies suggested a high level of coordination and likely approval from the very top of China’s opaque leadership structure. The intervention seemed designed to rally support for Huawei, though the company was not specifically mentioned, the two people said.

“There is a strong perception in Beijing that the U.S. government is intent on blunting China’s technology rise, and that if this process is not slowed or stopped, the future of China’s entire digital economy is at risk,” said Paul Triolo, the head of geotechnology at the consultancy Eurasia Group, adding that the spat had major political implications for Xi Jinping, China’s president and the head of its ruling Communist Party.

“Mr. Xi and the party will be seen as unable to defend China’s economic future” if the confrontation with the United States does major damage to Huawei and throws off China’s rollout of the next generation of wireless technology, called 5G, Mr. Triolo added.

More broadly, the warnings also seemed to be an attempt to forestall a fast breakup of the sophisticated supply chains that connect China’s economy to the rest of the world. Production of a vast array of electronic components and chemicals, along with the assembly of electronic products, makes the country a cornerstone of the operations of many of the world’s largest multinational companies.

As the trade relationship between the United States and China has broken down, fears have risen in China that major companies will seek to move production elsewhere to avoid longer-term risks. In the meetings this week, Chinese officials explicitly warned companies that any move to pull production from China that seemed to go beyond standard diversification for security purposes could lead to punishment, according to the two people.

The Chinese officials appeared to have differing messages for the companies, depending on whether they were American or not, the people added."

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."
Congress Clashes With Justice Department Over Its Decisions Not To Defend Laws,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730722220/congress-clashes-with-justice-department-over-its-decisions-not-to-defend-laws,"Congress Clashes With Justice Department Over Its Decisions Not To Defend Laws

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""

FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U.S.-Mexico immigration deal met President Donald Trump’s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U.S. border, but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it.

The deal averts a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods that was due to start on Monday, with Mexico agreeing to rapidly expand a controversial asylum program and deploy security forces to stem the flow of illegal Central American migrants.

“We now have an agreement that we believe is going to fix the immigration issue. And that was extremely important to the president,” Mnuchin told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a G20 finance meeting in Fukuoka, Japan.

Mnuchin, who said he participated in a call with Trump just before the deal was announced, said the president would retain the right to impose tariffs if Mexico did not keep its commitments.

“Our expectation is that Mexico will do what they’ve committed to do and our expectation is that we won’t need to put tariffs in place, but obviously if that’s not the case, the president retains that authority.”"

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN

Fox News has learned that Durham has been getting briefed on the “four corners” of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues. Barr appointed Durham, 68, last month.

News of Durham's high level of engagement in the probe comes days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation.

""In fact probably have more questions, and some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened,"" Barr told CBS News in an interview.

Durham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News is told Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.

During the CBS interview, Barr revealed Durham picked up the FISA and surveillance components from Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber, whose work was put on hold pending DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's findings from his ongoing review. Huber, Barr said, “was essentially on standby” in case Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.”

Horowitz's investigation is expected to be completed shortly.

Before the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to “tee up” potential targets for future investigation.

They pointed in particular to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.

Simpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr’s records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.

Last month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr’s wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows' referral stated.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony."""
VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."
Trump enjoys playing the role of the American president — but he will never stop being Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'June At Pm']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-enjoys-playing-the-role-of-the-american-president--but-will-never-stop-being-trump/2019/06/07/ed486210-8938-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html,"President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump react during a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, on June 6. (Christian Hartmann/Reuters)

The American and French flags, their twinned red, white and blue rustling in the light breeze. The crystalline sky and the fresh shorn grass. And the small white gravestones — markers for the nearly 10,000 Americans who lost their lives in the D-Day invasion — stretching on endlessly toward the horizon.

The backdrop of the hallowed Normandy cemetery was a postcard tableau for the well-received speech President Trump was about to deliver on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, in which he extolled honor, self-sacrifice and those heroes who “placed themselves into the palm of God’s hand.”

But first, the president had a few things he wanted to share with Fox News.

Just moments before the historic celebration Thursday, Trump sat for an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham and, with little prompting, railed against his enemies, real and perceived.

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, he said, was a “fool.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) he blasted as “a disgrace” — “a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.” And Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) he dismissed as a crying disaster, as a “total political, you know, jerk.”

Trump’s five-day trip to Europe revealed again how Trump enjoys playing the role of the American president — but will never stop being Trump.

His staff often tries to rein him in, choreographing his days with an alchemic mix of structure and downtime, or presenting him with teleprompter speeches to deliver. But ultimately, Trump himself dictates his own conduct — choosing when to unleash pre-dawn Twitter tirades or squeeze himself into a tailcoat as tradition requires.

“If he felt slightly out of place at Buckingham Palace or on the world stage, you revert to the familiar,” said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian, noting that while George W. Bush famously traveled the world with his feather pillow in tow, Trump instead brings his phone — and its Twitter app.

Meacham added that while previous presidents often traveled abroad to escape domestic controversies and elevate themselves as global players, Trump seems to tote the morass overseas, as if tucked into his carry-on next to the toiletries.

“What’s so predictable and self-defeating about Trump is that instead of using the world stage to escape domestic political strife, this for him is just another arena in which to be on Fox News,” Meacham said. “You’re not making peace and commemorating our dead. You’re making points and bestowing nicknames.”

Trump has long existed in a split-screen presidency — the duties of the job juxtaposed with a shattering of norms. But in Europe, as he hopped between Britain, Ireland and France, the president seemed to enter something of a montage, perhaps set to the “Looney Tunes” theme song.

Yes, he attended a Buckingham Palace state banquet, wearing a white tie, dining on new season Windsor lamb and strawberry sable with lemon verbena cream. In Portsmouth, England, he read the prayer President Franklin D. Roosevelt shared on the eve of the invasion, and a day later, in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, he spoke movingly of how “our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle, tested in the trials of war and proven in the blessings of peace.” He even greeted schoolchildren at his private golf resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, in a visit that was apparently controversy-free.

Abbi Shanahn, 16, one of three Irish siblings who met the president, described the experience as “mad, so surreal.”

Yet, on the same trip, Trump also attacked London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Twitter as “a stone cold loser” before even touching down in the country; late-night tweeted that performer Bette Midler was a “washed up psycho”; threatened the United Kingdom’s beloved National Health Service in trade negotiations before reversing himself; and, of course, attacked his political rivals in the shadow of Normandy cemetery.

Trump’s interview with Ingraham is hardly the first time he has issued controversial statements in incongruous settings. On his first full day in office, the president visited CIA headquarters and stood before its wall of stars — honoring intelligence officers who died in the line of duty — to blast the media for its coverage of his inauguration’s crowd size.

He delivered a rollicking stemwinder at the Boy Scout Jamboree, where he dropped the word “hell” and veered dangerously close to sharing the story of a wealthy friend who bought a yacht and led “a very interesting life” that was decidedly not rated PG. More recently, Trump attacked the late senator John McCain at a General Dynamics tank factory in Ohio before a largely military crowd.

On Friday, as he was heading home, Trump went after Pelosi on Twitter, unhappy that the Speaker told Democrats behind closed doors that she preferred to see Trump “in prison” rather than impeached.

“Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement, especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas,” he wrote.

What Trump seemed to ignore was that, just the previous day, he too was launching domestic attacks on foreign soil, disparaging Pelosi in personal terms during his interview with Ingraham.

Pelosi sat just a few hundred yards away at the same ceremony, waiting for the D-Day program to begin.

"DOJ official Bruce Ohr awarded $28G bonus amid Russia probe, records indicate",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-official-bruce-ohr-awarded-28k-bonus-amid-russia-probe-records-indicate,"Bruce Ohr, the Justice Department official whose connection to the opposition research firm responsible for the anti-Trump “dossier” led to his eventual demotion, was awarded a $28,000 performance bonus while the Russia probe was ongoing, according to newly released DOJ documents.

The records do not indicate why Ohr was given the bonus in November 2016, though they show he also received a $14,520 bonus a year earlier, totaling $42,520 over a two-year period.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."
"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."
Treasury targets Iran's most profitable oil refiners with new sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/treasury-targets-irans-most-profitable-oil-refiners-with-new-sanctions,"The Treasury Department imposed broad sanctions Friday on Iran's petrochemical and refinery industry for contributing funds to the financial arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department recently named a terrorist organization.

The sanctions target Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding group, called the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company, which maintains dozens of companies and subsidiaries.

“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines"" to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed the sanctions on the holding company's 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based marketing firms.

The Treasury charges the petrochemical refiners with providing financial support to Khatam al-Anbiya, the Revolutionary Guard's engineering conglomerate, which the U.S. government refers to as the ""economic arm"" of the group.

“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.

The Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and its group of subsidiaries represent 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production and 50% of Iran’s total petrochemical exports, according to the Treasury Department."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."
A Short History of Presidential Vacillation: Mars or the Moon,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Haley Weiss'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/trump-moon-part-of-mars/591319/,"Read: Why Trump wants to go to the moon so badly

The backtracking implied by Trump’s tweet carries enormous weight for a government agency that’s all too familiar with the bait and switch of being redirected halfway through a project. NASA has a long legacy of being hampered by presidential turnovers, which can hinder any worthwhile, groundbreaking project from making it to fruition. NASA’s most important accomplishments have spanned presidencies and required agreement across administrations. Barack Obama spent his time in office pushing for a decades-away Mars mission—exactly what it appears Trump, who cut Obama’s plans off at the pass with his moon-and-militia fixation, now wants.

Since it was established by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958, NASA has had to weather the blows of presidential whims time and time again: Trump’s swing from Mars to the moon and back again is only the latest iteration of an ongoing pattern.

John F. Kennedy: Mars—No, Wait, the Moon

Before John F. Kennedy wanted to go to the moon, he wanted to land on Mars. But NASA’s associate administrator, Robert Seamans Jr., insisted that the moon was a more achievable goal, and warned Kennedy against laying out a plan destined to fail. It was during the Kennedy administration that the idea of the moon as a necessary step to human arrival on Mars first emerged, but ultimately the moon was promoted to the more realistic destination of choice.

Kennedy’s famous call for lunar ascendancy drove NASA’s feverish agenda in its early years. In 1961, when work on the Apollo program began, NASA’s budget was increased by 89 percent. Getting to the moon was of unwavering political importance.

Lyndon B. Johnson: The Moon

During his years as Senate majority leader, Johnson had helped spur the creation of NASA by putting pressure on President Eisenhower to respond to Russian space activity. He continued to nurture the Apollo program throughout his presidency, but the attention and money diverted toward the Vietnam War meant that little planning was done for any continued space exploration. The moon landing, scheduled for the end of the decade, was still the goal.

Richard Nixon: The Moon (We Made It!)

Nixon presided over the celebrated 1969 moon landing, but his attitude toward the rest of the cosmos remained reserved and flatly unambitious. NASA wanted to launch a 20-year Mars mission; the president refused to discuss the possibility.

Gerald Ford: Earth Orbit Only

During Ford’s three-year tenure, a U.S. Apollo module docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft during the 1975 “handshake in space”—part of the Russian-American Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Ford, a longtime NASA supporter, continued to develop the Space Shuttle program, which aimed only to reach Earth orbit. He made no public plans for a return trip to the moon or anywhere beyond. One lunar landing was enough."

"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

Five ways Google could be vulnerable to a Justice Department probe,https://www.theverge.com,['Jun'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18650489/google-justice-department-antitrust-investigation-monopoly-claims,"On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators from the Department of Justice will examine “Google’s business practices related to its search and other businesses.” It’s one of the biggest threats Google has ever faced from US regulators, but so far, we don’t know much about the case itself. The Journal’s description was open-ended, and the nature of Google’s business makes it vulnerable to antitrust challenges from a number of different directions. Google dominates the search market, but it also holds nearly 40 percent of the digital advertising market, and Android is the world’s most popular operating system. In all of these markets, critics have claimed that Google is simply too big, and it’s faced billion-dollar fines over each of them in Europe.

The probe is supposedly in its early stages, and it’s not clear what the Justice Department might consider worth investigating. But the earlier EU fines, along with a 2013 Federal Trade Commission investigation, offer some guidance. We’ve broken down some of the major monopoly allegations against Google as well as how courts and regulators have treated them so far — from search engine rankings to Android app bundling. (Google, perhaps understandably, did not respond to a request for comment.)

Google has monopolized ad placement

Google is the biggest single player in online advertising: one forecast puts its market share at 37.2 percent in 2019, compared to around 22.1 percent for its closest rival, Facebook. It makes money on two fronts: advertisers can buy ad space through a Google exchange, and websites can serve Google ads through the AdSense program. It’s been accused of abusing its power on both sides of the transaction, which is something Google denies.

The European Commission has specifically investigated Google’s relationship with web publishers. In March, it found that Google had unfairly banned AdSense customers from placing other search engines and ad boxes on their sites. (Google phased out this clause, but it retained the right to “premium” ad space on websites until 2016.) Publishers had fewer options for selling their ad space as a result, potentially driving down their revenue. At the same time, anyone using Google’s ad placement service was also pushed toward using the search engine exclusively, making it harder for competitors like Bing to get off the ground. The EC court fined Google €1.49 billion, saying it had “cemented its dominance” through illegal means. “Google’s conduct harmed competition and consumers,” the court said, “and stifled innovation.”

The FTC also examined this policy, and although it cleared Google in 2013, investigators privately expressed serious concerns about the practice. Bloomberg has noted that AdSense is a declining part of Google’s business, and the company has changed its policies to avert some of the key complaints. But the Justice Department could still decide that these exclusivity deals helped Google — unfairly — reach its current level of power.

Google has monopolized ad sales

Antitrust watchdogs aren’t just worried about how Google places ads on websites; they’re worried about how it sells that ad space. Google historically auctioned off space in a way that favored its AdX marketplace. When publishers and ad tech companies tried to get around that with something called header bidding, Google pushed back with a centralized system that would still give Google’s own exchange a potential advantage.

US and EU regulators approved Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick — which helped Google establish its ad empire — in 2008. Since then, they’ve focused their critiques on things like exclusivity deals. And Google could argue that it’s not hurting consumers or treating other exchanges unfairly. Header bidding can make pages load more slowly, so discouraging it could help web users. Google has dropped policies like the “last look” advantage, which let Google one-up other bids. Amazon has also started chipping away at Google and Facebook’s advertising market share, so it could also say there’s more competition.

Even so, “the fact that Google is able to dominate the advertising market is quite dangerous,” says Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly advocacy group Open Markets Institute. It gives Google power over how people can make money online — and, by extension, what kind of content people see when they browse the web.

Google downranks its competitors in search

But for ordinary users, ad tech might still seem a bit abstract, and there’s a much more visible controversy brewing with Google search.

Google uses search to highlight other Google services, including its business review and shopping platforms. More worryingly, it’s also demoted search results from competing companies. The UK-based comparison shopping platform Foundem claims that Google buried its site while promoting Google Shopping, for instance. EU regulators agreed that the company had overstepped, fining Google €2.4 billion.

Restaurant recommendation site Yelp has also complained about Google’s special search cards, which appear on top of its normal results. (Both of these allegations are unrelated to President Donald Trump’s conspiratorial claims of political “search bias.”) “There’s a lot of great evidence out there showing that Google sort of undertook a strategy to keep its competitors at bay,” says Yelp public policy director Luther Lowe.

The FTC took a look at search manipulation but eventually cleared Google, despite internal concerns. American antitrust law centers on harm to consumers, not businesses — and Google successfully argued that it’s simply offering a better experience than these other sites. But Yelp has since countered this claim with its own studies, suggesting that these cards reduce the usefulness of search results. Former FTC adviser Tim Wu called the research “surprising and shocking,” and it might count against Google in a Justice Department probe.

Google forces phone makers to bundle its apps

Google releases its Android operating system under an open-source license, but phone and tablet makers need to license popular apps like Google Maps and the Google Play Store. For a long time, these manufacturers had to bundle a whole suite of Google services, including Chrome and search. This disadvantaged rival browser and search engine companies, leading the EU to hand down a record-breaking €4.3 billion fine. In response, Google started offering European users a choice of browser and search engine. It also unbundled its services in Europe and started charging an app licensing fee instead.

This may be Google’s most direct equivalent to Microsoft’s “browser war,” which led to a massive antitrust trial in the ‘90s. But The Wall Street Journal’s reporting doesn’t mention Android, and the FTC’s earlier investigation focused more on ads and search practices. So we’ll have to wait to see how broad the Justice Department’s investigation really is.

Google could monopolize the web experience

All of the preceding claims have been around for years, and they involve core parts of Google’s business. But they’re not the only things that might catch the attention of antitrust watchdogs. Google AMP, for example, has raised eyebrows among regulators, activists, and web publishers. It makes pages load super fast on mobile browsers, but it also acts like a special Google-built portal to the web, granting the company a huge amount of power. Google has answered this criticism by giving up some control of AMP, which is an open-source project, to a multicompany committee.

To a far lesser extent, some critics are worried about Google’s moves to block “bad” ads on Chrome — noting that Google has the means and motive to favor its own ads in the process, and Chrome holds an estimated two-thirds of the browser market. When some code suggested that Google might limit third-party ad-blocking extensions, the developers of Ghostery threatened to file an antitrust complaint, until Google said it had never intended to break the extensions.

These complaints haven’t garnered nearly as much attention, and they’re likely to remain in the background of any antitrust probe. But they’re a reminder that Google’s reach is constantly expanding — and so are the complaints against it."
Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

"At Trump’s Agriculture Department, science is being plowed under",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gale A. Buchanan', 'Catherine E. Woteki', 'June At Pm']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/07/trumps-agriculture-department-science-is-being-plowed-under/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)

Gale A. Buchanan and Catherine E. Woteki are former chief scientists of the Agriculture Department, where they served (2006-2009 and 2010-2017, respectively) as undersecretary for research, education and economics.

For the second year in a row, Trump administration leadership at the Agriculture Department proposed budget cuts and took other steps that hamper agencies within the department that supply the data and science needed to inform farm and food policy.

Whether the actions at the USDA reflect malice or ignorance, the results are the same: Policymakers in Congress and America’s farmers will lack the sound science they need to make decisions about how best to feed the nation, improve the rural economy and bolster U.S. agricultural exports.

As the USDA’s chief scientists from the previous two administrations, we are deeply concerned about the harm being done to scientific integrity at the department. We won’t speculate on the motives of the Trump administration’s leaders at the USDA, but we can say that these proposals came only after objective studies and analyses produced by economists and scientists at the USDA’s Economic Research Service, or ERS, conflicted with Trump administration policies.

For example, analysis by ERS economists on the effects of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act stated, “Farm households with income between the 20th to 80th percentile see a modest reduction in their effective income tax rates, while wealthier households, the top 10 percent and top 1 percent, see the biggest decreases in their rates.”

The attempt to defund the ERS also offers some clues about what type of research the Trump administration seems to dislike. The budget suggested cuts to research into food assistance and nutrition, food safety, and analysis of farm, conservation and trade policy.

Numbers don’t lie, but you can attempt to hide them from Congress and the public, undermine them just enough to cast doubt or make them disappear altogether.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appears to be taking a multipronged approach toward dismantling the science that for years has undergirded policy decisions.

First, Perdue tried the direct approach: simply cutting the ERS budget. That approach failed last year when Congress restored the funds. The administration is trying again with its 2020 budget, proposing to cut $42 million — about 50 percent — from the ERS programs and reduce the number of full-time employees to 160 from 331.

Next, the Perdue-led USDA pushed a policy that required all published research from the department to be labeled “preliminary.” When scientists and economists publish in scientific journals, it is only after rigorous peer review. The “preliminary” label appears designed to undermine the research and strike a blow against evidence-based policymaking.

Finally, late last summer, Perdue shocked many researchers in food and agriculture with his decision to move the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of the Washington area. The USDA sidestepped the usual processes for relocation, such as conducting a search through the government’s General Services Administration, and selected potential homes in North Carolina, Indiana and Kansas City, Mo..

Employees learned earlier this year that after the USDA chooses the relocation site, they would have 120 days to move or quit. Many of the economists that would be affected instead found new jobs at other agencies in the District — creating the sort of brain drain that the administration has seemed intent on prompting with its proposed budget cuts.

Perdue also proposed moving oversight of the ERS to the chief economist in his office. We strongly oppose this move because it makes the unit vulnerable to political pressure.

The agency now reports to the chief scientist — a post that remains unfilled after President Trump’s nominee, Sam Clovis, a conservative radio talk show host and former Iowa campaign aide with no background in science, withdrew from consideration in November 2017. Congress should demand that the Trump administration nominate, as soon as possible, a new, independent chief scientist who can obtain swift and broad, bipartisan support.

Food and agriculture in the United States face perennial challenges from a multitude of sources: pests, diseases, droughts, flooding, brutally competitive markets and trade disputes. It is disheartening to think that the science underpinning these vital contributors to the U.S. economy, and to the health and well-being of every American, is under threat from the very government department overseeing them.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENT

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

A few more such errors and omissions, and Americans may begin to wonder if the Mueller report is worth the paper on which it was printed.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

OPERATION TARGETING MS-13 GANG IN TEXAS NETS NEARLY 2 DOZEN ARRESTS, OFFICIALS SAY

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

Elijah Cummings indicates he will move ahead with contempt vote against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/doj-2020-census-response-house-oversight/index.html,"(CNN) The chairman of the House Oversight Committee indicated Friday morning that he will proceed with a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over a dispute about documents regarding a potential citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday it was working to get the committee more documents in response to a subpoena for the information, but said some materials the panel has requested will continue to be withheld. Justice is also refusing to allow John Gore, a senior official in the civil rights division, to appear before the committee without department counsel in the room -- which the committee has thus far refused to allow.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said that offer was insufficient.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement Friday morning. ""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration's cover-up.""

Cummings had said Monday he would postpone the contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested.

Congress and Mueller need to step up and protect America from presidents like Trump,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donald Ayer', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/07/trump-tramples-constitution-congress-mueller-protect-america-column/1351993001/,"CLOSE

Congress should pass laws to prevent dangerous norm-smashing by Trump and potential like-minded successors. And Mueller must talk to counteract Barr.

I was appointed a United States attorney by President Ronald Reagan and later a deputy attorney general by President George H.W. Bush. All of us at the Justice Department swore an oath to defend the Constitution, not a president or political party. It is not easy for me to acknowledge that we are witnessing a slow-motion unraveling of the bedrock belief that no one is above the law, not even the president.

This unraveling is aided and abetted by a chief law enforcement officer who first articulated his extreme view of executive power more than 30 years ago: William Barr believes the attorney general is “the president’s lawyer.” He is acting like it today, breaking norms that protect the integrity of the justice system no matter who is in the White House. That is why former special counsel Robert Mueller must resist his own instincts to return to private life, and Congress must insist that the truth be told and that norms threatened today be codified into law.

We need a bipartisan response to Barr

Barr has just been thoroughly contradicted by the special counsel. Mueller’s public appearance makes all the more stunning Barr’s action in stepping in to all but exonerate the president 25 days before releasing even a redacted version of Mueller’s report which explicitly stated the opposite. This pattern of behavior by Barr is rooted in his unsolicited memo to the White House and the Justice Department auditioning for attorney general six months before he was nominated.

Mueller report: Attorney General Barr jumped the gun in clearing Trump of obstruction

In that memo, Barr laid out his extreme interpretation of presidential power and of the obstruction of justice statutes and argued it was nearly impossible for a president to commit the crime. He critically pre-judged Mueller’s conclusions before reviewing evidence, writing “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived.” Barr made the untenable claim that Section 1512(c)(2) does not prevent a president from exercising his or her authority over law enforcement proceedings to improperly interfere in an investigation. This extreme view literally puts a president above the law.

How can all of us across the ideological spectrum who reject that view respond effectively?

First, Congress needs to find its voice. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress far-reaching authority to oversee the executive branch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham are actively providing political cover for Trump to eviscerate centuries-old norms. They must remind themselves that what benefits a runaway executive of their party, could empower an aspiring despot from the left next time. The Mueller report makes a very strong case that Trump obstructed justice, a conclusion more than 1,000 former prosecutors, including lifelong Republicans, reached independently.

Americans need to hear Mueller testimony

Mueller’s report includes 10 instances where President Donald Trump tried to cover up the truth, including ordering the White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, and then ordering McGahn to “dispute the story and to create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” The president sought to influence a number of people to lie, and even directed aides to create false documents and reports. Perhaps worst of all, Trump appears to have attempted to silence a number of witnesses, by dangling pardons as a reward for stonewalling investigators. If anyone else did what the president did, they would be facing prosecution and prison. Congress must hold hearings, with or without administration witnesses.

Second, the American people need to hear direct public testimony from Robert Mueller. I have known Bob Mueller since 1977 when we were assistant U.S. attorneys in adjacent offices, and I have always respected his sense of rectitude and restraint, but he waited weeks to set the record straight. By then, the attorney general had whitewashed his report in a conclusory letter and even held a press conference to further tout the White House political spin now discredited by Mueller — discredited everywhere that is but in the minds of busy Americans without time to dissect Mueller’s 448-page, carefully-worded tome.

Given Barr’s unprecedented efforts to misstate his investigation’s findings, Mueller needs to recognize that his work is not quite done. If all he does is repeat the findings of his own report for a second time, that will in itself be a critical act of public service.

Start the climb back to the America we know

Third, Congress needs to legislate. The Mueller report identified norms smashed by this president which must be codified to have meaning again. Barr’s distressing success in obfuscating the law indicates a need for a new statute (perhaps to be called the William P. Barr No One Is Above The Law Act) reaffirming in unmistakable terms that the president is bound by the law like everyone else.

Given Barr’s assertions to the contrary, Congress should probably spell out that a president commits a crime when he or she falsifies a document or orders someone to create false official documents, uses the offer of a pardon to interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, or encourages a Justice Department investigation into his or her political adversary. And this should be followed by a statement that the inclusion of these specific behaviors engaged in by Trump does not suggest the exclusion of other acts knowingly taken to obstruct an on-going investigation.

It will be a long climb back to the America we have known for generations — but unless Congress does its constitutional duty where Attorney General Barr has been derelict, future presidents might not feel compelled to lead us back in that direction at all. Patriots of all parties must stop this president from running roughshod over the Constitution we are all sworn to defend.

NYT reporter: Sources say Christopher Steele worried DOJ inspector general will 'throw him under the bus',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nyt-reporter-sources-say-christopher-steele-worried-doj-inspector-general-will-throw-him-under-the-bus,"Trump dossier author Christopher Steele is seemingly deeply worried about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation being carried out by the Justice Department inspector general.

Matthew Rosenberg, a correspondent for the New York Times and CNN national security analyst, said he has spoken with people in Steele's orbit who confirmed the British ex-spy is willing to meet with “investigators close to the inspector general investigation."" But Steele is also “incredibly concerned and obsessed that this investigation is going to throw him under the bus,"" Rosenberg said Tuesday on CNN.

This week a report from the Times in the United Kingdom said Steele is willing to meet with U.S. officials, but only to discuss his work for the FBI as a confidential source, and wants the United States to get permission from the U.K. government first. The report came out as President Trump was in the country for a state visit.

Quoting sources close to Steele, Rosenberg framed Steele’s thinking as, ""‘Look, I was working on this dossier other people were paying for — that the Democrats were paying for. I saw things that seemed frightening to me and alarming. And I went to old contacts at the FBI to tell them. I wasn’t a paid source in this case.’ That’s his view of it.”

Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Rosenberg said Steele does not think he should be blamed for any actions of the FBI or DOJ and “he was simply helping them out and what they did with it, whether they misused it in a FISA or whatever they did, he had nothing to do with that.”

Rosenberg agreed with this assessment, saying Steele wasn’t part of the FISA process, but was “simply a source of information.”

Steele worked to provide information from his dossier to over a dozen journalists and media organizations. Steele also used various government contacts, such as top DOJ official Bruce Ohr, State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, and others, in his efforts to get the dossier into the hands of U.S. officials and have it taken seriously.

“[Steele] is acutely concerned that he’s going to be thrown under the bus here,” Rosenberg noted.

Earlier this year Attorney General William Barr said he expected inspector general Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be wrapped up by the end of May or June. Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, so if Horowitz does soon speak with Steele it is unclear what that will mean for the inquiry that was thought to be winding down if not complete.

Barr also is taking a broader look into the origins of the Russia investigation and picked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review."

Watchdog will get an outside review after flawed FEMA disaster response reports,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'June At Pm']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-will-get-an-outside-review-after-flawed-disaster-response-reports/2019/06/07/ebca0b2a-8922-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html,"Leslie Andermann Gallagher surveys the flood damage to her home on Aug. 17, 2016, in Sorrento, La. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

[Read the inspector general’s internal review of the oversight missteps here]

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."

Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, a Russian-born U.K. academic said FBI source Stefan Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn.

MUELLER FILES SHOW FLYNN UNDER INVESTIGATION EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT

Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance at the time of the contacts.

The information was contained in a so-called ""302"" witness report prepared by top FBI brass and finalized more than three weeks after Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 White House interview with two FBI agents, including Peter Strzok. Flynn previously served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration, before advising the Trump campaign and briefly joining that administration. A semi-redacted version of the 302 was released last December that omitted reference to some of Flynn's contacts after his DIA service.

In particular, only the unredacted 302 indicates that Flynn told the interviewing agents that he had ""met with Kislyak at the Russian Ambassador's residence next to the University Club prior"" to traveling to Russia in December 2015. The mid-afternoon visit, which the 302 characterized as a ""courtesy call,"" came as Flynn was preparing to travel to Moscow as a private citizen to speak at a Russia Today (RT) event.

Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak on Middle East issues at the gathering, where he shared a table with President Vladimir Putin. According to the 302, Flynn received an appropriate ""threat briefing"" from U.S. officials before attending.

Additionally, according to both the redacted and unredacted 302s, ""Flynn stated he called Ambassador Kislyak following [former GRU Director Igor] Sergun's death in Lebanon ... to express his condolences"" and note that Sergun was ""someone the U.S. could work with."" Segun died Jan. 3, 2016.

Just days later, as Flynn's role informally advising the Trump campaign became known, a Russian-born U.K. academic, Svetlana Lokhova, said she received an invitation out of the blue to a private dinner party with Halper.

Halper is widely reported to have been a confidential source in the FBI's original probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis.

“It was very, very unusual because Stefan Halper and I, despite being part of the same group, and meeting pretty much in a public forum, we've had no personal contact at all. [Halper] to me was an obnoxious academic who absolutely hated all Russians,"" Lokhova told Fox News in April.

FLYNN: FBI PUSHED ME NOT TO HAVE LAWYER AT FATEFUL WHITE HOUSE INTERVIEW

In a lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing, as new information suggests the Trump team was targeted earlier than previously known. Buried in the second volume of the Mueller report was a mention of an existing FBI investigation of Flynn ""based on his relationship with the Russian government,"" which predated Flynn's phone calls during the presidential transition in December 2016 with Kislyak that ultimately led to his termination for lying.

It had been originally thought that Flynn’s communications with Kislyak – picked up by the U.S. intelligence community – made the FBI suspicious, sparking the Flynn probe.

According to Mueller's report, ""members of the intelligence community were surprised by Russia's decision not to retaliate in response to the sanctions. When analyzing Russia's response, they became aware of Flynn's discussion of sanctions with Kislyak. Previously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn based on his relationship with the Russian government. Flynn's contacts with Kislyak became a key component of that investigation.""

After Fox News reported on the development last month, President Trump questioned, in a tweet, why he wasn't briefed on the probe in 2016 ""so that I could make a change?""

Separately, the 302 released Thursday also revealed for the first time that in late December 2016, Kislyak called Flynn to set up a videoconference between the president-elect and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The call was to take place Jan. 21, 2017 -- the day after Trump's inauguration."
EPA will drill into Colorado mine for cleanup investigation,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/southern-colorado/epa-will-drill-into-colorado-mine-for-cleanup-investigation,"DENVER (AP) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to drill a test well into an inactive mine tunnel in southwestern Colorado to get information for a Superfund cleanup, the agency said Friday.

The EPA said it will drill into the American Tunnel next month to measure water levels and investigate how the passage is connected to other shafts.

The agency is looking for ways to stop or treat contaminated water pouring into rivers from old mine sites in the Bonita Peak Superfund area north of Silverton.

The agency designated the Superfund site after it inadvertently triggered a spill while doing excavation work at the inactive Gold King Mine in August 2015. The spill released 3 million gallons (11.4 million liters) of wastewater, polluting rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.

The Gold King is part of the Superfund cleanup.

The EPA said it would follow strict safety guidelines when drilling the test well into the American Tunnel.

The agency also said it has modified an order to Sunnyside Gold Corp. to pay for some of the cleanup investigation, but no details of the changes were released.

Sunnyside owns property in the area, and the EPA wants the company to help pay for the cleanup. Sunnyside says it's not responsible for the pollution and shouldn't have to pay.

Sunnyside reclamation director Kevin Roach said the company is reviewing the revised order."
USDA investigates unapproved GMO wheat found in Washington state,https://www.reuters.com,"['Julie Ingwersen', 'Min Read']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wheat-gmo/usda-investigates-unapproved-gmo-wheat-found-in-washington-state-idUSKCN1T900O,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed the discovery of unapproved, genetically modified (GM) wheat plants growing in an un-planted agricultural field in Washington state.

There was no evidence the wheat had entered the food supply, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement on Friday. The wheat is resistant to glyphosate, a widely used herbicide commonly referred to as Roundup.

“USDA is collaborating with our state, industry and trading partners, and we are committed to providing all our partners with timely and transparent information about our findings,” the statement said.

There are currently no commercially approved genetically modified wheat varieties, and incidences of rogue plants are rare. However, unapproved plants were found in 2018 in Alberta, Canada, in 2016 in Washington state, in 2014 in Montana and in 2013 in Oregon.

A Bayer Crop Science spokeswoman said the latest finding may have occurred on the site of a former field trial. Last year Bayer bought Monsanto, which in the late 1990s and early 2000s developed wheat genetically modified to withstand its Roundup herbicide, a weed killer containing glyphosate.

Monsanto shelved the genetically engineered wheat in 2004 amid market concern about rejection from foreign buyers. The United States was the world’s second-largest wheat exporter after Russia in the 2018/19 marketing year.

“We have been informed by USDA of a possible detection of GM wheat in Washington State, possibly on the site of a former field trial,” Bayer Crop Sciences spokeswoman Charla Lord said.

“We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation,” Lord said.

Samples of the wheat plants from the field in Washington were sent to the USDA’s Federal Grain Inspection Service lab in Kansas City, Missouri, as well as a USDA lab in Pullman, Washington, for testing and confirmation, according to a joint statement from the National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S. Wheat Associates, a trade group that promotes U.S. wheat sales.

Bayer, which inherited litigation over Roundup with its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto last year, faces lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs in the United States, alleging the product causes cancer.

A California jury last month awarded more than $2 billion to a couple who claimed Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It was the largest U.S. jury verdict to date against the company in litigation over the chemical."
DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
Treasury pushes back at report critical of Trump tax law's effects,https://thehill.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/447513-treasury-pushes-back-at-report-critical-of-trump-tax-laws-effects,"The Treasury Department is pushing back on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report finding that President Trump Donald John TrumpO'Rourke hammers Trump on tariffs: The damage 'has already been done' O'Rourke hammers Trump on tariffs: The damage 'has already been done' Schumer mocks Trump: 'I'm sure we won't be hearing any more' about illegal immigration MORE’s 2017 tax law had little to no effect on the economy in its first year, calling the methodology of the report “flawed.”

“After careful review of the Report, it appears that CRS’s economic analysis of the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] used a flawed methodology that tacitly assumed the anticipation of the Trump Administration’s tax and regulatory relief had no effect on the economic outlook of the United States,” Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy David Kautter wrote in a letter to lawmakers earlier this week.

CRS, an entity within the Library of Congress that provides analyses to lawmakers, said in its report about the 2017 tax law that “the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.” CRS’s analysis was based on comparing actual gross domestic product (GDP) figures in 2018 to the Congressional Budget Office’s April 2018 estimates of GDP with and without the tax cut.

The report, released late last month, quickly caught the attention of Democratic lawmakers and policy experts, who highlighted it as proof that the GOP tax law has fallen short of Republicans’ promises.

The report comes as Trump is starting to run for reelection, and a key part of his campaign is likely to be the strength of the economy during his first term. The tax law Trump signed in December 2017 is the president’s biggest legislative accomplishment to date, and Democrats are likely to use the CRS report to undercut Trump’s arguments that his policies have boosted the economy.

Treasury’s criticism of the CRS report centers on the fact that the service compared 2018 data to economic forecasts from the beginning of 2018, rather than forecasts from before Trump took office. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had increased its estimate of 2018 GDP between June 2017 and April 2018.

Treasury argued that the CRS report excludes an economic theory that people will take actions, such as new investment and hiring, before a policy change is implemented if they expect the policy change to occur.

“Beginning in January 2017, the Trump Administration began implementing an economic agenda to reduce burdensome regulations, engage the private sector to promote pro-growth policies, and negotiate trade deals to open up market access for American businesses,” Kautter wrote. “Therefore, appropriate — and truly unbiased — economic analysis should have benchmarked the impact of the Trump Administration’s economic agenda against forecasts of the economy generated prior to January 2017.”

“Analysis that commences after that time — let alone after the policies are implemented — is biased by the fact that people in the economy started responding immediately to the aggressive agenda pursued by President Trump, including by the widespread expectation of individual and corporate tax cuts and the resultant effects on the economy,” Kautter added.

He also said that CRS’s report excluded data that “would likely have led to vastly different conclusions.”

Treasury’s letter was sent to a handful of lawmakers, including the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee.

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, agreed with Treasury’s arguments and said it was good for the department to push back on the CRS report.

Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenTreasury pushes back at report critical of Trump tax law's effects Treasury pushes back at report critical of Trump tax law's effects Lawmakers reintroduce bipartisan IRS bill with 'Free File' provision removed MORE (Ore.), said in response to the CRS report that Republicans have attacked every nonpartisan group that has found that their tax law didn’t live up to its promises, and “this is more of the same.”

“The tax cuts haven’t paid for themselves,” Wyden said in a statement to The Hill. “They haven’t raised wages by $4,000. And they haven’t resulted in massive investment.”

Jane Gravelle, one of the authors of the CRS analysis, defended the report.

“We stand by this report. I think the analysis is solid,"" she said.

A CRS spokesperson echoed Gravelle and also said the Service stood behind the report.

Gravelle said that she doesn’t think there was much of a reaction in anticipation of the tax-cut law, because she thinks that people didn’t really know what would happen with tax-cut legislation until late in 2017.

Treasury said in its letter, however, that business optimism and consumer sentiment measures spiked shortly after Trump’s election in anticipation of the president’s agenda.

Kyle Pomerleau, a tax-policy expert at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, said that CRS was correct to compare actual GDP to CBO’s April 2018 projections, rather than to CBO’s projections from 2016, because “more than just the tax law had changed” between 2016 and 2018. He said that the administration’s point about people taking action in anticipation of tax cuts is valid, but not completely relevant to CRS’s analysis which just focused on the law’s effects in 2018.

Pomerleau said that the CRS report “reflects some words of caution that a lot of us have been saying to lawmakers” about not being too optimistic about the GOP tax law’s economic effects.

But he also said that there was an area where CRS misinterpreted some of what CBO estimated, which led to CRS coming to too strong a conclusion about the tax law’s limited impact on the economy.

CRS posted an updated version of the report on Friday that fixed the issue Pomerleau flagged, but Gravelle said that the update doesn't change the report's conclusions."
"Civil rights groups snub Barr meeting on police reform, despite past outcry",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/civil-rights-groups-snub-barr-meeting-on-police-reform-despite-past-outcry,"Attorney General Bill Barr got a surprise this week when he hosted a listening session for civil rights groups supposedly concerned about the Justice Department's commitment to police reform.

Hardly anybody showed up.

DOJ REVEALS DEMS ACKNOWLEDGED BARR SUBPOENA WAS 'OVERBROAD'; NADLER FIRES BACK, OFFERS TO MEET 'WITHOUT CONDITIONS'

The meeting itself stemmed from a commitment he made to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., during his confirmation hearing. The 2020 presidential candidate had challenged Barr to host the session to discuss a memo from his predecessor Jeff Sessions limiting the use of so-called ""consent decrees"" to reform local police departments accused of rights violations.

But after Barr invited numerous groups to such a meeting on Tuesday, the only person to attend was Frederick Misilo, president of the Arc, an organization that provides advocacy for those with intellectual disabilities.

A statement from the Justice Department said the meeting between Barr and Misilo was “productive” and touted the “critical role” of partnerships between the federal government and state agencies in protecting people’s rights.

“As Attorney General Barr publicly stated in his Senate hearings, he is committed to vigorous enforcement of federal civil rights laws and has directed the Department to continue its diligent work on these matters,” the statement said.

However, a Justice Department official accused the other invited organizations of letting politics get in the way of advancing that conversation.

“The attorney general clearly spent the time to listen to this one president, and if there were more folks, we would have had more perspectives, but they kind of just wanted to play the political games,” the official told The Washington Post.

Misilo told the Post that the 40-minute discussion with Barr was “helpful,” and that Barr expressed “an openness to take our interests under advisement,” though Barr did not commit to any specific action.

The other organizations on Barr’s invite list were the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Fair Housing Alliance, UnidosUS, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups, sent a letter to Barr on Tuesday explaining why the above groups were not going to meet with him. They said a larger number of them had initially requested a meeting with Barr, but the attorney general only selected a portion of them. The letter was signed by the six groups who declined Barr’s invitation, as well as others who were not invited -- including The Drug Policy Alliance, Human Rights Watch, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Urban League.

""In our view, the decision not to include certain organizations severely limits the Department's ability to learn about and consider the critical civil rights and public safety issues at stake,"" the letter said.

The handling of consent decrees has long been a contentious issue.

The Obama administration had used such decrees in cities where there were concerns of unfair treatment of minorities by the police. A consent decree with the Baltimore Police Department, for example, came about after a DOJ investigation found patterns of discriminatory conduct.

Sessions’ memo said that while consent decrees are “sometimes necessary and appropriate to secure compliance with federal law,” there are federalism-based concerns with federal court decrees that govern state and local government entities. It outlined requirements for future consent decrees, including defined limits on the terms of decrees, as well as “specific and measurable actions that trigger the decree's termination,” so that a consent decree can come to an end if an agency shows that they have “come into durable compliance” with the relevant federal laws.

COMEY DENOUNCES BARR AFTER CBS INTERVIEW: 'AN AG SHOULD NOT BE ECHOING CONSPIRACY THEORIES'

The Justice Department stated that Barr is also planning a listening session with state and local law enforcement, and that ""the Department's door remains open to groups who wish to discuss these important civil and constitutional issues.""

Sessions' memo was sent out in November 2018. Since then, the DOJ has still used consent decrees, entering into one to reform the Chicago Police Department in January 2019."
State Dept. Forces Out Official Who Worked on Plan That Led to Ex-Employer’s Arms Deals,https://www.wsj.com,"['Dion Nissenbaum', 'Alex Leary', 'Alex.Leary Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-dept-forces-out-official-who-worked-on-plan-that-led-to-ex-employers-arms-deals-11559772745,"The State Department has forced out a senior official who played a role in crafting a plan that led to billions of dollars going to the defense firm he formerly represented as a lobbyist, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Charles Faulkner, who previously represented Raytheon Co., took part in an unusual Trump administration move to declare an emergency over tensions with Iran to fast-track $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, circumventing normal congressional review, these people said.

He resigned as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department in early May after working on efforts leading to the emergency declaration, these people said.

Mr. Faulkner’s role in the process has raised concerns in Congress, where Democratic lawmakers want to know if Mr. Faulkner violated Trump administration ethics rules by taking part in discussions on the declaration, which cleared the way for Raytheon’s $2 billion deal to sell precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“Should he be making decisions about arms sales he was working on before he came to government?” asked a congressional aide.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans a hearing on next Wednesday on the State Department decisions, according to the panel, and Mr. Faulkner’s role is expected to be a focus of the questioning.

Mr. Faulkner has been a polarizing figure, according to the current and former officials at the State Department, where he served for the last two years as both deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, which manages relations with Congress.

Mr. Faulkner declined to comment, referring questions to the State Department, where officials said they couldn't comment on personnel matters.

Amid the rising tensions with Iran, the State Department sought ways to push through the stalled arms sales to the Gulf, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

Related Trump Invokes Emergency Arms Sales Authority to Counter Iran (May 24)

Under a new U.S. law, Secretary of State Pompeo had to order a suspension of some American military support to the Saudi-led coalition unless he assured Congress in writing that the Gulf nation was doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen.

At the time, Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) had placed a legislative freeze on Raytheon’s $2 billion proposal to sell 120,000 precision guided missiles to the two Gulf allies in the midst of concerns about their use of American weapons in Yemen.

In last year’s debate, Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs team were the only ones to urge Mr. Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia was doing enough to satisfy U.S. concerns, according to people familiar with the decision.

Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs unit said a failure to do so would jeopardize pending arms sales to the Gulf, which included the stalled Raytheon deals, these people said.

At the time, Mr. Pompeo overruled most others on his team and sided with Mr. Faulkner and the legislative team, these people said, and issued the emergency declaration certifying that Saudi Arabia satisfied U.S. concerns about civilian casualties in the conflict.

Since then, members of Congress have expressed increasing alarm about America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed by the Saudi-led coalition, according to the U.N., and Congress recently voted to cut off all American support to the Gulf countries amid concerns that they weren’t doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in airstrikes using U.S.-manufactured missiles. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.

Saudi Arabia’s standing in Washington has also been hit by the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post writer killed last year by a Saudi hit team at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

Mr. Trump has been a steadfast advocate of arms sales to allies in the Middle East. When he defended his close ties with Saudi Arabia after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, he cited arms sales as a major reason.

Newsletter Sign-up

In a statement in November, he wrote, referring to the military needs of Gulf allies: “$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be enormous beneficiaries – and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.”

U.S. lawmakers question Mr. Faulkner’s work on the arms sales and want to know if he violated government ethics rules by working on a decision that directly affects Raytheon.

Mr. Faulkner took part in more recent discussions over whether the department should use the emergency provisions of the arms export control laws to fast-track arms sales to Middle East allies, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

He already was preparing to leave the State Department when the discussions over the arms sales arose, the officials said. But his work on the issue contributed to his departure on May 10, the officials said.

The Trump administration required political appointees like Mr. Faulkner to sign ethics pledges that bar former lobbyists from working on issues “directly or substantially related” to former clients for two years while serving in government.

The administration has granted some limited waivers to the pledge, but Mr. Faulkner’s name does not appear on an administration waiver list.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Mr. Menendez, announced plans to try and halt the arms sales. The 22 senators said they would work to convince Congress to reject the deals if Mr. Pompeo doesn’t withdraw his decision, potentially setting up a new showdown with the White House.

“We have an obligation to ensure the adequate guardrails are in place and that weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do not exacerbate the [Yemen] conflict,” said Sen. Todd Young, (R., Ind.). “Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, but the current threats that have been briefed to members of Congress do not justify taking this dramatic step.”

Mr. Menendez, in a statement, said: “We will not stand idly by and allow the president or the secretary of State to further erode congressional review and oversight of arm sales.”

Why Trump's Vietnam comments matter on D-Day,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/d-day-anniversary-us-presidents-service/index.html,"(CNN) On the 75th anniversary of a defining battle of the defining war of human history so far, it's clear that military service has never been less important to American voters.

Six US presidents served overseas during World War II, but none since President George H.W. Bush have gone abroad, if they served at all. At this point, we might get a President who served in Afghanistan or Iraq -- that's South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard or Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton -- but it's almost certain the US will never have a commander in chief who served in Vietnam.

It has had three, including Trump, who found a way around the draft. That's old news, but it doesn't mean Trump won't still have to answer questions about it, as he did in Wednesday's interview with the British journalist Piers Morgan, who asked him if he would have liked to have served.

Trump ""was never a fan"" of Vietnam

The interview was conducted in the underground bunker where Winston Churchill led the British government during the Blitz and World War II.

""Do you wish you'd been able to serve? Would you have liked to serve your country?"" Morgan asked.

Trump replied by questioning Vietnam, mirroring some of the anti-war sentiment of the '60s and '70s.

""Well I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever -- you're talking about Vietnam at that time and nobody ever heard of the country,"" Trump said, adding the non sequitur that, today, the government of Vietnam has been successful negotiating in global trade.

He went on to say that he wasn't active in protesting the war as a young man, but he didn't think the US should ever have taken part.

""But, uh, nobody heard of Vietnam and then say well what are we doing. So many people dying. So I was never a fan of -- this isn't like I'm fighting against Nazi Germany. I'm fighting -- we're fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people. Now I wasn't out in the streets marching. I wasn't saying, you know, I'm going to move to Canada, which a lot of people did. But no, I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something that we should have been involved in.""

Senator calls Trump a coward

Trump's comments drew a stinging rebuke from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat and veteran who lost her legs in a helicopter accident while deployed to Iraq.

Appearing on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Wednesday night, she called Trump a coward.

""I don't know anyone who has served in uniform, especially in combat, who would say they are a fan of war,"" she said. ""In fact, I opposed the Iraq war, but volunteered to go when my unit was deployed.""

She accused him of using wealth and privilege to avoid service.

#CadetBoneSpurs: no one cares whether you were a ""fan"" of the Vietnam War. No one believes you were medically unfit to serve. You used your wealth & privilege to avoid serving your country five times, forcing another American to serve in your place each time. 1/ https://t.co/bSZbQlnWMf — Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) June 5, 2019

Making up for lack of service with spending

Trump said he's making up for his lack of military service by being President.

""Would you have liked to have served generally - perhaps in another (way)?"" Morgan asked.

""I would not have minded that at all. I would have been honored. But I think I make up for it now. I mean look, $700 billion I gave last year and then this year $716 billion and I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we are rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.""

This deserves a quick fact check. Trump did not personally give the military $700 billion or $716 billion. Congress did, when it passed appropriations bills last year. Trump signed them, and it is his administration's responsibility to now spend the money.

But it says something about how he views his role as President and the dismissive way he's treated Congress and its responsibilities, that he takes personal credit for spending taxpayer money.

It's also more than a bit awkward for him to argue that the military will be built up to a level it's never seen before under him when he's preparing to commemorate D-Day, when the entire country was mobilized in the war effort. More than 16 million Americans served in World War II from a US population of around 140 million in 1940. It was a total war, even for the US, which was far from any of the front lines.

Fewer Americans serve

The portion of the population that served in World War II is much larger than the portion that served during Vietnam, when more than 8.7 million Americans were in the military from a population of 203 million in 1970.

Despite the conflict in Afghanistan lasting longer than any in US history, fewer and fewer Americans have served in the military. The VA does not list a total number of service members during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are currently about 1.3 million people in the military, coming from a population of close to 341 million, according to Census projections

6 Presidents served overseas in World War II

In the years after World War II, military service was almost a prerequisite for politicians and presidents for generations during and after World War II. Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and gave the order for D-Day 75 years ago, went on to serve two terms as President. He ended hostilities in the Korean War shortly after taking office.

No more.

No presidents with Vietnam service

Three of the last four US presidents -- Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump -- had no military service at all. George W. Bush was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard -- his way around Vietnam.

Two other politicians who were of military age during Vietnam are running against Trump as Democrats. They also deferred military service or sought to be exempt. All three are in their 70s, which makes it likely this is the last presidential election in which a Vietnam-era politician will be featured.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is running for President as a Democrat, applied to be a conscientious objector during Vietnam . The application was ultimately rejected, but he was too old to be drafted at that point. In 2015, he said during a CNN debate that he's no longer a pacifist.

Joe Biden, the former vice president also running for President, received five Vietnam deferments for education and was later disqualified because of asthma

Two other politicians who came of age during Vietnam are running in the Democratic primary. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee received a student deferment and had a high draft number for his birth year, as did former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper

Plenty of Vietnam veterans have sought the White House, including medal of honor winner Bob Kerrey, who did not get very far. Several Vietnam veterans got their party's nomination, including Al Gore, John Kerry and John McCain.

Since the election of Bill Clinton over decorated former military pilot and wartime president George H.W. Bush in 1992, American voters have shown that avoiding service during Vietnam is not a dealbreaker.

A new generation of warrior politicians

A real question in 2020 is whether it's a desirable plus. There has been no draft since Vietnam, and there have been many fewer Americans serving in the military.

But there are multiple younger presidential aspirants who volunteered for the military and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Gabbard has made her military service a centerpiece of her campaign and cites it as the impetus for her platform of disentangling the US from foreign conflicts.

Former FBI lawyer James Baker cooperating with DOJ inspector general's FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-cooperating-with-doj-inspector-generals-fisa-abuse-investigation,"The Justice Department watchdog's investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse might not be winding down yet.

Former top FBI lawyer James Baker said this week he is cooperating with the Justice Department inspector general's investigation.

""I have had a longstanding relationship with the inspector general's office, because I firmly believe in the appropriateness and the need for effective oversight of the FBI,"" Baker said in a CNN interview.

Baker's admission is another sign that despite what Attorney General William Barr said earlier this year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation may not be completed by early June.

A focus of Horowitz's investigation is the FBI's use of an unverified dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, to obtain warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Although Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, a British newspaper reported Horowitz may soon be interviewing Steele, casting into further uncertainty the status of the inquiry.

Baker took a lead role in reviewing those FISA applications before submitting them to the FISA court. He has said he took the information ""seriously"" but ""not necessarily literally,"" and also that he is ""nervous"" about Horowitz.

Baker told CNN he is also open to helping Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham with their review of the origins of the Russia investigation. He stressed that it was a ""small group"" who led the FBI's counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign, namely former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for the Lawfare blog and joined the conservative think tank R Street Institute.

He is also under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media during his time at the bureau."
