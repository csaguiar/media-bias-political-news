WASHINGTON—A day after President Trump threatened to impose across-the-board tariffs on Mexico if it doesn’t crack down on the flow of migrants into the U.S., business groups and lawmakers expressed opposition to the plan, while the Mexican government said it would meet with the U.S. to explore a diplomatic solution.

Mr. Trump’s tweet late Thursday that the U.S. could impose 5% tariffs on nearly $360 billion in Mexican imports caught some of his aides by surprise, and the plan was opposed by his top trade adviser, Robert Lighthizer,..."

He Can Be Found On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-president-trump-obama-treason,"Attorney General William Barr has broken with President Trump on the issue of whether or not Obama-era officials committed treason.

Barr, in a sit-down interview with CBS News, was asked whether he agreed with previous comments Trump has made suggesting some people with ties to the former president’s administration had done so.

“You don’t think that they have committed treason?” Barr was asked by reporter Jan Crawford.

“Not as a legal matter,” he replied. “Sometimes people can convince themselves that what they're doing is in the higher interest and better good.

BARR RIPS 'LEGAL ANALYSIS' IN MUELLER REPORT: 'IT DID NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OF THE DEPARTMENT'

""They don't realize that what they're doing is really antithetical to the democratic system that we have,” he said.

Trump has previously accused the Obama-era FBI of “TREASON” on Twitter and called for “long jail sentences” on those who he believes carried out the act.

“My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!” he tweeted earlier this month.

In March, he also said during a White House event that: “there are people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things -- I would say treasonous things -- against our country.”

In the same interview, Barr was asked about the handling of his initial four-page summary of Mueller’s report, which he shared in late March. Barr and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said they determined that the evidence found in Mueller’s probe was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis, a lot of the legal analysis in the report,” Barr said. “It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the viewpoint of a particular lawyer or lawyers, so we applied what we saw was the right law.”

Speaking of Mueller's findings on obstruction, Barr said, “The bottom line was that Bob Mueller identified some episodes. He did not reach a conclusion. He provided both sides of the issue. And his conclusion was he was not exonerating the president, but wasn’t finding a crime either.”

Barr’s comments come after Mueller made a rare public appearance this week—his first and only in his tenure as special counsel. Mueller announced that the investigation was officially complete and that he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life."
How Trump’s Trade War Is Being Fought Around the World,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Amie Tsang', 'Carlos Tejada']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/trade-war-trump.html,"Europe

The prospect of punishing tariffs from the United States has loomed for several months after steel and aluminum tariffs imposed last year rattled American allies in Europe.

Mr. Trump has contended that imports of foreign cars and car parts are causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security.

“The European Union treats us, I would say, worse than China. They’re just smaller,” he said in May. “They send Mercedes-Benzes in here like they are cookies.”

He has threatened tariffs of 25 percent on the millions of foreign cars and car parts imported by the United States each year. The move could inflict damage in states like Alabama and South Carolina, which are home to big Mercedes-Benz and BMW assembly plants.

This past month, the White House put off a decision on imposing these tariffs, leaving six months to negotiate a trade deal to address the problem.

The United States was already struggling in negotiations with the European Union, which has refused to consider demands to allow more American agricultural products into Europe. The Trump administration says a deal without agriculture would not pass Congress, but populist politicians in Europe have seized on some American products and practices — like the use of chlorine to sterilize chickens — to justify retaining trade barriers.

Countries like France and Belgium have also balked at joining talks because of the Trump administration’s refusal in 2017 to sign a global pact on climate change. And leaders of the Green coalition in the European Parliament have said they will not sign trade agreements with countries that have not ratified the climate accord."

John F. Harris is founding editor of POLITICO and author of ""The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.""

For years, a growing stripe of Democrats has argued that what their party needs is a leader willing to shatter old assumptions, a radical disrupter.

Well, Democrats already have found their transformational figure for the 2020 campaign. His name is Donald Trump.

Story Continued Below

No one could miss the obvious ways this president—despite his deviations from traditional conservative orthodoxy—has turned the Republican Party into the pro-Trump party. It could be easy to miss, however, some of the less obvious ways Trump also has made himself the defining force of the anti-Trump party.

All presidents tend to reshape the politics of their era, sometimes in ways that long outlast their time in office. JFK’s mastery of television infused once-dowdy progressive politics with a measure of glamour that politicians spent decades emulating; Ronald Reagan’s success in using well-turned anecdotes and homilies to drive a conservative movement shapes the presidency to this day.

It is striking, though, how true this has been even in the 2020 Democratic primary, in which the competition is over which candidate can most credibly claim that he or she will not just beat Trump but repudiate all he stands for.

On stylistic and even substantive grounds, Trump is arguably exerting more gravitational pull on Democratic politics than the party’s most recent president, Barack Obama, who left its down-ballot infrastructure in tatters, and far more than another Democratic figure, Bill Clinton, who once could claim that he had remade the party in his own fashion.

From the once-unthinkable candidates vying to replace this president to their mimicry of his hard-punching way of politics, Democrats are showing that it is possible—even unavoidable—simultaneously to loathe Trump and be swept along by his disruptive current. Here’s how Trump has indelibly altered how Democrats run for president:

1. Anyone's Plausible

The most immediate way Trump is driving the Democratic debate is in the size of the presidential field—unprecedentedly large—and in its diversity, filled with candidates who surely would have flunked the plausibility test in an earlier time.

The threshold question confronting any candidate is basically a matter of imagination: Does it seem conceivable this person could really be president of the United States?

That question will never be the same in a Trump context. What is inconceivable compared to a reality-TV star and habitue of the New York tabloids with a decadeslong trail of financial and sexual controversies?

Virtually every top-tier candidate on the Democratic side is benefiting to some degree from Trump’s demolition of old standards of presidential plausibility. Not long ago, a 77-year-old small-state socialist would have been deemed inconceivable, but Bernie Sanders is not. So would a 37-year mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana, but Pete Buttigieg is not. Nor Texan Beto O’Rourke, who made few waves in three terms in Congress and did not win his statewide race. Nor Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Massachusetts law professor who didn’t run for office until she was in her 60s, nor Julián Castro, who in years past would find few takers that his time as HUD secretary was a likely path to commander in chief. Even the most conventional pol, former Vice President Joe Biden, would at age 76 three decades after his first presidential run be seen as a highly improbable contender.

Some version of, “Well, if Trump can win … ” is the principal engine behind the fact that there are two dozen candidates—a number that itself would have been wildly improbable. In fact, it is candidates with impressive traditional credentials—senators like Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet and governors like Jay Inslee and John Hickenlooper—who are struggling most to clear the give-me-a-break bar.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/2275/1155968404_5999037774001_5999041282001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Trump’s example has not only broadened the standards of presidential qualifications, but is helping erase old lines about disqualifications—unofficial standards that were nonetheless primly enforced by political insiders and the news media. If O’Rourke’s presidential campaign flops, it won’t be because arrests (charges later dropped) for drunken driving and burglary from the 1990s were an obstacle to his campaign, nor is the fact that Kamala Harris once publicly dated a married man (then-San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown) around the same time. The more recent controversy over whether Biden is too handsy and familiar in ways that made some women uncomfortable has passed quickly. Never mind the phenomenon of Andrew Yang, whose geekiness would have made him a laughingstock in years past; or that of spiritual guru Marianne Williamson, who will likely make the debate stage along with sitting lawmaker Kirsten Gillibrand and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.

Simply put, it is impossible to imagine the current field or the broader story arc of the Democratic race so far were it not for Trump shattering traditional norms.

2. Cable Is King

Speaking of outdated norms, there was once a president who made it is his signature to boast about his dignified distance from the raucous uproars and obsessions du jour of the modern media cycle. That president was Obama, who struck a superior air while boasting constantly of his indifference to “cable chatter.”

But it is impossible to imagine Obama’s successor becoming president without his fixation with cable television—by many reports he watches several hours daily, and even records his favorite shows—and his mastery over how to manipulate the hyperaccelerated news cycle powered by the social media-cable ouroboros.

When Trump’s rise from noisy celebrity to presidential contender began four years ago, his path was cable—not simply the televised debates of 2015 and 2016, but the way his performances dominated channels for days afterward. Every Democratic presidential candidate, including Biden as front-runner, is acutely conscious of the need to perform well at cable debates starting next month, and along the way to demonstrate that they are capable of competing with Trump on equal terms in the general election battle of media narratives. No Democrat could credibly claim to be indifferent to “cable chatter,” or would regard that as something to boast about.

3. Message Discipline Is for Losers

Not long ago, one of the paramount tests of effective campaigns was “message discipline,” the ability to stay on one’s own themes and avoid getting dragged into the daily rumpus. Operatives worked to make sure their candidate always managed to seem “presidential”—that is, with a certain dignified reserve and detachment from the seamier parts of the business.

To paraphrase Ronald Reagan (“We are the change”) Trump can credibly boast: “I am the rumpus.”

And with the possible exception of Biden, there aren’t any top-tier candidates on the Democratic side laboring to stay above the fray.

This has a substantive component, seen in the way candidates jostle with each other to be first to break from the crowd on questions like whether Trump should be impeached or whether they endorse the “Green New Deal” unveiled by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey. As a Washington Post writer recently noted, it used to be virtually unheard of for presidential candidates to attack corporations and their leaders by name. But following Trump’s lead, Democratic candidates routinely unload on such companies as Amazon, ExxonMobil and Facebook.

The stylistic dimension is even more vivid. Pre-Trump, operatives likely would have worried that Pete Buttigieg’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, was making a spectacle of himself on social media with his free associations about their pet dogs, his Harry Potter obsession, the guy drinking ginger ale next to him on an airline flight, as well as more reflective posts on what the campaign has meant to him. As it is, the candidate’s spouse’s fluency on Twitter makes him an important asset. O’Rourke is mocked in some quarters for livestreaming his haircut, but on balance his willingness to share his fascination with self on social media is considered a good thing. Even Elizabeth Warren is tweeting videos of throwing back beers or greeting her dog.

Trump has firmly set the precedent that if a thought is on his mind it is on his keyboard; even as most Democrats don’t emulate his regular stream of insults they are plainly in debt to his example. Understatement and reserve as signatures of a presidential style are in the past.

4. Deficits Don’t Matter

A few days before Obama was sworn in at his first inaugural, he gave an interview with the Washington Post during which he was at pains to emphasize his commitment to fiscal discipline. He announced a “fiscal responsibility summit” and, expanding on rhetoric from the campaign, said he was determined to address unsustainable costs to entitlement programs like Social Security “under my watch” rather than “kick the can down the road.”

That’s a reminder that even progressive leaders used to feel an obligation to match their appeals for expensive new domestic spending with furrowed-brow professions about how they realized there is a cost to everything. These statements were aimed not so much at conservatives but at moderates within the Democratic Party.

Trump has offered scant evidence rhetorically or substantively that he cares about budget deficits or entitlements costs. This has given Democratic presidential candidates a green light to blow off these questions, too. No top-tier Democrat is emphasizing deficit reduction or cost-control, and they are under no particular pressure from the media or voters to do so. Instead the competition is over who can present the most ambitious and pulse-quickening ideas—‘Medicare for All,’ free college, teacher raises, massive infrastructure investment and so on. That is a change from the environment faced by Hillary Clinton, Obama, John Kerry or Bill Clinton in their turns as nominees, and Democrats have Trump to thank.

5. Being a Uniter Is So Yesterday

Trump did not create the ultrapartisan politics with which he is so associated—this had been building for a quarter-century or more before his election. One difference with him, however, is that most of the time he never pays rhetorical deference to the notion of the presidency as a national unifier.

Every president from George H.W. Bush (“a kinder, gentler nation”) to Bill Clinton (who said he wanted to be “a repairer of the breach”) to George W. Bush (“I’m a uniter, not a divider”) to Obama (“There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; There’s the United States of America”) produced signature lines emphasizing the desire to bridge differences. Hillary Clinton called herself a “progressive who gets things done” by working with all sides.

This kind of rhetoric is largely absent from the Democratic contest. The partial exception, again, is Biden, and he is learning fast about the perils of offering himself as bridge-builder at a time when even many party moderates believe that Trump Republicans are so not on the level there is no point in trying to get along. His statement that Vice President Mike Pence is personally “a decent guy” caused an online uproar on the left and forced Biden to say he didn’t think Pence’s policies or politics were decent.

It was a reminder that Biden, probably more than any candidate, formed his political sensibilities in an earlier era—and long before many Democrats concluded that the right way to beat Trump is by embracing the reality that he has changed the way to run for president.

""If we don't wrestle this monster to the ground now via an impeachment hearing, don't we think the president will be emboldened to again lie, cheat and steal, maybe call in some of his newly acquired friends, Kim Jong Un, MBS [Mohammad Bin Salman], and [Vladimir] Putin, to again help tilt the field in his favor?"" Kirschner asked MSNBC host Ali Velshi.

Kirschner accused Trump of committing campaign finance violations and welcoming Russia's help to gain an edge in the 2016 election.

His comments came as congressional Democrats continued pressing for more information in the Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, for the first time, held a press briefing on his controversial report.

2020 DEM ELIZABETH WARREN PROPOSES LAW SAYING A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED

While Mueller detailed what many saw as troubling efforts by Russians to influence the 2016 election, he said he didn't have enough evidence to conclude that Trump's campaign engaged in a conspiracy with the Kremlin.

Many Democrats, however, have urged impeachment apparently based on Mueller's concerns surrounding potential obstruction of justice.

After Mueller's press briefing, many cable news personalities reportedly suggested Mueller had effectively urged impeachment. “Reading between the lines, Mueller came before the American people today and said, ‘Look, the President is a criminal, and there’s not a damn thing I can do about it,'"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes said."
Mueller’s punt keeps looking worse,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/31/18645173/mueller-report-barr-trump-obstruction,"Robert Mueller’s report makes the stirring claim that “a fundamental principle of our government” is that no person, not even the president, “is above the law.”

But the special counsel’s ultimate legacy may well be the exact opposite — because of his controversial decision not to say whether Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice.

“We concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said in his statement Wednesday, reiterating his report’s explanation.

It was the punt heard around the world. It may have been the crucial turning point in the saga of the special counsel probe, and perhaps the decision most likely to have ramifications for future presidents. It effectively “removes the president from the scope of generally applicable criminal laws,” Cornell law professor Jens David Ohlin recently told my colleague Sean Illing.

Essentially, Mueller has laid out a model that federal prosecutors can investigate the sitting president for crimes, but that they should not make any conclusion about whether he committed a crime. In a sense, this does seem to place the president above the law.

To be clear — this was Mueller’s own choice. Yes, he did conclude that existing department policy prevented him from indicting a sitting president. But before the special counsel wrapped up his work, it was widely believed that he might still issue a judgment on whether Trump committed a crime.

He did not do so, and this “took some constitutional scholars and Justice Department veterans by surprise,” the Washington Post’s Rosalind Helderman wrote Wednesday. Helderman quotes J. Michael Luttig, a former appellate judge and former Justice Department official, saying: “The fact that a president cannot be prosecuted does not foreclose a finding by a special counsel of whether a president committed a crime.”

Oddly, Mueller also went out of his way, both in his report and his statement, to opine that he did not have “confidence” that Trump didn’t break the law. And his legal analyses of certain incidents involving Trump sure seem to suggest he violated the law. But he refused to take the final step and outright come to a conclusion — something Attorney General William Barr has repeatedly said he expected the special counsel to do.

Mueller was also careful never to say that he couldn’t have issued a criminal finding about Trump. In the report, he writes several times that his office “determined” not to do this, and in his Wednesday statement he used the word “concluded.” Additionally, Barr proceeded to ignore this considered decision not to decide, quickly issuing his own conclusion that, in his view, Trump didn’t violate the law.

Still, Mueller’s decision-making around the highest-profile criminal investigation into a president in decades is unmistakably important, and could be viewed as a model for similar future investigations to follow. So we deserve more transparency about how it came about.

Mueller’s reasoning for choosing not to say whether President Trump broke the law

For a report that’s 448 pages long, Mueller’s decision to end his investigation of Trump with a punt is somewhat under-explained.

The special counsel lays it out quickly in the introduction of his report’s second volume. First, he writes, he “accepted” the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel’s 2000 opinion that the department can’t indict a sitting president because it would undermine his capacity to carry out the work of the executive branch. Second, the report continues, the office determined that investigating the president “is permissible” anyway, to preserve evidence, and because the president wouldn’t have immunity from indictment after he leaves office. So far, that’s all as expected.

But then comes the punt. Though the office “considered” whether to evaluate Trump’s conduct under Justice Department standards about prosecution decisions, Mueller writes, it “determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.”

And his main reason is a curious one — that it would be unfair to the president, because the fact that he can’t be charged means he can’t clear his name with an acquittal at trial.

Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, offers no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.

Mueller reiterated this point in his statement Wednesday. “Beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness,” he said. “It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge.” In the report, he refers to this as the “absence of a neutral adjudicatory forum” to review the report’s findings.

Mueller expresses another concern in the report as well — namely, that finding the president committed a crime in an internal report “could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.” Specifically, it could “imperil the President’s ability to govern.”

So, Mueller said in his statement: “We concluded that we would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the president committed a crime. That is the office’s final position.”

Mueller’s move sets a worrying precedent

Even though Mueller made clear this was his own decision, it will inevitably set a precedent for future investigations into presidents — a problematic one.

If Mueller’s approach is taken as a model, the Justice Department can investigate to their heart’s content, but at the end of the day, they not only won’t indict a sitting president, but they won’t even say whether he broke the law.

It’s the very definition of special treatment, and would essentially remove one potential check on presidential wrongdoing from within the executive branch. It would mean the department charged with investigating and charging violations of federal law won’t assess whether one particular person, the president, violated federal law.

Mueller’s concern about “fairness” to the president, who would lack a forum to clear his name after being accused, is particularly odd.

“That is completely absurd,” Ohlin, the law professor, told Illing. “The president doesn’t have a courtroom to vindicate his innocence only because the DOJ has decided that his office makes him immune from indictment in the first place. It’s a piece of circular reasoning that removes the president from the scope of generally applicable criminal laws.”

The special counsel appears to realize the implications of this position, so in an apparent attempt to mitigate it, he does offer an opinion on Trump’s conduct — that it’s, well, not obviously innocent.

“If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller writes in his report’s final paragraph.

Indeed, many who have read the report closely have remarked that its legal analysis often seems quite damning for Trump. Lawfare’s Quinta Jurecic, for example, parsed the report’s language about several examples of Trump’s potentially obstructive conduct, with an eye toward whether it established all three legal elements of criminal obstruction of justice. For four examples, the report seems to do just that. Hundreds of federal prosecutors have also opined that Trump’s conduct as outlined in the report would merit charges if he wasn’t president.

But in the end, Mueller, the person who was charged with investigating whether the president of the United States violated the law, refused to outright make a judgment on whether he did. And if, in the future, Justice Department investigators are looking into a sitting president’s potentially criminal conduct, they might feel obligated to follow his example and do the same, rather than rocking the boat.

This wasn’t the obvious call — and Barr quickly made a different call

Again, Mueller did not conclude that he was prohibited from making a criminal finding about the president. He says he “considered” doing so. It’s just that he concluded that he wouldn’t.

This was far from a foregone conclusion, it certainly came as a surprise to me and others who have covered Mueller’s investigation for years.

Attorney General William Barr, for instance, testified that he was “frankly surprised” to learn this in March and that he “did not understand exactly why the special counsel was not reaching a decision.”

Indeed, Barr proceeded to do exactly what Mueller wouldn’t — evaluating the evidence and concluding that, in his view, it wasn’t sufficient to establish Trump committed a crime. So, in a sense, Mueller’s considered decision not to decide was immediately thrown out the window by his superior.

“The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office,” Barr told CBS News this week. “But he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.”

Mueller may have had other reasons for restraint

Perhaps hanging over all this is the fact that, if Mueller had submitted a report to Barr concluding that Trump committed a crime, it would have initiated a crisis.

Mueller would have been the man who threw the Justice Department into turmoil, as the department would inevitably have struggled with how to handle such an explosive conclusion. (Remember that Barr was not legally obligated to make Mueller’s findings public.)

Once the news inevitably got out, Mueller would likely have become the man who lit the impeachment fuse. Congressional Democratic leaders are having enough difficulty holding off their base’s desire to impeach Trump as it is. An unambiguous conclusion from Mueller that Trump violated the law would have led to pressure that may well have been impossible for them to withstand.

It’s possible Mueller believes that’s a decision that should be made by Congress, not a Justice Department prosecutor. The House of Representatives is essentially the “prosecutor” in the impeachment process — they can vote to kick-start a trial in the Senate. He might have envisioned his job as limited to gathering evidence and presenting some analysis.

But when Mueller’s report does reference impeachment, he seems concerned about interfering with that process. A “criminal accusation against a sitting President,” he writes, could “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” (A footnote there makes clear he means impeachment). So essentially, Mueller has ceded the role of deciding whether the president committed a crime to Congress.

There may also have been features of the case itself that made Mueller prefer restraint. He didn’t establish an underlying conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to interfere with the election. And despite all his troubling obstruction evidence, he lacked an indisputable smoking gun example, like Trump outright telling witnesses to lie to investigators or destroying evidence.

But his decision really deserves more transparency and debate

In the end, Mueller’s decision not to make a criminal finding one way or the other may be the most crucial decision he made during his investigation — and we should really get more transparency about it.

When did the special counsel decide on this approach, exactly? What was the debate over it like? How close was he to going in a different direction? What sort of internal analyses were written on this topic? Was his decision based on the particular circumstances of this case, or would his reasoning apply to all similar investigations? Should the new standard be that the Justice Department never opines on whether the president has violated the law?

It’s understandable that Mueller doesn’t want to testify before Congress about uncharged individuals and uncharged conduct, as per Justice Department practice. But this is a process call that could have major consequences for future investigations of presidents, and accordingly deserves a good deal more review and debate.

Considering how consequential this decision may have been, the few paragraphs about this in Mueller’s report simply aren’t enough — nor are his brief remarks this week. His decision poses the risk that future investigations of presidents will be hamstrung from the start. So he should give a better explanation of why he made this call."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
"Attorney General William Barr on caring about his reputation: ""Everyone dies""",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/william-barr-interview-attorney-general-on-caring-about-his-reputation-everyone-dies-exclusive/,"Looking back on his lengthy career as a top Department of Justice official, Attorney General William Barr doesn't seem fazed by critics questioning his relationship with President Trump and alleging he's not a straight shooter when it comes to interpreting the law. Barr says the attacks on his character stem from a ""hyper-partisan period of time.""

Asked by CBS News' Jan Crawford about concerns over his reputation for defending the president amid ongoing probes into the administration's alleged ties to the Russian government and claims that Mr. Trump obstructed justice, Barr appeared indifferent.

""I am at the end of my career,"" Barr said. ""Everyone dies and I am not, you know, I don't believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?""

More from the CBS This Morning exclusive interview:

Barr, who previously served in the George H.W. Bush administration, is only the second attorney general in history who's served in that capacity twice. The first was back in 1850.

He said he knew it would ""only be a matter of time"" that he would be attacked for what he considers is ""behaving responsibly and calling them as I see them."" He argued ""nowadays, people don't care about the merits and the substance.""

""They only care about who it helps, who benefits, whether my side benefits or the other side benefits, everything is gauged by politics. And as I say that's antithetical to the way the department runs and any attorney general in this period is going to end up losing a lot of political capital and I realize that and that's one of the reasons that I ultimately was persuaded that I should take it on because I think at my stage in life, it really doesn't make any difference.""

When asked if he had any regrets for taking the job, Barr told Crawford: ""No.""

""In many ways, I'd rather be back in my old life but I think that I love the Department of Justice, I love the FBI, I think it is important that we not, in this period of intense partisan feeling, destroy our institutions,"" he added.

Barr says Justice Department and Mueller sparred over ""legal analysis"" in Russia report

Barr meanwhile said his experience with the president has so far been a ""good, professional working relationship"" -- a somewhat stark contrast to the relationship between the president and Barr's predecessor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Mr. Trump repeatedly and publicly lashed out against Sessions during his tenure at the DOJ, stemming from his recusal from the Russia investigation. Barr, however, said the two talk to each other in a direct manner. He told Crawford he doesn't pay attention to the president's social media edicts.

""I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it's President Trump that's shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that,"" Barr defended.

""From my perspective, the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that we have to stop this president, that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring,"" he added."
State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

Interested in LGBT? Add LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

"William Barr dishes on what Huber, Horowitz, and Durham are investigating",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-barr-dishes-on-what-huber-horowitz-and-durham-are-investigating,"Attorney General William Barr gave his clearest explanation yet of the various “investigations of the investigators” being carried out by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS’s Jan Crawford, Barr described what tasks U.S. Attorney John Durham, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber have been assigned regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the DOJ and FBI as they carried it out.

Following pressure from congressional Republicans, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in March 2018 that Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah, had been picked to review any misconduct by the DOJ and FBI. Some Republicans had been calling for a second special counsel.

Huber’s long-running inquiry has long been shrouded in mystery, but Barr revealed Horowitz and Durham have taken over most of his responsibilities.

Barr said “Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance” but that he then “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review.”

Barr said Huber “was essentially on standby” in the event that Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.” That apparently has not been necessary, as Barr said “he has not been active on this front in recent months.” Barr said Durham would now be taking over Huber’s role in handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz and Huber’s involvement with Trump-Russia matters was done.

Sessions had also asked Huber in 2017 to look into issues related to the sale of Uranium One and allegations that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been improperly involved in the process, as well as broader claims of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. Barr seemed to suggest that what evidence Huber found, if any, may soon be revealed.

""The other issues [Huber has] been working on relate to Hillary Clinton” are ""winding down and hopefully we'll be in a position to bring those to fruition,"" Barr said.

[ Also read: William Barr responds to critics of his reputation: 'Everyone dies']

In regards to the DOJ inspector general investigation, Barr said he would not describe Horowitz’s role as small, but rather as very specific. “He’s looking at a discrete area that is, you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page,"" Barr said. Page was a former Trump campaign adviser who was surveilled by the DOJ and the FBI for months beginning in October 2016.

More than a year ago, in March 2018, Horowitz announced the start of the FISA abuse investigation, saying he was doing so following requests from Sessions and Republican members of Congress. GOP lawmakers alleged the DOJ and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign and Trump's administration.

At the time, the inspector general's office said it would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” That “certain U.S. person” is Page.

The DOJ inspector general also said it would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” The “source” is Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose unverified dossier was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants against Page.

Steele has communicated in recent days that he’d be willing to cooperate with Horowitz but not with Durham.

Barr, who has said that Horowitz’s probe should be ending in May or June, called him a “superb government official” in this latest interview, but pointed out that Horowitz “has limited powers.”

“He doesn't have the power to compel testimony, he doesn't have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice,” Barr said. “His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”

That’s why Barr said he selected Durham, a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to head up DOJ’s newest inquiry. Barr was recently given broad declassification authority by Trump, and Durham will have greater investigative powers than Horowitz has at his disposal. Barr praised Durham, saying, “He has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorneys general to investigate these kinds of activities. And he's always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there's no doubt in my mind that he's going he's going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this.”

Barr defended his scrutiny of the actions of the DOJ and FBI in his CBS interview, saying, “I think it's important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country.”

“And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process? Who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done? And was everyone operating in their proper lane?” Barr asked."

CNN reports the IG said that during an unannounced inspection investigators found unsanitary and “standing-room only conditions” at the processing center. One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"
US energy department rebrands gas exports 'molecules of freedom',https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48454674,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has announced its plans to ""spread freedom gas throughout the world""

US energy officials appeared to rebrand natural gas produced in the country as ""freedom gas"", in a statement announcing an increase in exports.

The US Department of Energy said the expansion of a Texas facility meant more ""molecules of US freedom"" could be produced and exported worldwide.

The facility, based in Quintana, produces liquified natural gas (LNG).

The move was a clear indication of US commitment to promoting clean energy, the statement said.

But the rebranding comes amid a Trump administration push to roll back climate change legislation introduced by Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, which targeted vehicle emissions.

Shortly after taking office, Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, saying that he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

The move was decried by climate change scientists and campaigners, and Mr Trump has faced accusations of hampering global efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Wednesday's announced expansion of the facility on Quintana Island will support some 3,000 new jobs in the area, according to the Department of Energy statement.

""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,"" Mark Menezes, the US undersecretary of energy, said.

The term freedom gas is reminiscent of freedom fries, coined in the US 2003 as an alternative to French fries following France's opposition to the US invasion of Iraq.

Republican congressman Walter B Jones and his fellow Republican Robert W Ney also pushed for cafeterias in the House of Representatives to rename their French toast ""freedom toast""."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

"Justice Department opinions take on the force of law — but are not, in fact, the law",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution', 'May At Am']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-opinions-take-on-the-force-of-law--but-are-not-in-fact-the-law/2019/05/30/f4efe222-8280-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html,"The Justice Department issues opinions through its Office of Legal Counsel that have been called “the law that presidents make.” (Amr Alfiky/Reuters)

When former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declared that indicting a sitting president was “unconstitutional,” some legal experts were taken aback. The question has never been litigated and so never decided by the Supreme Court.

The reality, as Mueller said in the same breath — making his first public comments Wednesday on his Russia investigation — is that the prohibition on charging presidents with federal crimes is “long-standing department policy.” It was formulated in two opinions during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

The opinions of this elite corps of lawyers are binding on the federal government — but are not the equivalent of Supreme Court rulings.

[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinion]

For these lawyers are not “umpires,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. once described the role of Supreme Court justices. They are the president’s lawyers, whose stated responsibilities include “facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law.”

The body of opinions they produce have been called “the law that presidents make.”

And it is no surprise that such law holds that presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Friday in a blog post that as president, she would seek a reversal of that Justice Department policy. “When I’m elected, I will exercise my constitutional authority to appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one — not even a President — is above the law,” she said.

While the OLC is proud of its “independent and principled” judgment, a recent Cornell Law Review study of its work, as well as a review of its publicly available decisions, suggests that it has a hard time saying “no” to its chief client.

The yeses accumulate. And because the Supreme Court tends to stay away from separation-of-powers issues, an OLC opinion becomes precedent for the next OLC opinion on the same subject, and the next one and the one after that.

Before long, it’s all settled as far as the Justice Department is concerned.

That’s how White House claims of “executive privilege” have evolved. What began as a few historical examples of withheld information by a handful of presidents and a passing acknowledgment in the Supreme Court’s 1974 Watergate tapes case, U.S. v. Nixon, is now routinely invoked by presidents as fundamental law.

The OLC’s recent opinion supporting President Trump’s barring of House Judiciary Committee testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn is illustrative, citing “nearly five decades” of OLC precedent in support of Trump’s claim.

Similarly, the OLC cited prior opinions and “centuries of historical practice and precedents” in addition to its interpretation of the law, when it determined that Trump could name Matthew G. Whitaker acting attorney general, temporarily replacing Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that Whitaker had held no position confirmed by the Senate.

“Some people have described it as a one-way ratchet,” said Jonathan Shaub, who served in the OLC from 2014 through the summer of 2017. “A president does something. The next president comes along and says, ‘I can do this other thing that’s just a step further.’ ”

The OLC’s precedent, Shaub said, “sets the stage for future presidents, and most favor executive branch authority.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.

Unlike a court, the OLC’s opinion-making process is neither neutral, adversarial nor transparent. Much of its work is kept secret. Some is informal, according to lawyers who have worked there, consisting of emails and purely oral communications.

All this is among the reasons executive branch power keeps expanding, often at the expense of Congress, particularly in areas involving war powers and national security.

On occasion, precedent doesn’t matter so much. The most recent example of that came when the OLC said the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as adviser to the president, did not run afoul of federal nepotism laws.

The decision, dated on Trump’s Inauguration Day, ran contrary to at least four earlier OLC opinions on similar questions.

The office said it had “reexamined the legislative materials” on nepotism. (The federal anti-nepotism law was enacted after Bobby Kennedy served as attorney general to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and did not apply to Hillary Clinton, who served as health-care adviser to her husband, because a court ruled the first lady was a “de facto” White House official.)

The most famous reversal was the revocation by the OLC in 2004 of the “torture memos” authorized by the same office for the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

For a Cornell Law Review article, scholar Adoree Kim compared the OLC’s publicly released decisions advising executive branch agencies with those advising the White House and found a sharp divergence. While the office often felt free to say “no” to agency legal interpretations, it was far more obliging to the White House.

“The OLC is deeply deferential to the President and to presidential action,” she wrote, and “this deference is not unique to times of crisis. It is also not limited to the realm of foreign affairs, or to constitutional questions. Rather, the OLC demonstrates systematic partiality toward the President.” The office, she concluded, is indeed the “president’s law firm.”

But “as a practical matter,” said Walter Dellinger, who ran the office for three years under President Bill Clinton, “it is difficult to cut back on opinions expanding executive power,” though it can and has been done.

Deference to the president “is baked into OLC’s culture,” former OLC lawyer Erica Newland wrote recently in The Washington Post. It “proceeds from the assumption that the president is acting consistent with Article II of the Constitution and with his oath of office, both of which require that he ‘faithfully’ execute the laws.”

“But when I was at OLC, I saw again and again how the decision to trust the president failed the office’s attorneys, the Justice Department and the American people. The failure took different forms,” she wrote. “Sometimes, we just wouldn’t look that closely at the claims the president was making about the state of the world. When we did look closely, we could give only nudges.”

Newland left the office in November. “I decided that the responsibilities entailed in my oath were incompatible with the expectations of my job,” she wrote."

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores, which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."
"Trump vows 'dramatic' action at border, as DHS vows to go after human smugglers",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vows-dramatic-action-border-dhs-vows-human/story?id=63372471,"President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed ""very dramatic"" action to address the refugee crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying he would make a ""big league statement"" later in the day or Friday, but otherwise providing few details on how he planned to up the pressure on his signature and divisive issue.

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official

[Related: DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media]

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

[Also read: DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says]

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"
Elizabeth Warren Wants to Ensure That Sitting Presidents Can Be Indicted for Criminal Activity,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Gideon Resnick'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-ensure-that-sitting-presidents-can-be-indicted-for-criminal-activity,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is proposing changes to Department of Justice policy that preclude presidents from being indicted, following a public statement from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in which he said that very policy effectively prevented him from making a final determination as to whether President Trump broke the law. “Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,” Warren wrote in a Medium post this morning. “And when I’m president, I’ll appoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no president is shielded from criminal accountability.”

She wants Congress to pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict any president of the United States, amend obstruction-of-justice statutes to allow for indictment when the “president abuses the powers of the office,” and appoint an assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel who will reverse OLC opinion arguing that presidents cannot be indicted. Warren was one of the earliest in the field to call for impeachment proceedings last month when the Mueller Report came out."
U.S. Officials Meet in Secret Over Junk-Loan Frenzy as Recession Alarms Flash,https://www.thestreet.com,['Bradley Keoun'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/as-recession-warnings-flash-top-officials-meet-in-secret-over-junk-loan-frenzy-14977371,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday led a secret meeting of top U.S. financial regulators on the risks to global markets from the recent surge in corporate borrowing -- a growing concern as fears mount that the economy might be headed for a slowdown or a recession.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, formed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to prevent a repeat, met ""in executive session,"" or behind closed doors, according to a statement released by the Treasury Department's public-affairs unit following the meeting.

Members of the group include Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as well as the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

No details were provided on the gist of the discussion, though according to the statement the panel heard an ""update"" from Craig Phillips, a counselor to Mnuchin, on recent market developments involving ""corporate credit and leveraged lending.""

Leveraged lending is the financial industry's term for the practice of making loans to companies with poor credit ratings, colloquially known as junk. Historically, the market was dominated by banks, but in recent years investment firms and other non-bank lenders joined in; the outstanding amount of the loans has mushroomed over the past decade to about $1.2 trillion, eclipsing the more-established junk-bond market.

There's also been a surge in borrowing by companies with triple-B ratings, which rank just above junk but could face dire downgrades if an economic slowdown shrinks profits for those borrowers. That category of debt has climbed to an unprecedented level of more than $3 trillion, according to Standard & Poor's, sparking warnings from officials including Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

The concern is that if the economy falters, loan losses would climb dramatically and other companies would be more likely to default on their outstanding bonds.

Minutes from the Financial Stability Oversight Council's March 6 meeting, released Thursday, show that Ted Berg, a Treasury Department researcher, warned panel members that even the non-junk debt could see $300 million to $1 trillion of credit-rating downgrades during the next downturn.

Since then, President Donald Trump's trade war with China has intensified, casting a pall over global markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that the president's new tariffs could add about $800 to the average household's annual costs while hurting business sales and potentially pushing the U.S. into its first recession in a decade.

""Credit stresses are multiplying,"" analysts at Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, wrote last week in a report. ""Reduced risk appetite leads to restricted capital access, which in turn has the potential to set the stage for elevated distress and eventual defaults.""

In recent days, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have slipped below those on shorter-term bills and notes -- an unusual phenomenon known as a ""yield-curve inversion"" since investors usually demand higher returns to compensate for the extra risk that comes with a longer payback period. It's often seen as a classic sign of an impending recession.

The borrowing binge by U.S. companies has garnered so much attention from investors lately that Powell, the Fed chairman, devoted an entire speech to the topic on May 20. He said there's currently a ""moderate"" risk that business debt triggers a full-blown financial crisis, although ""the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens.""

""Once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards,"" Powell said.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a branch of the Treasury Department that supervises national banks, wrote in a May 20 report that ""years of growth, incremental easing in underwriting, risk layering and building credit concentrations result in accumulated risk.""

The corporate-lending surge has been fueled by firms like Blackstone (BX - Get Report) and Apollo Global Management (APO - Get Report) , which rely on junk-grade loans to finance the acquisitions they make through their private-investment funds.

In recent years, the firms have also waded into the corporate-lending business themselves and they now routinely package junk loans into new bonds known as ""collateralized loan obligations,"" or CLOs -- some with pristine triple-A ratings that can be easily sold on to investors with promises of attractive yields.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and declared 2020 presidential candidate, has likened the process to Wall Street's assembly-line-style packaging of subprime mortgages into triple-A rated bonds in the years before the 2008 crisis.

Indeed, with U.S. banks facing tighter scrutiny over the past decade, the private-equity industry has had almost free rein to take over a bigger portion of the financial markets. The five biggest private-equity firms, including Powell's former employer, Carlyle Group, now manage some $1.37 trillion of client money overall, based on a tally by TheStreet.

Mnuchin and other Treasury officials have proposed to exempt these ""non-bank firms"" from getting designated as ""systemically important"" -- a label that would subject them to much tougher oversight. Instead, regulators would supervise the firms' ""activities.""

According to Thursday's statement, the oversight council ""heard a presentation from Treasury staff"" on public comments submitted in response to Mnuchin's proposal.

The presentation wasn't released, but the comments are publicly available on a government website. They include a May 13 letter to Mnuchin from the American Investment Council, the main U.S. trade association for private-equity firms, advocating for the exemption.

Yet there's still powerful opposition -- from the likes of former Treasury secretaries Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew as well as former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.

""Regulation, of course, carries burdens for individual firms, but these consequences have to be measured against the tragic and indiscriminate costs of a crisis,"" they wrote to Mnuchin and Powell in a joint letter, also dated May 13."
USDA moving ahead with reorganization plan opponents argue would 'eviscerate' research units,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/usda-reorganization-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds of professional researchers at the US Department of Agriculture are waiting to hear where outside the Washington area their jobs will be relocated -- part of a drive by Secretary Sonny Perdue to cut costs in the federal bureaucracy that many workers also see as a way to disrupt climate research and other work their bosses disagree with.

The looming changes have triggered unionization drives, with workers in charge of research grants set to vote June 11 on joining the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the major federal workers' unions, after USDA economists voted to join earlier this month.

One watchdog group opposed to the relocation says the relocation is a ""back-door"" way to cut staff at the Economic Research Service (ERS), which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), which oversees the allocation of federal funding for primarily academic research across the country.

""If Secretary Perdue wishes to eviscerate ERS and NIFA research that is opposed by the White House, let him make that case to Congress, rather than hide behind an unjustified, criticized plan to force world class researchers to make the decision to uproot their families or leave their careers,"" Institute for Agriculture and Trade senior policy analyst Steve Suppan said in a statement

The Trump administration has been focused on remaking the federal bureaucracy , triggering a steady outflow of career civil servants. The Environmental Protection Agency's workforce, for example, has decreased by nearly 1,200 employees in the last two years, according to federal data -- many of whom were scientists, according to records obtained by the Washington Post

The ERS and NIFA units have produced research with conclusions that contradict the Administration's talking points, especially on topics like the impacts of climate change on crop or livestock production, or how changes in trade or tax policy, like tariffs or Trump's tax plan, can affect US agriculture. For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper last year that suggested Trump's 2017 tax reform would benefit the wealthiest farmers at the expense of lower-earning farm households , according to the New York Times.

The relocation initiative has brought simmering discontent at USDA to a head. The agency, which handles everything from farm management to school lunches, was among those hit by last winter's record-setting partial federal government shutdown . It has seen the largest drop in employee engagement -- a measure that gauges satisfaction and commitment -- falling 6.9% between 2017 and 2018, the most out of any of the large agencies surveyed, according to an annual government survey.

""These are knowledge-based organizations,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks the federal bureaucracy. ""Employee engagement is directly correlated to performance.""

The USDA says workers will be able to remain in their jobs, but for most, that will mean moving from Washington, DC, to a new location.

Three location finalists -- Indiana, Kansas City or North Carolina's Research Triangle -- were announced earlier this month by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. In addition to the relocation, Perdue plans to move both the ERS and NIFA under the Office of the Chief Economist, a political branch of the department.

The USDA said the only goal is efficiency.

""It's been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government. In our administration, we have looked critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best service possible for our customers, and for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement to CNN. ""In some cases, this has meant realigning some of our offices and functions, or even relocating them, in order to make more logical sense or provide more streamlined and efficient services. None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our ERS or NIFA employees.""

But three longtime agency employees, one from ERS and two from NIFA, told CNN that researchers and economists view the move as an intentional decision to undercut their work. All three employees requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

These workers described a steady flow of coworkers leaving since Perdue's initial announcement about the relocation plans last year, with one saying they are receiving goodbye emails from colleagues at a rate of roughly two per week.

""People who have families are hanging in limbo,"" one of the NIFA employees said. ""Many of the decisions they have to make are based on the school year and they simply can't make those decisions without any certainty.""

The ERS employee said that ERS employees have been told that there will be a limited number of buy-outs and that they will be offered on a first come, first served basis. The rest will have to choose whether to move or quit. They've been told they will receive some kind of assistance with a move, but those details aren't clear.

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that USDA has not yet determined how many people will be offered separation or retirement packages.

""We continue to openly and transparently share information with our employees, stakeholders and Congress,"" the spokesperson added.

Peter Winch, an American Federation of Government Employees representative who helped organize the ERS union, said that the union will try to stop the move and, failing that, will bargain to help make the transition as ""soft as possible.""

Winch said that there are about 225 NIFA staff eligible to participate in the June 11 unionization vote, which covers all professional and non-professional employees. There were 204 ERS staffers eligible to vote earlier this month, Winch said.

According to notes in the USDA budget, there were 350 staff at NIFA and 320 at ERA at the end of 2018.

The relocation plan has drawn opposition from House Democrats , who included language in their budget banning USDA from using funds allocated by Congress to relocate either NIFA or ERS outside the capital. A group of Democratic senators have also introduced legislation that would bar USDA from moving and reorganizing ERS and NIFA

The USDA's inspector general is also investigating whether Perdue has the legal authority to move the agencies.

Former USDA officials and scientific and agricultural associations have also come out against the plan, arguing that it may push trained staff out the door and pose a risk to the agency's independent and objective analysis.

""ERS is ranked as number three in the world of institutions in the field of agricultural economics, a reflection of our leadership in economic research,"" 56 former USDA officials wrote in a letter submitted to Congress . ""This proposal puts a world-renowned research agency at risk and could set back the federal statistical system at a time when the United States should be leading the world in innovation.""

Other agencies within the USDA are also experiencing tumult.

Last week, USDA announced it will cease operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, which help train low-income, rural students on how to respond to national emergencies, and will transfer them to the Department of Labor. Nine out of the 25 centers are expected to close as part of the move, according to the announcement, and a union spokesperson from the National Federation of Federal Employees told CNN that the move will cut more than 1,000 jobs

The ERS employee said that even if the move never happens, damage may already have been done.

""My fear is that the quagmire will continue to bleed us,"" the ERS employee said. ""That's what is so nefarious about all this, just how strategic this feels."""
Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs on all Mexican goods, which have come under criticism from Republicans and business interests.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, she reiterated that the tariffs stemmed from Mexico failing to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the southern border and also blamed Congress: “We just don’t think Mexico’s done enough and Congress has done even less than that.”

Conway also insisted the tariffs do not jeopardize a proposed trade agreement between the US and Mexico, stating: “We are fully confident that USMCA could pass the House.”

Conway did not directly deny a report that the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposes the tariffs. “Ambassador Lighthizer supports the President’s agenda,” she said.

Opinion | Can a Sitting President Be Charged With a Crime?,https://www.nytimes.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/opinion/letters/trump-president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Robert Mueller’s public statement left most with the impression that the president would have been indicted but for the legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. This is enshrined in a Justice Department policy that Mr. Mueller had to follow. But this policy is not based on any provision of the Constitution, any law passed by Congress or any court decision.

The policy flies in the face of the principle that no man is above the law in this country, including the president. That is not just a concept. It is the basis of numerous court decisions such as United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones. No case has decided otherwise.

It is time that the policy that handcuffed Mr. Mueller be revisited and abandoned, or tested in court. Otherwise the only consequence for a criminal president is the impeachment process, which is unlikely today with a Senate controlled by the president’s own party.

I believe that Robert Mueller is wrong in stating that he is precluded by law from offering an opinion on whether President Trump’s acts warrant indictment. He relies on Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinions."
Cuba “Sonic Attack” Mystery: How The State Department Botched Its Investigation,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,"['Dan Vergano', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/havana-syndrome-research-cuba-sonic-attack,"“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said one medical ethicist. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.”

The second time the American diplomat felt the attack was in her apartment kitchen, after a long day working at the US Embassy in Havana. “I felt an extreme pressure like the full, frontal top of my face was exploding off my head.” Unsteady on her feet afterward, unable to work, she was medevaced to Miami and diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. But what caused that injury, and more like it to dozens of other US diplomats and their families? That’s still unknown — and may stay that way due to the way the US State Department began the medical investigation into what happened. “Day to day, we still don’t know how to attribute it,” said the injured diplomat, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve her future chances of working overseas. For the past three years, diplomats working in Cuba have complained of an array of mysterious ailments and symptoms — dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating — that often started with reports of metallic shrieks inside their homes in Havana. Many report long-lasting, perhaps permanent effects. The “Havana syndrome” mystery has been the subject of intense, and public, scrutiny, with much of it focused on the search for some sort of weapon — ultrasound, microwaves, psychology, and even crickets have been offered as explanations. Yet despite intense political pressure, international headlines, sanctions against Cuba, and withdrawal of most US diplomats from Havana, very little still is known about the cause of the “health attacks” as then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson described them in 2017, that affected at least 40 US and Canadian personnel working in the country. The syndrome is now under investigation by the big guns in biomedicine, federal health agencies, and the US National Academies of Science. But public health experts who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the State Department dropped the ball by not opening the investigation earlier to a wider swath of medical experts outside of its immediate sphere.

“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here.”

According to interviews with public health officials and affected personnel, as well as documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via a Freedom of Information Act request that included hundreds of emails exchanged between researchers and the US Navy’s research office, much of the early research into the mystery may have been botched or biased. The initial investigation was confined to two competing sets of researchers, both eager to publish studies on their own work, and whose findings have been at odds with each other. In one case, researchers were also seeking to promote their own newly approved medical device as a diagnostic tool. And until now, the effort has lacked broader oversight by an institution capable of cross-disciplinary research. “The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said medical ethicist Sergio Litewka of the University of Miami, who has written about the political cloud of secrecy and distrust surrounding the diplomats’ injuries. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.” (BuzzFeed has filed a lawsuit with the State Department requesting its communications related to the medical research into the injuries, after the agency denied a request for them on medical privacy and ongoing investigation grounds.) The two medical teams the State Department first tasked with treating victims — one from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the other from the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine — diagnosed the diplomats with injuries centered on their own respective areas of research expertise: inner ear damage and concussions. That drew criticism from other medical experts who saw them and the State Department as embracing familiar theories while closing off other explanations, ranging from viruses to poison to mass psychology. “Medical groups do tend to see what they are used to seeing,” University of Virginia applied ethics professor Deborah Johnson told BuzzFeed News, comparing the situation to the joke about intoxicated people who look for lost keys under a streetlamp because that’s where the light is. “It’s why it is best to hear from a lot of disciplines in an investigation.” Until now only those two US medical teams have reported, inconclusively, on the injuries to 26 US diplomats (and 14 Canadian ones) that began in Havana in late 2016. The US National Academy of Sciences will begin an investigation starting in the next few weeks, consisting of three standing committees of varied specialists investigating for a year. But outside experts are worried it might be too late to crack the case, starting now one year after the last report of injuries in Havana. They also fear that the State Department and other federal agencies have hobbled the medical investigation by keeping the details closed and hidden from the outside world. “The National Academy is an excellent choice, likely to bring in sophisticated scientists with a good arm’s length from the political players,” UCLA neuroscientist Mark Cohen told BuzzFeed News. “I hope that the NAS will also take the step of bringing in experts from outside the US, as well.”

Emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications.

The State Department does not fund medical research but, after the teams from Miami and UPenn failed to reach a consensus, did ask the CDC to investigate the injuries in December 2017. The CDC has not yet published the results of its investigation, more than a year later. The NIH’s brain trauma research, now open to injured diplomats and their families, is a five-year study. “Our response continues to be guided by the medical facts,” State Department senior medical adviser Behzad Shahbazian told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “World-class brain injury specialists and other scientists” at UPenn, NIH, and CDC, he said, “continue to examine the medical data to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of injury that caused these patients’ symptoms.” But according to public records obtained by BuzzFeed News, emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications. (The UPenn team requested copies of their own emails, and then declined to comment on them to BuzzFeed News. The Miami-led team responded after it was presented with a list of incidents in the emails.) The emails show the Miami-led team discussed turning the investigation into a multiyear effort at the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and, more unusual, also looked at the research on the injured diplomats as a marketing opportunity for diagnostic goggles — a medical device that one researcher and his university had a patent application on. (Via a spokesperson, the researcher denied having a financial interest in the patent.) They also worried about “State trying to reclaim ownership” of the investigation, according to their communications, which also privately suggest some saw little chance that the cause of the illnesses that started more than two years ago in Havana would ever be found.

Miami Herald / Getty Images Workers at the US Embassy in Havana leave the building on Sept. 29, 2017, after the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all but essential personnel from the embassy because Cuba could no longer guarantee diplomats’ safety.

In November 2016, the first cases of strange noises and injuries began appearing among a handful of diplomats posted to Havana. Initial reports were of buzzing sounds inside private homes. Embassy security at first thought these were just noises meant to annoy staff, according to US Senate testimony by State Department security official Todd Brown. The erratic nature of the incidents, a few one week, and then none another, added to the confusion, but by February 2017 it was clear that around half a dozen embassy staff were ill with headaches, hearing loss, or vertigo.

From the beginning, the medical investigation into these reports was ad hoc, a side project run by the doctors tasked with diagnosing and treating the diplomats and their families. The research investigation was allowed by the State Department, but not run by it. “I literally got this call, ‘This is the State Department, we have a problem,’” University of Miami medical school otolaryngologist Michael Hoffer told a Pentagon-sponsored presentation last August. “All of these individuals had experienced a loud noise or pressure before and during the symptoms.”

Hoffer, a former Navy doctor with two decades of military experience, had experience with blast victims who sustained traumatic brain injuries during the Iraq War, even receiving funding from the NFL Foundation for his research. Since Miami was the evacuation point for the embassy, it made sense for the State Department to ask the University of Miami expert to look at what resembled head injuries. He and his colleagues examined evacuated staff members with injuries in Miami, giving them neurologic, hearing, and physical exams. He later traveled to Havana to see many more, mostly unaffected personnel. In late March 2017, embassy staff were gathered in Havana by then-ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who warned them about the incidents and said they would be evaluated if they wished. It was the first time many had heard about the injuries or the sounds. According to news reports, Canadian diplomats and their families, including children, also began reporting such ailments that month — including headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and ringing in the ears — from similar sound-linked incidents. (Fifteen Canadians, including five diplomats, sued their country in February, charging that their government “downplayed the seriousness of the situation, hoarded and concealed critical health and safety information, and gave false, misleading, and incomplete information to diplomatic staff."") And the injuries kept coming. “Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound,” the injured American diplomat told BuzzFeed News about the incident in her Havana apartment in April 2017, one month after the embassy town hall. While in her apartment kitchen, “I literally had to duck around a corner to get away from it,” she said.

“Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound.”

Her vision started to blur over the next three days, so she went to a Cuban eye doctor, who diagnosed bleeding in her retinas. “We couldn’t tell the [Cuban doctor] anything,” she said, but the State Department quickly evacuated her as soon as she alerted them about the problem. She stayed in Florida for about six weeks for treatment for her eyes, before returning to Havana “to resume life.” Shortly after her return, there was a second incident in the apartment, accompanied by a buzzing noise. She said, “A sudden force on my face was pulling it up, everywhere above the nose.” Afterward she felt unsteady while walking and had fatigue and difficulty concentrating. She was evacuated to Miami, where she was evaluated for a traumatic blast injury, in the process donning a pair of experimental diagnostic goggles that tracked her eyes to measure the severity of her vertigo, and serving as a data point in Hoffer’s research. (Essentially, the goggles claim to track how the pupils of the eyes constrict in response to seeing objects move back and forth, an involuntary response that people with even mild traumatic brain injuries find difficult.) By April, the University of Miami’s Hoffer had invited his longtime colleagues, bioengineer Carey Balaban of the University of Pittsburgh and Kurt Yankaskas, their grant officer at the US Navy’s Office of Naval Research hearing loss program, to collaborate on investigating the diplomats’ injuries. The three scientists discussed inner ear “cavitation,” damaging implosions of blood bubbles caused by focused sound waves, as an explanation. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Balaban shared a proposal for a “blood vessel” grant with Yankaskas later that same month. Still more diplomats reported injuries. On May 23, 2017, the State Department told Cuba to send two of its diplomats home from its Washington, DC, embassy, unsatisfied with the Castro government’s protests of innocence concerning the injuries. Cuba had a long history of constant surveillance aimed at US diplomats. It was also known to engage in petty harassment, such as leaving unplugged refrigerators and cigarettes in ashtrays after break-ins. It made the notion of the regime lacking any knowledge of the injuries, or responsibility for them, implausible in US eyes. In all, Hoffer’s team would see 25 diplomats or their families affected by the incidents, 10 who lived with them but were unaffected in Miami, and another 105 unaffected personnel seen separately in Havana. “There was no media attention given to what was happening in Cuba when we saw these individuals,” Hoffer said at the later Pentagon teleconference, calling the group “in a sense, pure.” On July 6, 2017, Hoffer and other medical experts met with federal officials, reportedly including top State Department medical officer Charles Rosenfarb, to discuss the still-secret injuries with the diplomats. The expert panel “came to a consensus that the initial findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-natural source,” according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That consensus was perhaps unsurprising, given the experts who were looking under the lamppost: They included neurologists and hearing specialists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, according to a State Department email asking them for travel receipts. But there were no infectious disease, toxicology, tropical medicine, or psychiatric experts listed as meeting specialists — no one who might have had a competing explanation for the injuries was present. Competing theories would, however, come into play much later. Complicating any collaboration, and the research overall, was secrecy about the injuries. This remains a problem today. BuzzFeed News asked the four scientists from Johns Hopkins who were listed as participants in the July 2017 meeting, for example, to comment on the progress of the medical investigation into the Havana injuries so far. A university media representative said that one, otolaryngologist Frank Lin of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, had signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that the rest “can’t comment” for undisclosed reasons. The July 2017 meeting also included neurosurgeon Douglas Smith of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The State Department looked to his Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair, a highly regarded center for the treatment of brain injuries near Washington, DC, where many of the injured diplomats and their families lived, for their extended treatment. “It was good care, they took very good care of us,” the injured diplomat said of UPenn. “They told me, ‘We need to fix you and make you better,’; they would treat us like anyone else who came into their center with our symptoms.” Outside, however, a storm was brewing. On Aug. 9, 2017, in answer to a question from a CBS News correspondent, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that some embassy personnel “reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,” and mentioned the expulsion of Cuban diplomats in May. Headlines quickly erupted of “hearing loss” and “brain damage” to diplomats caused by an “acoustic attack,” all suggestions that outside experts have later found questionable. Cuban state television in October 2017 blamed the noises heard by the diplomats in the incidents on cicadas or crickets, something the diplomat interviewed by BuzzFeed News scoffed at. “I’ve heard cicadas before,” she said. “It sounded different.” In September, another injured diplomat who spoke to BuzzFeed News under similar conditions of anonymity was evacuated from Havana ahead of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the island. He had heard a buzzing noise in his home and the sensation of pressure, followed by problems with vertigo. “I fell out of my chair at work,” he said. He was also evaluated at UPenn, and is back at work now in the US, although he still has trouble concentrating. “I don’t function at the level I did before,” he said, and worries about the long-term effects, especially, he said, in light of the US government’s longtime wrangling with war veterans with unexplained illness tied to Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome.

By the middle of August, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Hoffer’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Balaban was corresponding with Smith about collaborating on a study of how UPenn’s brain images of injured diplomats might explain how ultrasound beams could selectively damage a person’s inner ear from a distance.

“Your data will be very important in narrowing down plausible scenarios,” Balaban wrote in an Aug. 20, 2017, email to Smith. Smith was dubious, asking how ultrasound “can go through air and [a] possible glass pane, then the skull, to selectively affect the brain.” Competition to publish research results first is the lifeblood of US scientific process. But for Havana syndrome, this drive pitted the two medical teams against each other in a race to publish in the world’s two most prestigious medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The fastest team, from UPenn, would submit a paper to a journal within a few weeks of looking at the last diplomats in their study. By November 2017, Hoffer and Balaban were drafting a paper on the diplomats that they had seen, which they planned to submit to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales by Pittsburgh-based Neuro Kinetics Inc. of the diagnostic goggles that Hoffer used to assess the diplomats’ injuries. Along with his university, Balaban had applied for a patent on the goggles with Neuro Kinetics. They shared the news with Yankaskas, their US Navy ONR grant officer:

BuzzFeed News

“It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or similar inner ear concussion,” said a December 2017 update of the draft paper, obtained via FOIA request. It compiled symptoms that ranged from ringing ears to foggy thinking to dizziness, all signs of inner ear damage, to come to this conclusion. Such symptoms were hallmarks of the blast damage to the head that the medical team had seen and diagnosed during the Iraq War. Those investigations, too, were not without controversy. The Defense Department’s inspector general in 2011 released a report critical of research that Hoffer and Balaban had conducted on US soldiers at Camp Al Taqaddum, Iraq, who were injured by explosions from 2008 to 2009. “Neurological assessments did not adhere to clinical practice guidelines” for mild traumatic brain injury, the report found. It also said that a “potential financial conflict of interest” in the experimental antioxidant tablets was not revealed to the injured personnel in the study, a research ethics violation. (Hoffer held patents on a method of administering the tablets.) A US Navy representative told Time, “The evidence suggests that no physical harm was caused by the administration of the investigational drug,” after the report came out. To close out 2017, the State Department asked the NIH to investigate the diplomats’ injuries — a move the top Republican and Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called for on Dec. 5 — with staff members quoted as critical of the medical investigation.

AFP Contributor / AFP / Getty Images Reflection of the US Embassy in Havana, Oct. 3, 2017.

In January 2018, the journal JAMA notified Balaban and Hoffer that the UPenn doctors had submitted their paper and added them as coauthors. The notice led to an angry face-off between Smith and Balaban, who wanted to see the data and delay publication of the JAMA paper. He told Smith he had complained to ethics officials at the University of Pittsburgh, which posed the threat of a scientific misconduct investigation. (University of Pittsburgh’s communications office did not respond when asked if there had been an outcome of that complaint.)



BuzzFeed News “In or out” email from Smith to Balaban, Feb. 9, 2018.

JAMA released the UPenn study online less than a week after Smith told Balaban he was either “in or out,” without him or Hoffer as authors. The study of 21 people, 11 women and 10 men, concluded “they had sustained injury to widespread brain networks,” a constellation of symptoms similar to concussions caused by physical impacts. “Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened,” UPenn’s Randel Swanson, the lead author on the study, then told BuzzFeed News.

Other experts weren’t so certain. Neuroimaging expert Arthur Toga of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California told BuzzFeed News the study was “inconclusive,” noting its MRI results didn’t indicate anything grossly wrong with the diplomats’ brains that corresponded to their symptoms. Neuroscientist Sergio Della Sala of the University of Edinburgh said that the study’s standard for brain damage, seen in only two or three patients, was so loose as to describe roughly 40% of the general population as having brain damage.

“Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened.”

The JAMA study authors noted that privacy and secrecy restrictions precluded the release of some of the data about the injured diplomats, noting that only Smith and Swanson were responsible for the data. Nonetheless, they ruled out a viral cause of the injuries, because no one had reported a fever, and called poisoning unlikely to have worked so quickly after the sounds heard by 18 of the 21 patients, some of them on the island for less than 24 hours before reporting symptoms. It also ruled out a mass psychology or “functional” disorders, triggered by everything from whiplash to migraines, because the diplomats wanted to return to work and didn’t show signs of “malingering.” This last conclusion is at odds with how “psychogenic” injuries actually work — people suffer physically from injuries triggered by stress in such cases, often with symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and the others reported in some of the Havana cases. They do not fake injury to get time off work. Despite the presence of neuropsychologists on the UPenn team, the description called into question how well the JAMA study authors had really investigated the possibility of psychology to explain the injuries, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew, coauthor of Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. Four days after the study appeared in JAMA, the State Department’s Rosenfarb gave Balaban and his colleagues authorization to publish their own paper in submission with the New England Journal of Medicine. “My apology for the delay,” said Rosenfarb. They had lost the high-prestige publication race, and the delay hadn’t helped, according to an April 2018 email from Balaban. “An NEJM editor has asked us for rights of a first look before the JAMA paper was published. Our release occurred after the JAMA on-line edition appeared,” he wrote to a University of Pittsburgh publicist planning a news conference with the University of Miami’s medical school on publication of their paper, now under consideration by the journal Frontiers in Neurology. Plans for the press conference included a presentation of the Neuro Kinetics goggles that the paper described as able to uniquely diagnose people with the Havana injuries, as well as setting up advance interviews with the Miami Herald and the New York Times. A draft of the paper in review with Frontiers lists no financial conflicts of interest in the study.

BuzzFeed News A University of Pittsburgh email from Balaban, April 17, 2018.

That seems troublesome to neurologist Mitchell Joseph Valdés-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center, a leader on a Cuban panel that concluded in 2017 that the injuries were likely caused by mass hysteria. “There could be a conflict of interest, and that could have [led] to confirmation bias,” he told BuzzFeed News by email. “Their hypothesis could have been that they were going to find evidence of vestibular [inner ear] damage, which is what the [Neuro Kinetics] helmet measures.”

In response to this concern, University of Pittsburgh media relations director Joe Miksch told BuzzFeed News by email, “Balaban has not and will not receive any financial benefit from Neuro Kinetics or the sales of the Neuro Kinetics diagnostic goggles, even if the patent is granted.” He did not answer whether Balaban’s employer, the university, which owns intellectual property on the patent and can license the invention, would financially benefit from the goggles. The university has not entered into any license with Neuro Kinetics, according to Miksch. The last report of a US diplomat injured in Havana came one year ago, in May 2018. Cuba’s foreign ministry said the US State Department had informed it that a woman had “reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her place of residence.” That same month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported that two US diplomats in China reported the same sort of illness “entirely consistent” with the past Cuban cases, prompting the State Department to launch a task force with the Health and Human Services and Energy departments to investigate. (Eventually 15 US diplomats from China would be investigated for such incidents, with the Associated Press later reporting that 14 of them were ruled out from suffering the syndrome, with the 15th inconclusive.) In August, a series of letters critical of the JAMA study were published in that journal, written by a mixture of neurologists critical of the brain damage claims, and experts in “functional” disorders triggered by stress who blasted its dismissal of psychology as an explanation.

“Research with this patient cohort was not originally anticipated due to secrecy and privacy concerns,” Smith and his colleagues said in response to the letters. They restated the criteria for “neuropsychological impairment” and wrote, “we are performing advanced neuroimaging studies of the patient cohort, hoping to identify structural brain changes that may underlie the neurological manifestations.” These studies have still not been published. As mentioned, after asking to see the public records of communications released to BuzzFeed News, Smith did not reply to requests for comment. “I can only vet the (published) cognitive data, and these do not hold water,” Della Sala, the editor of the journal Cortex, told BuzzFeed News by email. “These further explanations made things even worse.” Also unpublished was the submitted Frontiers in Neurology paper by Hoffer’s team. The next appearance of their results instead came in August in talks at a “SOFWERX” Defense Department think tank in Tampa, where Hoffer discussed the injuries suffered by the diplomats. Balaban described the “Frey effect” in his talk, the production of clicking noises in the ears by exposure to microwaves, a phenomenon researched in the 1970s. “So, the ability of radiofrequency to affect the nervous system is real,” he said.

Balaban also touted the Neuro Kinetics goggles at the talk, claiming a 90% ability to tell Havana subjects apart from either blast victims or healthy people. “This is a fieldable technology,” he said.

“The promotion of the silly goggles is a shameless attempt at commercial promotion,” said Cohen, the UCLA neuroscientist. Little more than a week after Hoffer’s Tampa appearance, the New York Times published a story citing the Frey effect and suggesting that microwaves were the prime suspects as the technology that hurt the diplomats, with an endorsement of the idea from UPenn’s Smith. This caused some suspicion on both Hoffer’s and Balaban’s part that their August presentation had been eavesdropped upon and their ideas pilfered (in reality, a University of California, San Diego, news release had touted the idea a few days ahead of the story).

BuzzFeed News Email from Hoffer, Sept. 2, 2018.

“I think State trying to reclaim ownership [is] a strong possibility because we noted that the Penn group (which is a group entirely composed of clinicians) now is convince[d] this is microwaves,” Hoffer wrote in a Sept. 2 note to Balaban and Georgetown University neuroethicist James Giordano, another colleague. “Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.” The group discussed arguing for the Office of Naval Research, instead of the State Department, to lead an investigation into a “multi-layer” plethora of various kinds of energy beams causing the Havana injuries. They also discussed dropping a “red herring” as part of a “misinformation” campaign at their next talk, scheduled for later that week at a Pentagon-sponsored teleconference.

(As mentioned, BuzzFeed News has filed a lawsuit with the State Department for public records of Hoffer’s communications on his research.) “There was no misinformation campaign,” Hoffer told BuzzFeed News by email. The “red herring” was a symptom to distinguish real Havana syndrome patients from pretenders, he said. “Indeed, we have seen patients who present themselves as such.”

“Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.”

When asked about the context of the email suggesting the State Department was trying to reclaim ownership, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine media relations director Joanna Palmer replied, by email, “Dr. Hoffer has no further comment.” Meanwhile, outside experts threw cold water on microwaves, calling the Frey effect wildly implausible as an explanation for the injuries, since its inner ear clicking noises it caused were far too weak to damage tissues. “Maybe Fidel Castro is subjecting them to an ESP attack from beyond the grave,” said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster to BuzzFeed News, when shown the discussion of the “multi-layered” radiation attack idea. Foster, who has no affiliation with UPenn’s medical school team, first described the mechanism behind the clicking effect in 1974, but is dubious it is in play in Cuba. “Unless there is some independent evidence for an exposure of some kind, one could speculate endlessly.” Nevertheless, the Pentagon teleconference received press coverage, noting Balaban’s theory of some confluence of radiation and ultrasound perhaps triggering targeted cavitation in the inner ears of the injured diplomats. “I do not believe that we are close to claiming victory. In fact, I doubt that we can identify ‘the source’ for Cuba,” Balaban wrote to ONR’s Yankaskas in the aftermath of the news coverage. In the outside world, skepticism abounded about both mystery noise-making secret weapons and the diagnoses of the research teams. On Oct. 8, 2018, a neuroscience reporter from another news outlet contacted Yankaskas at ONR, for example, asking whether they could discuss “wildly implausible” ideas that Balaban had presented, and questioned whether he had a “proprietary interest” in the diagnostic goggles. Yankaskas forwarded the interview request to Balaban the same day, writing: “He’s the same reporter that I mentioned this morning.”

EPA finalizes plan to expand ethanol use,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-finalizes-plan-expand-ethanol-gasoline-summer/story?id=63397761,"Gasoline that contains a higher percentage of ethanol should be available to drivers around the country this summer, the Trump administration announced Friday.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to lift limits on the amount of ethanol in gasoline, saying it will expand the market for biofuels and generate a win for corn producers. Industry groups also said it will help the biofuel industry and give consumers more options at the pump.

“As President Trump promised, EPA is approving the year-round sale of E15 in time for summer driving season, giving drivers more choices at the pump,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release.

Trump said he would ask for the change at a campaign rally last March, months before the midterm elections. Expanding ethanol is seen as a way to boost markets for corn produced in Midwestern states and benefit political candidates that support expanded ethanol production.

The head of EPA’s air office, Bill Wehrum, said the proposal helps support renewable fuels and addresses concerns from the oil industry about the regulation of biofuels.

Gerry Broome/AP, FILE

The EPA originally set limits on gasoline with 15% ethanol because of concerns the higher temperatures in the summer could lead to more air pollution. But Wehrum said he doesn't expect a noticeable impact because gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold in the summer months.

""At the end of the day from an environmental standpoint this doesn't make any significant difference,"" he told reporters Friday.

Critics see the decision as an attempt by Trump to help farmers in the Midwest who have been hurt by the trade war with China and declining commodity prices. Corn growers have called for the administration to allow more ethanol and have opposed waivers from oil refineries exempting them from requirements to include a minimum amount of ethanol.

#E15YearRound is welcome news from the @EPA. @NationalCorn President Lynn Chrisp: ""We thank President Trump for following through on his promise to rural America and @SecretarySonny and supporters in Congress for their outspoken commitment to year-round E15."" pic.twitter.com/lQVuuOK9e8 — National Corn (NCGA) (@NationalCorn) May 31, 2019

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also applauded the decision in a statement, saying it will help farmers and consumers while the administration looks to grow the market for American-produced ethanol both in the U.S. and in other countries.

Many farmers are facing historic delays in planting corn crops due to severe flooding. Other efforts to help struggling farmers in states impacted by natural disasters have stalled in Congress."
Book review of Siege: Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Ryan Lizza'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-trip-inside-trumpworld-and-inside-the-presidents-head-with-bannon-as-guide/2019/05/29/7560ec12-8236-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html,"Steve Bannon served as White House chief strategist before being fired in August 2017. He hasn’t talked to President Trump since then, but he still has lots to say about his former boss. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Ryan Lizza is a senior political analyst for CNN and chief political correspondent for Esquire.

The author’s note that opens “Siege,” Michael Wolff’s sequel to “Fire and Fury” — which documented President Trump’s first year in office, much of it through the anonymous musings of Steve Bannon — reads like the scene-setting crawl at the start of a Star Wars movie. The reader learns that Wolff’s new account begins in February 2018, when the “president’s capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and methodical institutional response” and Trump’s “own government, even his own White House, has begun to turn on him.” Instead of cutting to Hoth, the distant ice planet in “The Empire Strikes Back” that’s home to the struggling rebellion, we soon cut to Bannon’s kitchen table.

Bannon has been driven out of the White House by Trump and dumped by his financial patrons, the Mercers. He has set up shop in a shabby Capitol Hill townhouse, theatrically known as the Embassy, which, it slowly becomes clear, might as well be Hoth. It takes 193 pages, but we eventually learn that Bannon hasn’t talked to Trump since he was fired.

That doesn’t prevent Wolff from centering the entire narrative on the president’s former aide. So the new Wolff book is much like the last one: a sail through the Trump diaspora and inside the president’s head with Bannon as the cruise director. But also like the last book, “Siege” is ultimately crippled by three flaws: Wolff’s overreliance on a single character, and one who is now more distant from the action; factual errors that mar the author’s credibility; and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable.

For long stretches of “Siege,” Trump and the White House staff disappear and the reader is subjected to a tedious ticktock of Bannon’s travels and his plotting from the Embassy, where he pontificates throughout 2018 about how the Republicans will win the midterms (they didn’t), how his nationalist project is still ascendant in the GOP (it isn’t), how Robert Mueller will destroy the Trump presidency (he didn’t), and how Bannon himself may have to replace Trump and run for president in 2020, with Sean Hannity as his running mate (we’ll have to wait for Episode III).

In the acknowledgments, Bannon is the only named source whom Wolff thanks, praising him effusively and, in an allusion to Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” calling him “the Virgil anyone might be lucky enough to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld.” In reality Bannon is more like Wolff’s Farinata, the former Florentine political leader whom Dante portrays as banished to the circle of hell for heretics, where, alone in his tomb, he still obsesses about his own era in politics but has no access to current events unless one of the dead brings him a snippet of news from the center of power.

In “Siege,” the dead arrive at Bannon’s doorstep in the form of former Trump aides such as Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, Sam Nunberg and Jason Miller, and Wolff, like many other Washington reporters, absorbs a mix of gossip, misinformation and occasional insight that the outer rings of Trump advisers are famous for circulating.

This rogues’ gallery of Trump hangers-on that Wolff seems to depend on is sometimes presented as a group of devoted ideological rebels trying to keep the flame of true MAGA alive. According to Wolff, several of them, usually working through Hannity, who has better access to the president, press Trump on issues like building the border wall or declaring a national emergency over immigration. Bossie and Lewandowski “weren’t operatives, they were believers,” Wolff credulously reports, a statement that will generate guffaws among Republicans. But mostly, Bannon’s knitting circle is involved in low-level score-settling — often against then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner — and making money off their association with Trump. Lewandowski and Bossie hawk a conspiracy book about the “deep state” even though, according to Wolff, Bannon tells their ghostwriter that “none of this is true.”

Wolff’s rebels and Trump are co-dependent but clear-eyed about each other. Trump, Wolff writes, likes Lewandowski more than his own sons, even though he derides him as an “ass kisser.” Trump says Bossie, who unsuccessfully maneuvers to become chief of staff, is “shifty.” Nunberg is mocked by the president for living with his parents, and Wolff quotes Trump remarking of Miller, “I get the people who no one else wants.”

Likewise, they have no illusions about Trump. Wolff summarizes the view of the president from the ragtag Embassy team: Trump is a “clown,” an “idiot” and a “nutter.”

Bannon’s core political project of attaining power by stoking racial resentment is left uncriticized by Wolff. (In case there is any doubt about this, Bannon tells Wolff: “If you voted for Trump, every picture of a Mexican immigrant, a parent or a child, together or apart, reconfirms that vote.”) Wolff’s obsession with documenting Bannon’s every thought, while remaining uninterested in the reality of the racial politics unleashed by him and Trump, reaches peak hilarity when he earnestly quotes Bannon’s dissection of whether the president is an anti-Semite (probably not) or a racist (probably). While many who have studied Trump — for a fraction of the time that Wolff has — have easily made up their minds on the issue, Wolff, who quotes Trump making racist and anti-Semitic remarks and calling Mexicans “wetbacks,” writes that whether he is a racist or not is “a rosebud riddle.”

However, Bannon’s frequently shrewd observations make it clear why Wolff finds him irresistible. The author is mostly interested in Trump’s psychology. He is adept at documenting the president’s lunacy, and Bannon is frequently an able fellow shrink. For example, he credibly theorizes that Trump’s inevitable disgust with anyone who works for him is a natural outgrowth of his alleged self-hatred. “Hating himself, he of course comes to hate anyone who seems to love him,” Bannon tells Wolff. “If you seem to respect him, he thinks he’s put something over on you — therefore you’re a fool.”

But the idea that Wolff is documenting some larger ideological struggle in the Trump GOP is mostly familiar Bannon spin. According to Wolff, Lewandowski reports that “he had almost wet himself” during a White House confrontation with Kelly, a former Marine, who grabbed Lewandowski by the collar outside the Oval Office. What Wolff leaves out about this well-known episode, first reported by the New York Times, is that Kelly was yelling at Lewandowski for trying to profit off Trump’s presidency. Wolff also ignores, perhaps because of his publishing deadline, that Bossie was officially excommunicated from Trumpworld in May when the Trump campaign suggested he was running a “scam group” that was “interested in filling their own pockets with money from innocent Americans’ paychecks.” Believers indeed.

Wolff’s broad conceptual error — that the real heart of Trumpism is heroically being kept alive by Bannon’s band of true-believing outsiders — would be forgivable if the book wasn’t marred by two more strikes: some cringeworthy errors, and sourcing that renders the extremely fun and juicy quotes sprinkled across every chapter as, sadly, difficult to trust.

Wolff reports that he had two fact-checkers assigned to the book, but they apparently weren’t enough. He writes that after Ty Cobb left the White House, Trump’s only lawyers were Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani (whom he describes as “drunk on a bid for further attention, or just drunk”). Wolff seems not to know that Trump hired Jane and Martin Raskin, whose names do not appear in the book, to deal with the Mueller probe. He writes that Russians hacked the email account of John Podesta and servers at the Democratic National Committee after July 27, 2016, the day Trump famously called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails. That’s wrong. The Podesta hack happened in March, the DNC hack happened in April, and the fruits of those hacks had already been released, which is why Trump made the comment.

Wolff observes that reporting on Trump is difficult because the president and many of the people who work for him or advise him lie indiscriminately. Other reporters have faced this dilemma by maximizing the number of sources needed to confirm the many rumors that swirl around Trump and by generally increasing transparency to retain reader trust in an environment where the president regularly attacks truthful reporting as fake.

Wolff takes a different approach. Dramatic scoops are plopped down on the page with no sourcing whatsoever. Would-be newsmaking quotes are often attributed to Trump and senior officials without any context about when or to whom they were made.

Wolff clearly relies on the work of dozens of other reporters on the Trump beat, but because he rarely uses any attributions, the reader never knows whether a fact he’s relaying comes from him or elsewhere. For example, he writes that Kushner was briefed by intelligence officials that his friend Wendi Deng might be a Chinese spy. The reader would be forgiven for thinking this was another Wolff scoop, rather than a major exclusive reported by the Wall Street Journal in early 2018.

The cutting comments Wolff attributes to Trump certainly sound like the president: “the stupidest man in Congress” and a “religious nut” (Mike Pence); “gives me the creeps” (Karen Pence); “feeble” (John Kelly); “a girl” (Kushner); “looks like a mental patient” (Giuliani); “a pretty stupid boy” who “has too many f---ing kids” (Donald Trump Jr.); “men’s shop salesmen” (Republican House candidates); “ignoramuses” (Trump’s communications team); “the only stupid Jew” (Michael Cohen); “a dirty rat” (former White House counsel Donald McGahn); a “virgin crybaby” who was “probably molested by a priest” (Brett Kavanaugh); “the poor man’s Ann Coulter” (Kellyanne Conway); “sweaty” (Stephen Miller). But the lack of sourcing transparency and footnotes does not inspire confidence.

By far the biggest scoop in the book is a document that Wolff alleges is a draft indictment, eventually ignored, of the president from inside the special counsel’s office. In addition to the alleged indictment, Wolff reports on several interesting and newsworthy memos outlining Mueller’s legal strategy for what to do if Trump pardoned Michael Flynn or tried to shut down the investigation. These documents, if verified, would rescue the book, because they offer the first real glimpse inside the nearly airtight Mueller operation.

On Tuesday, the special counsel’s office issued a rare on-the-record statement insisting that the “documents described do not exist.”"
US 10-year yield collapses to 2.13% as Trump's surprise Mexico tariffs stoke recession worries,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/us-bonds-fresh-trade-tensions-and-recession-fears.html,"U.S. government debt yields added to steep May declines on Friday after President Donald Trump's new tariff threats on all Mexican imports took investors by surprise and aggravated an already-stressed U.S. trade outlook.

At 4:07 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was lower at around 2.135%, off a fresh 20-month low around 2.125% hit earlier in the session. A portion of the yield curve remained inverted as the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill held at 2.351%. The 2-year rate dropped 13 basis points to 1.926%, it's lowest level since January 2018.

The 10-year German bund yield hit a low of -0.213%, its lowest level ever back through records that began in 1988.

The flight to safety on Friday came after Trump said the night before that he will impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if Mexico didn't take unspecified steps to shore up the border, potentially undermining the recently negotiated deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

""While the essential ingredient to the overnight rally is unquestionably the President's threat of tariffs on Mexican goods unless illegal immigration is stopped, the broader backdrop is equally as supportive for Treasuries,"" Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in an email.

""The ongoing policy quandary of 'what will it take to get the Fed to cut?' has been complicated by the gradual nature of the stock selloff which has kept equity volatility, and therefore the tightening in financial conditions, relatively tame,"" he added. ""Nonetheless, financial conditions are at the tightest level seen since January and the pace of the move is comparable to December.""

Trump's Mexico tariffs also represent the White House's latest attempt to pressure an economic partner through the use of trade levies, a tactic Trump has relied on throughout his negotiations with China. The administration imposed 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports earlier this month following a breakdown in talks between Beijing and Washington.

The stall in U.S.-China talks triggered — in addition to the more expensive imports — a paradigm shift in Wall Street's upbeat markets and economic outlook. Traders who had been betting on a lukewarm to positive resolution with China punished risk assets like equities in favor of safer assets like U.S. Treasurys, sending the prices of debt higher and yields lower.

The S&P 500 — down 6.5% this month — tracked a 34-basis-point drop in the 10-year Treasury rate, which in turn inverted a portion of the yield curve. Such inversions are often seen as a recession indicator as those who buy debt from the U.S. government for years are compensated with poorer rates than those who loan money for a matter of months.

The difference between the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at -21.8 basis points. The spread between the 10-year yield and the 2-year yield remained at a positive, albeit flattish 21 basis points.

But while market focus on Friday centered on Trump's latest tariffs, other bond strategists noted what the larger change in outlook could mean for the Federal Reserve. A growing number of investors now expect the Fed to cut its overnight lending rate later in 2019 as the boost from Trump's tax cuts gives way to mounting trade disputes and weaker economic data overall.

""At the beginning of the year, I said that the 10 year was heading to a 2.25% yield, in my opinion, and maybe even through that. I now believe we are heading to a 2.00% yield for the 10 year Treasury,"" Mark Grant, chief global strategist of fixed income at B. Riley FBR said in an email.

Chair Jerome Powell said in March 2018 that ""there's no thought that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook,"" has in recent months tweaked his rhetoric, especially around Europe and China. Twelve months following those first comments on the Trump administration's trade tactics, Powell said that the weaker overseas outlook is dampening domestic growth estimates.

""Much discussion is made of this suggesting a Recession is forthcoming but that is not my take,"" Grant added. ""The Fed, for its own portfolio, has not bought Treasury Bills, a policy that I think will be reversed, and then the Yield Curve will begin to normalize as the Fed's assets include the shorter end of the Curve."""

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
Barr rips 'legal analysis' in Mueller report: 'It did not reflect the views of the department',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-says-he-didnt-agree-with-the-legal-analysis-in-mueller-report-says-it-did-not-reflect-the-views-of-doj,"Attorney General Bill Barr said in an interview that aired Friday that he does not agree with ""a lot of the legal analysis"" inside Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and said it does “not reflect the views” of the Justice Department, the latest break between President Trump's attorney general and leader of the Russia probe.

In a sit-down interview with CBS News’ Jan Crawford, Barr was asked about the handling of his initial four-page summary of Mueller’s report, which he shared in late March. Barr and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said they determined that the evidence found in Mueller’s probe was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

BARR SAYS HE 'PERSONALLY FELT' MUELLER COULD HAVE REACHED DECISION ON OBSTRUCTION

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis, a lot of the legal analysis in the report,” Barr said. “It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the viewpoint of a particular lawyer or lawyers, so we applied what we saw was the right law.”

Speaking of Mueller's findings on obstruction, Barr said, “The bottom line was that Bob Mueller identified some episodes. He did not reach a conclusion. He provided both sides of the issue. And his conclusion was he was not exonerating the president, but wasn’t finding a crime either.”

Barr’s comments come after Mueller made a rare public appearance this week—his first and only in his tenure as special counsel. Mueller announced that the investigation was officially complete and that he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

Mueller detailed the findings of the report, stating that there was “no evidence” of a conspiracy related to Russia colluding with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, and explained his investigatory decisions related to his inquiry on whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said Wednesday at the Justice Department. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and added that “charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider.”

“We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said. “That is the office’s final position.”

But Barr told CBS News that he felt Mueller could have come to an official conclusion on the inquiry.

“I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” Barr said. “The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision whether it was criminal activity, but he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained.”

MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WITH A CRIME WAS 'NOT AN OPTION' IN RUSSIA PROBE

Barr added: “I am not going to argue about those reasons but when he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as heads of the Department to reach that decision.”

This week, Mueller also said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.” Some on the left took that as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

When asked if he thought Mueller was suggesting Congress could be the “venue” to hold the president accountable, Barr said he was “not sure.”

“Well, I’m not sure what he was suggesting,” Barr said in in the interview. “You know, the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crime as an adjunct to Congress.”

Barr also responded to Mueller’s announcement this week that, despite negotiations with top congressional committees, he does not plan to testify in public or private.

“It’s up to Bob, but I think the line he’s drawing, which is he’s going to stick to what’s in the report, is the proper line for any department official,” Barr said.

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. In turn, the president asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect those files from release.

Despite the criticism of Barr over his handling of the report, Mueller defended him on Wednesday, saying that he does ""not question the attorney general's good faith"" in the decision to release the report in full, with redactions, to the public and Congress. Mueller said that he had suggested only ""portions of the report be released,"" and said that he ""appreciated"" Barr's decision.

Meanwhile, Barr, also has fallen under intense scrutiny over his testimony last month before a congressional committee when he said he believed that ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

Barr, since, has appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.

When asked about his use of the word ""spying,"" Barr said: ""I mean, I guess it's become a dirty word somehow. It never has been for me. I think there's nothing wrong with spying. The question is always whether it's authorized by law.""

He added: ""It's part of the craziness of the modern day, that if the president uses a word, then all of a sudden it becomes off bounds. It's a perfectly good English word and I'll continue to use it.""

Barr's review of the origins of the original Russia investigation at the FBI comes amid several other investigations--specifically led by the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Horowitz, for over a year, has been investigating alleged misconduct related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants-- a probe that is expected to be complete by late next month. Durham, though, is cooperating with Durham, FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel.

But last week, the president signed a memo to declassify documents related to the 2016 surveillance of Trump campaign officials. It is unclear what the documents contain, or when they will be declassified.

""I had a lot of questions about what was going on, and I assumed I'd get answers when I went in, and I have not gotten answers that are at all satisfactory and in fact, probably have more questions,"" Barr told CBS News. ""Some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened.""

He added: ""That's all I really will say. Things are just not...jibing."""
U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'May At Pm']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

Natural Gas Is Now Being Referred to as 'Freedom Gas' by The US Department of Energy,https://www.sciencealert.com,"['Grace Panetta', 'Business Insider']",,,,https://www.sciencealert.com/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-natural-gas-as-freedom-gas,"A Tuesday press release from the Department of Energy authorizing new natural gas exports referred to the gas as ""freedom gas,"" a signal of how the Department views domestic natural gas production as a tool to spread prosperity and liberty.

The release announced the Department's approval of new foreign exports of natural gas from a terminal owned and managed by natural gas company Freeport LNG located on Texas' Quintana Island.

""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,"" Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes said in a statement included in the release.

Later on in the release, Steven Winberg, who serves as the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy, additionally characterised the gas as ""molecules of freedom.""

""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world,"" he said.

Domestic natural gas production has boomed in recent years, largely thanks to the uptick in hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"" of gas contained in shale rock formations, with Texas leading the pack. US domestic natural gas production hit an all-time record-high rate in 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Energy Secretary and former Texas Governor Rick Perry has frequently characterised US natural gas as a mechanism to spread economic prosperity and freedom, but Tuesday's release marked the first time a US energy official used the term ""freedom gas"" interchangeably with natural gas, according to Politico energy reporter Ben Lefebvre.

At the 2018 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Perry framed the recent boom in US production as a way for European nations to reduce their dependence on oil from the Middle East, as well as strengthen the US-European alliance.

""We're exporting to our allies in Europe the opportunity to truly have a choice of where do you buy your energy from. That's freedom. And that kind of freedom is priceless,"" Perry said in an interview with Fox Business, calling it the ""most dynamic shift"" in the energy environment ""since World War II,"" according to The Hill.

""There's no strings attached when you buy American. So that's world-changing,"" Perry added.

"Sterigenics created cancer risk 10 times higher than federal EPA standards in Willowbrook, new report says",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-epa-cancer-risks-20190529-story.html,"Ethylene oxide emitted by Sterigenics continued to pose high cancer risks after the company installed new pollution-control equipment last summer, according to a new federal study based in part on months of air quality testing in Willowbrook and nearby west suburban communities.

Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday that toxic pollution from the company’s Willowbrook sterilization plant was responsible for long-term cancer risks up to 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

Cancer risks remained high in the area despite improvements Sterigenics voluntarily undertook to prevent all but one-tenth of 1% of the ethylene oxide it used from escaping into surrounding neighborhoods.

“Based on current science, there are very high levels of risk,” said William Wehrum, the Trump administration’s top air official, who told sometimes angry residents at a public meeting in Burr Ridge that he takes their concerns “very, very seriously.”

Responding to questions, EPA officials said pollution from Sterigenics increased the risk of developing cancer for people living as far as 25 miles away from Willowbrook. The biggest risks were in six suburbs — Willowbrook, Darien, Burr Ridge, Hinsdale, Indian Head Park and Western Springs — and declined steadily the farther away a neighborhood was from the facility, according to a map the EPA posted online and statements from agency officials during the meeting.

Wehrum and other EPA officials suggested the company could take more aggressive steps that would allow its now-shuttered facility to safely resume operations. But bipartisan state legislation sent Thursday to Gov. J.B. Pritzker would ban Sterigenics from reopening unless medical equipment suppliers — the company’s main clients — certify their products can only be sterilized with ethylene oxide.

The new EPA report comes as the federal agency is pledging to adopt more stringent restrictions on sterilization facilities nationwide, a rare departure from attempts by Wehrum and other Trump appointees to block, delay or undermine environment and public health regulations.

Willowbrook is a focal point in the ongoing debate, largely because EPA scientists determined last year that neighborhoods near Sterigenics are among just a few dozen throughout the U.S. where breathing toxic chemicals is responsible for more than 1 case of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetime.

Like in the Willowbrook area, ethylene oxide is the main chemical of concern in nearly all of those other areas. The volatile gas has been on the federal list of carcinogens since 1985, and in 2016 the EPA released a long-delayed reassessment linking it more conclusively to breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas at extremely low levels of exposure.

Several residents at the Wednesday meeting said they don’t trust the EPA or Sterigenics to protect them. Agency officials, they noted, acknowledged that local cancer risks likely were significantly higher in the past when the Willowbrook facility emitted up to 169,000 pounds of ethylene oxide a year.

“The only appropriate resolution … is for Sterigenics to permanently shut down,” said Margie Donnell, a member of the Stop Sterigenics community group.

More than 19,000 people live within a mile of the Willowbrook facility. Four schools and a day care center also are close by, including Hinsdale South High School in Darien and Gower Middle School in Burr Ridge.

Laws and regulations don’t allow the EPA to force Sterigenics to close for good, Wehrum said, but the agency can take action to ensure cancer risks posed by the company’s pollution are within federal guidelines.

Wednesday’s meeting was the third public forum organized by federal and state officials since the EPA released its latest National Air Toxics Assessment in late August.

A Chicago Tribune analysis of agency data revealed that of 73,057 census tracts in the United States, seven tracts near Sterigenics are among just 109 nationwide with long-term cancer risks exceeding the agency’s guidelines. The findings prompted months of intense pressure from elected officials and the public, forcing the EPA to pay closer attention to a once-obscure industry.

“It is not lost upon us, and it certainly isn’t lost upon me, the depth to which this has affected you,” John Kim, acting director of the Illinois EPA, told residents. “We are doing everything we can to bring you relief.”

After months of meetings with Wehrum and his staff, Sterigenics is vowing to overhaul its facility again, even as the company contends that other sources of ethylene oxide were responsible for spikes of the toxic gas recorded by monitoring equipment deployed near its facility between November and March."
Macomb Township petition granted by Department of Justice,https://www.clickondetroit.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/macomb-township-petition-granted-by-department-of-justice,"DETROIT - Macomb Township General Counsel, Thomas D. Esordi, has been notified by the United States Department of Justice that Macomb Township’s petition for remission of $66,000 has been granted.

Macomb Township will receive this money after the submission of administrative paperwork which is being prepared.

After an investigation by the FBI, the Department of Justice determined that Macomb Township was the victim of “extortion and bribery” related to a business transaction.

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

President Donald Trump Announces 5% Tariff On All Goods From Mexico,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-31/president-donald-trump-announces-5-tariff-on-all-goods-from-mexico,"President Donald Trump said he would carry out his plan under the authority granted to him by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

President Donald Trump announced that the United States will impose a 5% tariff next month on all goods coming from Mexico.

The president tweeted Thursday that the tariff will begin June 10 and remain in place until ""illegal immigrants coming through Mexico and into our country stop,"" and the tariff will gradually increase ""until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.""

Trump said he would carry out his plan under the authority granted to him by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

A statement from the White House said the tariff is a response to the ""emergency"" at the U.S.-Mexico border. If the issue is not alleviated through ""effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment,"" the tariff on all goods will increase to 10% July 1 and continue to increase by 5% each month until it reaches 25% on Oct. 1.

At that time, the tariff will permanently remain at 25%.

The statement claims that the high tariff will cause companies in Mexico to move back to the U.S. to make their products. Companies that return to America will not be subject to the tariff.

""Should Mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration, the sustained imposition of tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to American cities and towns,"" the statement said. ""Remember, our great country has been the 'piggy bank' from which everybody wants only to take. The difference is that now we are firmly and forcefully standing up for America's interests.""

Following Trump's announcement, U.S. stock futures and global stock markets , including shares of Asian and European automakers, fell Friday. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.63%, Britain's FTSE 100 dipped 1% and Germany's DAX slipped 1.78%.

""We have confidence that Mexico can and will act swiftly to help the United States stop this long-term, dangerous and deeply unfair problem,"" the statement said. ""The United States has been very good to Mexico for many years. We are now asking that Mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country.""

President Trump has accused FBI agent Peter Strzok, who served on Mueller's team, of treason.

"US inflation up in April, says Commerce Department",https://www.foxbusiness.com,[],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-inflation-up-in-april-says-commerce-department,"U.S. inflation picked up in April after a very weak start to the year, a development that could help to ease Federal Reserve officials’ recent concerns about tepid price pressures.

Continue Reading Below

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.31% in April from March and 1.51% from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Excluding volatile food and energy items, the so-called core PCE price index was up 0.25% from March—the fastest monthly pace since October 2016—and 1.57% from April 2018. Economist surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected core PCE prices to rise 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year.

The Commerce Department also revised down its inflation numbers for the first three months of the year. The PCE price index in March was up 1.44% from the year-ago month, down from a previous estimate of 1.49%.

Inflation remains well below the Fed’s 2% target, a level central bankers view as consistent with a solid economy. They worry a slower rate could be a sign of weak domestic demand.

At a time of low unemployment and solid economic growth, Fed officials also fear that tepid price pressures could cause consumers and businesses to expect low inflation in the future, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy that would make it harder to hit their target. Worse still, low inflation could give way to deflation—an economically dangerous fall in prices—during a recession.

Though the central bank is unlikely to give too much weight to one month of data, Friday’s numbers could help to reinforce Fed officials’ view that weak inflation at the beginning of 2019 would prove temporary. Prices for services, which account for the bulk of U.S. consumer spending and had posted an unusual decline in January, rose 0.37% in April, their biggest monthly jump since October 2014."

DOJ demands to see CoreLogic's MLS data in antitrust probe,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Jessica Guerin Is An Editor At Housingwire Covering Reverse Mortgages', 'The Housing Wealth Space. She Is A Graduate Of Boston University', 'Has A Master S Degree Northwestern S Medill School Of Journalism. She Worked Previously As The Editor-In-Chief Of The Reverse Review Magazine', 'Which Was Recently Acquired Housingwire.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49198-doj-demands-to-see-corelogics-mls-data-in-antitrust-probe,"The Department of Justice recently sent a letter to CoreLogic requesting access to its MLS data regarding buyer broker compensation, a clear sign that the federal authorities are actively investigating allegations of antitrust violations among multiple listing service providers.

The DOJ’s letter follows two class-action lawsuits recently filed against the National Association of Realtors and brokerages, including Realogy, HomeServices of America, RE/MAX and Keller Williams, that center around the practice of requiring that a buyer’s broker be compensated in a home-sale transaction.

Both suits allege that NAR and the MLS providers conspired to drive up seller costs and reduce competition by requiring a home seller to pay compensation to the buyer’s broker, even though their involvement in the transaction is minimal.

For its part, NAR has said that it has no role in determining the buyer broker’s fee and has promised to fight the allegations, calling them “baseless” and full of “an abundance of false claims.”

But it appears the DOJ isn’t so convinced.

In a letter to CoreLogic, which was posted on the website Notorious R.O.B, the DOJ specifically requests “all documents relating to any MLS member’s search of [listings] based on compensation offered by listing brokers to buyer brokers, or the type of compensation, such as a flat fee, offered to listing brokers by buyer brokers.”

It also requests any documents relating to a possible antitrust issue regarding the ability to search based on the type of compensation offered.

Meanwhile, a form filed by CoreLogic with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday stated that the company’s chief legal officer, Arnold Pinkston, will be leaving in mid-June to pursue an opportunity elsewhere.

Although Pinkston will be leaving the company in the midst of the DOJ investigation, the filing explicitly states that his decision was not based on a disagreement with the company.

CoreLogic spokesperson Alyson Austin confirmed to HousingWire that the company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the DOJ “relating to an investigation of practices of residential real estate brokerage services in local markets in the United States.” Austin said the company intends to comply with the request and is not the focus of the investigation."
DOJ watchdog says assistant US attorney admitted to eating marijuana edibles,https://thehill.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/446196-doj-watchdog-says-assistant-us-attorney-admitted-to-eating-marijuana,"A Department of Justice watchdog has alleged that an assistant U.S. attorney ate marijuana edibles and did not properly disclose the use of a controlled substance on a security form, according to a new report.

The report, released Thursday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), said the unnamed assistant U.S. attorney self-reported to the OIG that they possessed, transported and consumed the edibles in August or September 2016 for back pain.

The attorney's spouse allegedly threatened to report the use to the Justice Department during a marital dispute because they assumed the attorney had not disclosed it on their Questionnaire for National Security Positions form, according to the OIG report.

The report stated that the attorney noted that when they submitted this form in February 2017, it erroneously said they had not used a controlled substance in the past seven years.

The Justice Department watchdog concluded the attorney violated federal and state criminal law and “lacked candor” in an interview with the OIG, during which they said their incorrect responses on the form were inadvertent. Federal and state authorities opted against any criminal prosecution.

The OIG noted that it has provided its report to the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility and to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys “for action they deem appropriate.”

“As Director I take any allegation of AUSA misconduct very seriously,"" James A. Crowell IV, director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, said in a statement to The Hill. ""Due to the Privacy Act I cannot comment further on personnel matters.”

EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."
Trump administration urges Supreme Court to fast-track decision on DACA,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-on-daca-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-fast-track-decision-on-immigration-program/,"The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to quickly determine if it will hear oral arguments in a prolonged legal battle over President Trump's decision to terminate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation.

In a brief filed with little fanfare late last week, the Justice Department asked the conservative-leaning court to announce whether it intends to hold arguments before the end of June on several petitions concerning the administration's 2017 decision to wind down the program.

U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who represents the federal government before the high court, said it's ""critical"" for the justices to make a decision before they enter their summer recess. This would allow the government and plaintiffs to prepare briefs for oral arguments before the court's fall term, Francisco said in his brief.

The solicitor general raised several concerns about the prolonged litigation surrounding the program, which has been kept alive after several lower courts ruled against the administration. Francisco urged the court to ""expedite"" his request and consolidate the handful of cases for consideration next term.

In one passage, Francisco suggested that efforts by Congress to address the situation of those covered under DACA were being stymied by the ongoing court cases. ""The very existence of this pending litigation (and lingering uncertainty) continues to impede efforts to enact legislation addressing the legitimate policy concerns underlying the DACA policy,"" he wrote.

Several efforts to place young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, on a pathway to citizenship have failed for nearly two decades. Although Mr. Trump has expressed some sympathy for this group of immigrants, he has repeatedly opposed stand-alone bills to legalize DACA recipients, and his administration did not include a permanent fix for the program in its latest immigration plan, spearheaded by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.

In the coming weeks, House Democrats are set hold a floor vote on their latest version of the DREAM Act, which would put millions of young undocumented immigrants — as well as immigrants with temporary protections — on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court is expected to consider the Justice Department's latest petition Thursday during a closed-door session.

Since then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in 2017 that the government would move to gradually dismantle the program, four federal circuit courts have issued injunctions — one as recently as last week — blocking the administration from ending the program. Since late last year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court, which now includes two justices appointed by the president, to take up the case.

The government currently allows DACA recipients to renew their protections — valid for two years — but it is not accepting new applications."
"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Chris Roberts']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"Advocates, industry representatives, regulators, health professionals and marijuana legalization opponents stood up before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday to share their perspectives on how to best approach regulating the cannabis compound CBD.

There are lots of questions, including many related to safety we will need to answer to ensure that FDA is taking an appropriate, well-informed, and science-based approach to the regulation of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, including CBD. — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

The first-of-its-kind public meeting is meant to inform the FDA’s approach as it considers developing alternative pathways to regulate cannabidiol, which is not currently permitted in the food supply or as a dietary supplement.

Here’s a look at the discussions that took place at the event:

Advocates and opponents

Jonathan Miller, general counsel at U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said there is “an urgent need for an efficient regulatory framework for CBD” and noted that it was the intent of Congress to provide for the marketing of hemp-derived CBD products when it passed the 2018 Farm Bill, federally legalizing the crop and its derivatives.

Interestingly, Miller said his organization has been working with lawmakers in recent weeks to draft standalone legislation to regulate CBD if the FDA determines that the task is too complicated for the agency to complete on its own. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who led the charge on hemp legalization, previously suggested that further legislative action may be necessary to unlock the full potential of the hemp economy.

The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), which represents a wide range of industry stakeholders, made a similar argument in its testimony.

Andrew Kline, the group’s director of public policy, said “we strongly recommend [that] FDA act quickly to clarify the regulatory environment.”

“Because there are significant confusions in the market, businesses don’t know what is legally permissible and some are making health claims in the absence of clear regulatory guidance,” he said. “Most significantly, banks and payment processors don’t understand [the regulatory rules] and as a result many CBD companies are at risk of losing financial services.”

NCIA also provided the panel with extensive written testimony it compiled from more than 100 industry representatives, scientists and attorneys in support of establishing clear regulatory guidelines for CBD.

“The bottom line is this: an overwhelming preponderance of evidence indicates that cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds present minimal safety concerns,” Kline said. He added that the FDA should create universal testing and labeling requirements to “help protect the public from health and safety risks.”

On the opposing side, members of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) Canada and the Marijuana Victims Alliance offered testimony that touched on CBD regulations but mostly served to express opposition to marijuana reform more broadly.

“The public is up against a narrative that is at war with science,” SAM Canada’s Pamela McColl said. She claimed that marijuana is addictive, leads people to harm themselves and damages DNA.

“The subversion of truth and science and what is going on in North America [is a source of] great concern and reason to pause and do risk assessments on these drugs and analyze the influence of the billionaires and in the industry that have influenced public sentiment and dictated a very deceitful campaign,” she said.

Sally Schindel, the representative from Marijuana Victims Alliance, said that her son committed suicide, which she attributed in large part to his cannabis use.

“What we need is our federal government enforcing federal laws,” she said. “We need FDA to be more involved and take a leading role in marijuana research and policy formation.”

Shawn Hauser, a hemp and cannabinoid attorney with the law firm Vicente Sederberg LLP, represented the Cannabis Trade Federation at the hearing. “The appropriate regulation of products containing lawful cannabinoids already exists, and that data arising out of the state-regulated regime supports such regulation,” she said.

But “whether right or wrong, the current situation has created a vacuum. It opens the door to bad actors,” which ought to inform the FDA’s next steps.

“Cannabis products can be safely regulated under the existing dietary supplement framework and where products are intended for non-medicinal purposes, it is appropriate to regulate them as such,” she said. “The years of data from these state regulatory regimes are an important source of data for the agency to consider in determining the regulatory pathway. We stand ready to advance to the next level as a partner with FDA in effective federal regulation of cannabinoid products.”

Regulators

Represents from state regulatory agencies in Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania also addressed the uncertainty that’s prevalent throughout the industry without updated FDA guidelines.

“Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,” Pam Miles of the Virginia Department of Agriculture, said. She added that her department “is hopeful that FDA will begin to supply significant leadership as it related to CBD, including research related to its health impacts.”

Brenda Morris, representing the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, talked about the “patchwork of laws” surrounding CBD and how that has fostered an environment where “anything is allowed.”

“Without the FDA’s guidance and leadership, individual states may carve out their own regulatory exceptions for CBD,” Joseph Reardon of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said, noting that his state’s hemp industry has greatly expanded in recent years. “We urge the FDA to resolve the statutory issues and properly establish a legal pathway for CBD products to enter the market place.”

Also, thanks to the public for your comments & participation. You can submit comments through 7/2. https://t.co/z5ghSj1yBW pic.twitter.com/Ai8w3zuHy7 — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

Health and consumer advocates

The Alzheimer’s Association argued that existing research is insufficient to substantiate claims about the therapeutic potential of cannabis for Alzheimer’s and dementia. The group said the “lack of evidence creates a substantial risk for individuals and their families.”

The American Epilepsy Society expressed similar concerns, despite CBD being an FDA-approved drug in the treatment of seizures in the form of Epidiolex.

“We support reducing regulatory barriers to research of cannabis-derived compounds,” a representative for the group said. “We strongly urge the FDA to classify the compounds and drugs under the complete jurisdiction of the FDA. We also advocate for ongoing studies on the efficacy of cannabis drugs.”

Ashley Morgan of the American Veterinary Medical Association told the FDA panel that “we believe there is therapeutic potential in the development of cannabis-derived and cannabis-related compounds and we would like to see the potential realized.”

“We believe FDA must seriously consider the need for efficacy and safety data when therapeutic claims are made” about CBD products, she said. “To facilitate the development of such products for veterinary use is imperative [for the FDA to] provide pathways to ensure the regulatory clarity and predictability and economic viability of the industry. The agency must make enforcement priorities known and consistently and intentionally act on the priorities.”

Another interesting testimony came from Larry Walker at the University of Mississippi, which is currently the site of the nation’s only federally authorized marijuana manufacturer for research purposes. He raised some concerns about potential adverse effects of CBD but made a series of recommendations to the FDA about how to minimize risks.

“A possible path forward, it seems to us, is prudent to have a multitrack approach with these products that are cannabis-related,” Walker said.

“It would be outstanding if the FDA could conduct some basic studies in this realm. It is a national need,” he said. “We need a national testing program for cannabinoid quality and standardization, a national adverse reporting program for whatever products are out there and a rapid response program for products where there are serious incidents. We need analytical backup on many of these things where the serious incidents have occurred. Finally, if possible, together research outcomes in the state medical programs.”

Sue Sisley, an internal medicine physician at the Scottsdale Research Institute, expressed frustration over the fact that the DEA “has not processed” applications to increase the number of authorized manufacturers for research-grade cannabis “despite members of Congress repeatedly urging” the agency to do so.

“Sadly, because of the limitations with the current drug supply, we are forced to import study drugs from a Canadian manufacturer and that is disappointing to us,” she said. “We would like to see our own domestic variety of domestic manufacturers. The point is that researchers need access to options. Scientists need options when it is to embolden scientific freedom.”

James Beck, representing the Parkinson’s Foundation, noted that while traditional pharmaceuticals can treat some of the symptoms Parkinson’s patients experience, many remain unaddressed, leaving the community “seeking alternative ways in which to control the symptoms.”

He said that marijuana doesn’t seem to treat tremors, but “it may be helpful on a targeted level for nonmotor symptoms, sleep, anxiety.”

“Bottom line, we really need more research to understand the utility of cannabis for Parkinson’s disease,” Beck said. “I don’t know that there’s very other circumstances we have a drug that is life-saving.”

Jacqueline French of the Epilepsy Foundation said that the group wants the FDA to “preserve access to CBD for those who need it as a life-saving medication.” However, she emphasized the need to create “manufacturing standards” to avoid contamination from mold and other contaminants.

Americans for Safe Access’s Heather Despres talked about standards that her organization has developed, recommending that the FDA consider integrating some of their best practices on “cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations.”

“There are many challenges facing the cannabis industry. There are solutions available,” she said. “We have worked with state regulators to develop and implement a standard, [and] we look forward to working with you, together, to help implement those standards.”

FDA reaction

Amy Abernethy, the FDA principal deputy commissioner who helped organize the public meeting, identified several themes that emerged during the talks.

In general, there is a need to “further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market,” to provide that clarification in timely manner, to collect data on CBD to ensure that the products are safe and to create labeling standards so consumers know what they’re getting.

Here is some of what I am hearing… First, there is a need to further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market. The product questions apply to people and animals. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Key questions about product safety need to be addressed. Data are needed to determine safety thresholds for CBD; datasets/information should be objective, of adequate quality and available for transparent review. Lab testing and data analyses need to be replicable. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Consumers need consistent information and labeling. State/government entities need support in knowing what to do. And we really need to understand the implications for children when they take CBD-containing products at different dosage ranges. More updates later today. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Another theme that seemed to develop is the lack of information about dosing guidelines. Several experts who testified were unable to give clear answers to the FDA panel when asked about what the proper doses are in different contexts, and what their affects on consumers are.

Many people use these products. For CBD, info presented suggests that many consumers think that regulatory pathways are fully in place to keep products safe. Meanwhile speakers reinforced that regulatory pathways are unclear. We must sort this out in service of public health. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Today’s meeting illuminated many different issues encountered by manufacturers, researchers, local governments, etc (e.g., labeling, marketing, access to research product, terminology, manufacturing, standards). — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Systematic studies are needed. It sounds like a number of studies are available or underway. We also wonder if real-world evidence derived from electronic health records, personal monitors, administrative data, etc, can be used to address critical questions in this space. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

I suspect that the public docket will expand our understanding, add new information, and reinforce observations today. We will work as quickly as possible to define a way forward.

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” Wyden said.

“Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Senators occasionally place holds on nominees who they find highly problematic, or to extract concessions. A hold prevents the Senate from quickly confirming the nominee.

Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel overseeing Treasury, is seeking information from the department on Mnuchin's decision to decline a House Democratic request for Trump’s tax returns.

After a series of delays, Mnuchin told Neal in a May 6 letter that he would not comply with the request after consulting with the Department of Justice.

Neal then sent subpoenas for the returns to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, which are likely to spawn a lengthy court battle.

In a May 14 letter, Wyden asked Mnuchin for copies of emails, memorandums and other communications detailing how Mnuchin came to his decision.

Wyden also asked Mnuchin for information on how the IRS handled previous congressional requests for tax returns, under section 6103(f) of the tax code, the same provision Neal cited in his request for Trump’s returns. That section states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" tax returns requested by the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means committees.

In a Wednesday letter to Wyden, the Treasury Department only handed over copies of Mnuchin’s previous correspondence to Neal and a report on requests for returns under 6103 in 2018.

Wyden called the reply “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”"
