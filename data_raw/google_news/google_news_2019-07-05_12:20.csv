Trump calls bluff of critics in July 4th speech,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/politics/trump-july-4th-speech/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump was as good as his word Thursday: He saluted America.

In one of the least polarizing speeches of his presidency, Trump paid tribute to America's armed forces at a July Fourth appearance before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington that unfolded amid stormy skies and criticism that he was politicizing the nation's Independence Day celebrations.

""We will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us,"" Trump said. ""The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free. We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.""

Trump's speech, delivered close to the spot where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I have a dream speech,"" lacked the dark imagery of many of his campaign speeches and struck a more optimistic tone than he typically adopts.

As warplanes roared overhead and the jumbo jet used as Air Force One performed a rare flyover over the National Mall, Trump spoke as critics accused him of exploiting the nation's birthday party for his own political ends in an event he had dubbed ""A Salute to America."" Trump's speech lacked the partisan rhetoric of his rallies. But the event nevertheless bolstered the President's narrative that he is a strong commander in chief and a decisive leader.

"With Flyovers and Flags, Trump Plays M.C. for the Fourth",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/us/politics/trump-4th-july.html,"WASHINGTON — In a made-for-television Independence Day production starring America’s military weaponry, President Trump on Thursday used the Lincoln Memorial as the backdrop for a tribute to the country’s armed forces and a call for unity that has been largely absent during his divisive presidency.

Flanked by Bradley armored vehicles and M1A2 tanks in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Trump paid homage to the five branches of the military as a chorus sang each service hymn and he cued the arrival of fighter jets, helicopters and other military aircraft as they roared overhead.

Speaking to a rain-soaked audience filled with troops decked out in “Make America Great Again” and “Trump 2020” paraphernalia, the president finally presided over the grand military display that he has wanted since witnessing the Bastille Day parade in Paris two years ago.

In a 45-minute speech delivered behind rain-streaked bulletproof glass, the president singled out a long list of Americans for their contributions to science, medicine, politics and the arts, and spun a history that praised everything from the civil rights movement to space exploration and praised everyone from the suffragists to Harriet Tubman to Chuck Yeager. But he spent most of his time recounting the progression of the armed forces, ending his remarks as the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” blared through huge speakers and the Blue Angels soared overhead."
"Trump urged to ignore Supreme Court, print census question: 'Because we should,' GOP lawmaker says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-congressman-trump-ignore-supreme-court-print-census-citizenship-question,"A Republican congressman has encouraged President Trump to ignore the Supreme Court and print the 2020 U.S. Census with the question about citizenship, as the president mulls an executive order.

Rep. Chip Roy, who represents the Lone Star State's 21st Congressional District -- covering much of the area north of San Antonio, plus much of Austin -- made the call on social media amid the controversy over the census citizenship question that caused some confusion within the Trump administration on whether the question will appear on the survey.

“It’s the lawyers advising him,” Roy wrote in a tweet. “[Trump] should ignore them. Completely. Print the Census with the questions — and issue a statement explaining why — ‘because we should.’ Done.”

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON CITIZENSHIP QUESTION FOR 2020 CENSUS, REPORTEDLY MULLS EXECUTIVE ORDER

The Supreme Court last week blocked the citizenship question for the time being until more reasoning from the administration can be provided.

This prompted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to initially announce that his department would print the census without the citizenship question amid the Supreme Court objections.

“The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question,” Ross said in a statement. “My focus and that of the bureau and the entire department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

The Texas congressman, a freshman Republican, fired back on social media after being accused of openly calling on Trump to ignore the high court.

“Lawless is the state of our border. Lawless is being ruled by Judges on matters of policy choices,” he tweeted. “Lawless is NOT rightly advising the President to follow the Constitution and include a citizenship question on the census — particularly in light of the opinion.”

Trump has been critical of the Supreme Court block, attacking it as “totally ridiculous” that the U.S. government “cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship.”

DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP BOTCHES CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WITH TOO MUCH LAWYERING AND TOO LITTLE EXPLANATION

On Wednesday, Trump said that reports that that Commerce had dropped the “quest” to put the question on the census were “fake!”

“We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question,” he tweeted.

On Thursday Trump said his administration is still working to add the question on the census, with reports saying he’s mulling an executive order to do so, a move that would lead to a showdown between his administration and the Supreme Court.

“So important for our Country that the very simple and basic ‘Are you a Citizen of the United States?’ question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census,” he tweeted.

Multiple outlets reported that Trump is considering using an executive order to move forward with the push. The Washington Post reported that Trump had told lawyers to fix the situation with an executive order and add it to the census later.

Both of Trump's most recent previous would-be nominees, conservative analyst Stephen Moore and businessman Herman Cain , endorsed returning to the gold standard. But Shelton is far more identified with her advocacy for the idea, which is based on the belief that the price of gold is stable and would make the dollar less susceptible to inflation or other volatility.

""It sounds kind of persuasive if you haven't studied economics, but it's really completely counter-factual and for good reason,"" said Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford University.

The Justice Department in Washington in May 2013. (J. David Ake/AP)

Contributing columnist

Pity the poor Justice Department lawyer who draws the short straw these days.

On Wednesday, only 24 hours after assuring a federal district judge that the government would not try to add to the 2020 Census the citizenship question the Supreme Court had blocked, the department suddenly reversed ground.

That left it to a sheepish and bewildered career Justice Department lawyer, Joshua Gardner, to tell Judge George M. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland that he was backing away from firm representations he had made to the court on behalf of the federal government just a day earlier.

The sole provocation for this humiliating situation: a tweet from President Trump on Wednesday morning asserting “we are absolutely moving forward” on the citizenship question,” notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision.

You read that right: a tweet. Nothing more.

Gardner had no choice but to inform the court, “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue. . . . As you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.""

And, in short order, Gardner found himself backpedaling and doing his best to defend his own credibility, pleading to the court that, “I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years through multiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Translation: I’m a career employee and not a Trump toady; I recognize that the department looks lawless and untrustworthy right now, but please try not to hold it too much against us going forward.

Career Justice Department lawyers are used to working in anonymity and with the winds of their credibility and that of the department as a whole at their backs. This is very far from the way Gardner would like to have seen his name in the national news.

Likewise for Sarah Fabian, the career lawyer forced to the front lines to draw the fire of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — and public humiliation — for defending the proposition that denying immigrants soap and toothbrushes complies with the statutory mandate of “sanitary” detention facilities.

The fault here — beyond the obvious erratic lurching of the president and his l’etat-c’est-moi disregard of the rule of law — rests with Justice Department leadership.

Administrations change positions. That is understood and legitimate. But they do it with care, circumspection and due regard for the need to respect the law as objective and continuous, and for their duty of candor to the courts.

So the true eyebrow-raising feature of the department’s abrupt U-turn on the census is its absence of deliberation. The assistant attorney general for the civil division, Jody Hunt, who joined the conference before the court, conceded that the tweet was the sole impetus for the reversal.

That demonstrates an undue, if not ridiculous, solicitude for the whims of the mad king. The indication that Trump wanted to find a way around the ruling of the Supreme Court should have been (at most) a trigger for a reasoned process involving department leadership — in particular, the solicitor general, the client (in this case, the Commerce Department) and, perhaps, the White House counsel.

And voices within those discussions needed to be ready push back against political caprice, or measure it against the government’s longer-term responsibility to safeguard its credibility with the court and display fidelity to the rule of law. That is ultimately a service to the president, as well as to the department and the courts.

Yes, time is very short, but there is no indication of any such process having taken place here. Trump tweets; the department disposes.

The backwards somersault was all the more ill-considered given the severe credibility problems that the department and administration have created in this very case. The Supreme Court’s decision took the very unusual step of essentially rejecting as pretextual the proffered reason for including the citizenship question. Even before that, Hazel had taken the unusual step of reopening the case based on new evidence suggesting that the true reason for the question was to increase the political power of Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Finally, the solicitor general had made repeated representations to the Supreme Court that June 30 was a drop-dead date after which the census question could not be added. Now that the administration seems to believe otherwise, it leaves him with egg on his face.

The department seems relatively indifferent to the institutional cost of defending the imperial presidency, including the potential erosion in public confidence that the government is constrained by law. But this latest episode is a new indication that the federal courts at least are taking notice. The 9th Circuit on Wednesday handed the administration its latest setback, rejecting its request to stay a District Court ruling blocking the diversion of military funds to pay for Trump’s border wall.

If the department continues to jump at the president’s every hiccup — candor and consistency be damned — it may find that the courts are more likely to deny it the traditional benefit of the doubt and reject its litigating positions. That is more than an embarrassment for the front-line lawyers; it is a body blow to the department’s institutional interests and, potentially, the public’s confidence in a government of laws, not of men.

It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

JUST WATCHED Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP 03:55

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
"Trump doubles down on citizenship question for 2020 census, reportedly mulls executive order",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-citizenship-2020-census,"President Trump on Thursday doubled down on his push for a citizenship question on the 2020 census, promising that his administration is ""working very hard"" on the controversial issue -- as reports say he is mulling using an executive order to get the question on the census.

“So important for our Country that the very simple and basic ‘Are you a Citizen of the United States?’ question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census,” he tweeted.

TRUMP DECLARES PUSH FOR CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOT OVER, CALLS REPORTS 'FAKE'

He added that the Commerce and Justice Departments are “working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July!”

Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced that his department was going ahead with the printing of the census without the citizenship question, apparently indicating that the administration had dropped the controversial issue. That decision came after a Supreme Court ruling last week that blocked the citizenship question for the time being until more reasoning from the administration was provided.

“The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question,” Ross said in a statement. “My focus and that of the bureau and the entire department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

The Commerce Department had claimed that the question would help the administration enforce the Voting Rights Act. Opponents of the question fear that by asking people about their citizenship status, immigrants may not want to respond and be counted in the census. This would result in official population numbers that are lower than they truly are, which in turn could yield less federal funding and fewer congressional seats in districts with high immigrant populations. Those districts tend to favor Democrats.

Ross’ announcement appeared to mark a significant climbdown for the administration. But Trump on Wednesday said that reports that Commerce had dropped the “quest” to put the question on the census were “fake!”

“We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question,” he tweeted.

IN REVERSAL, DOJ SAYS IT IS STILL TRYING TO ADD CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO CENSUS; JUDGE SETS FRIDAY DEADLINE

Later Wednesday, a high-ranking Justice Department lawyer told a federal judge that the administration had not abandoned efforts to put the question on the census, saying that there may yet be a “legally available path” open to the administration.

On Thursday, multiple outlets reported that Trump is considering using an executive order to move forward with the push. The Washington Post reported that Trump had told lawyers to fix the situation with an executive order and add it to the census later.

""The administration is considering the appropriateness of an executive order that would address the constitutional need for the citizenship question to be included in the 2020 census,"" a source told Axios.

Such a move would likely face significant legal pushback, and could also fail in the Supreme Court. But one official told Axios that it may allow the administration to shift the blame for the ultimate failure of the push on Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.

""I think that there’s a good argument to be made that even though the president may lose in litigation at the end of the day, going through that process ultimately makes it clear that it’s the chief justice, and not the Executive Branch, that bears responsibility for that unfortunate outcome,"" the source with knowledge of discussions told the outlet.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that under a new plan, immigrants would instead watch videotaped instructions that explain to defendants the scope of their rights and how their proceedings will be carried out in immigration courts.

Department of Justice (DOJ) officials reportedly informed the nation's immigration judges of the change last month. The videos are prerecorded in Spanish and a number of indigenous languages, the Chronicle reports, as many of those coming north from Central America are not native Spanish speakers.

An official with the agency told the Chronicle that the plan was “part of an effort to be good stewards of [DOJ's] limited resources.”

However, the head of a union representing immigration judges, who are DOJ employees, told the Chronicle that the plan would remove an ""integral"" part of the immigration court system.

“Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost — it’s an integral part of every case,” Ashley Tabaddor said, according to the newspaper.

""If they actually look at the courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters, and reflects the flaw of having the courts run by a law enforcement agency,"" she added.

""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate?"" asked one judge, who remained anonymous in order to discuss the plan with the Chronicle.

""You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?"" the judge reportedly added, calling the decision ""a disaster in the making."""
"Obama DHS chief blasts Dems’ ‘open borders’ push, warns migration would explode",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-dhs-chief-blasts-dems-open-borders-push-warns-migration-would-explode,"An Obama-era Department of Homeland Security chief is warning Democratic presidential candidates to cool their push to decriminalize illegal border crossings, saying such a move would be tantamount to “open borders” policy and lead to hundreds of thousands more people flooding into the U.S. every month.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities,https://www.npr.org,"['Joel Rose', 'John Burnett']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738179391/dhs-inspector-general-finds-dangerous-overcrowding-in-border-patrol-facilities,"DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities

Enlarge this image toggle caption Office of Inspector General Office of Inspector General

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General is warning about ""dangerous overcrowding"" in Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.

In a strongly worded report, the inspector general said the prolonged detention of migrants without proper food, hygiene or laundry facilities — some for more than a month — requires ""immediate attention and action.""

The report comes amid growing outrage over detention conditions for migrants and follows reports that migrant children were kept in squalid conditions without enough food and basic necessities in a Border Patrol station in West Texas.

Inspectors from DHS's Office of Inspector General in June visited Border Patrol facilities and ports of entry across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest sector in the country for illegal border crossings.

""We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,"" they wrote.

In its response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security says the surge of migrants crossing the Southern border has led to an ""acute and worsening crisis.""

""The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond,"" DHS says.

In May, according to DHS, an average of more than 4,600 people a day crossed illegally or arrived at ports of entry without the proper documents, compared to less than 700 a day in the same period two years ago.

DHS says Customs and Border Protection facilities are at ""peak capacity"" and that the agency is adding detention capacity at three tent facilities in order to improve the conditions for migrants. CBP also says it ""continues to take steps to address the health and safety of those in custody,"" including by expanding medical services.

The inspector general's office released a report in May describing similarly dangerous overcrowding conditions in Border Patrol cells in the El Paso region.

The latest report from the Rio Grande Valley includes photos of migrants penned into overcrowded Border Patrol facilities — including one man pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word ""Help.""

The inspectors quote one unnamed senior manager calling the situation a ""ticking time bomb.""

Inspectors found that hundreds of children were held for longer than the 72 hours, the maximum time federal rules allow. In some cases, kids were held for more than two weeks. And some adults were kept in standing-room-only cells, without access to showers, for more than a week.

Inspectors said Border Patrol management informed them there had been ""security incidents,"" such as detainees clogging toilets with Mylar blankets and socks in order to be released from their cells during maintenance.

""We ended our site visit at one Border Patrol facility early because our presence was agitating an already difficult situation,"" the inspectors wrote. ""Specifically, when detainees observed us, they banged on the cell windows, shouted, pressed notes to the window with their time in custody, and gestured to evidence of their time in custody (e.g., beards)."""
House Democrats file lawsuit to obtain Trump tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Lauren Fox', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Clare Foran', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/tax-return-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to enforce subpoenas and obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, an escalation in a fight for the President's personal financial information.

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

In truth, Mr. Trump is the best thing that has happened to the United States since Ronald Reagan was in office, and Reagan was the best president since Lincoln. Lincoln’s opponents used a pistol. The current president’s critics attempt to do him in with vindictiveness. Mr. Widmer sees Mr. Trump’s brash tone as divergent from Lincoln’s down-home pleasantries, while he failed to acknowledge the main objective of both men: to defeat those who would divide us, and to make the United States a great place for all its citizens, regardless of race, creed or color.

Mr. Widmer should note the policies of President Barack Obama had just the opposite effect. As would the current crop of Democratic candidates for president if this country is irrational enough to elect one of them in 2020.

Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

Trump at his rainy July 4 event: Americans ‘part of one of the greatest stories ever told’,https://wtkr.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://wtkr.com/2019/07/04/trump-promises-show-of-a-lifetime-with-july-4th-event-though-bad-weather-looms/,"Neither heavy rain nor a raft of criticism prevented President Donald Trump from delivering his “Salute to America” to a poncho-clad crowd on the National Mall on Thursday.

“Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America. It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true. It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future,” Trump said from behind rain streaked bullet-proof glass after a flyover from the plane that normally serves as Air Force One.

In his remarks, Trump told Americans “we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told.”

“Today, just as it did 243 years ago, the future of American Freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it,” Trump said.

It was a speech heavy on history and plaudits for the military, which helped plan and execute the spectacle that Trump organized.

Severe weather and low cloud cover hung over the Washington area for much of the afternoon beforehand, leading to questions of whether the event would be canceled or curtailed.

At one point, loudspeakers at Trump’s event at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington said the program that was supposed to start at 6:30 p.m. ET “has been delayed,” but the White House later said the event would mostly start on time.

Trump’s plans were a sharp change from how the holiday has been marked in the nation’s capital by previous presidents from either party.

“It will be the show of a lifetime!” Trump declared optimistically a day before.

The spectacle was likely to delight many Americans who view the military as one remaining unifying force for pride in a country divided along political, racial and economic lines. But it’s also drawn skepticism and criticism for its costs and political hue.

The Pentagon was wary of it, however, and the city of Washington openly opposed it. And even some White House officials wondered whether a speech meant to be apolitical would stay that way — and whether crowds would materialize to watch it.

Bands heralded the branches of the military with their official march songs. M1 Abrams tanks transported by heavy rail sat on display.

There were about 750 to 800 military personnel taking part in the celebration, a defense official told CNN. And that doesn’t include the 900 hundred members of the DC National Guard who were activated to provide traffic control and security on the streets and in the subway system.

Trump was hoping for an enormous crowd, and July Fourth reliably draws plenty of people to Washington. But the last time he delivered an address on the National Mall, on Inauguration Day, he was disappointed by the turnout, or at least in the way the turnout was depicted on the news.

That left some of his aides working overtime to fill out the space along the Mall where he spoke. It wasn’t clear ahead of the event that their efforts would be successful, and some people who were offered tickets this week — including donors and administration officials — said they’d already made other plans.

Trump addressed the masses in front of Abraham Lincoln’s 19-foot marble likeness, framed by the iconic Doric columns of the 16th president’s memorial. He faced a crowd of US military families, patriotic onlookers — and ticketed VIPs, including some of his Republican allies.

It’s all a vastly scaled-up version of how presidents ordinarily celebrate July Fourth, the date American colonists officially served notice to Britain in 1776. Usually the holiday is marked with a picnic for service members and their families on the White House South Lawn, followed by a viewing of fireworks over the Washington Monument.

Presidents haven’t traditionally delivered public remarks, much less an address on the National Mall. And the day hasn’t been marked by such overtly militaristic displays.

That caused concern even among US military brass that their ranks could end up politicized, according to people familiar with the matter. In the planning for the event, Pentagon leaders had reservations about putting tanks or other armored vehicles on display, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.

As the final details come together, several top military chiefs of the individual services are not attending and instead are sending alternates, though some said they had prior plans.

The White House insisted Trump’s speech would not be political and would instead honor the military and its service to the country. But Trump has a way of turning even official events into political moments, including at military installations, often to the delight of the rank-and-file troops he’s addressing.

And even his own top aide, Kellyanne Conway, told reporters this week that the speech would highlight “the success of this administration.”

The military displays Trump ordered up — which include the flyovers, tanks and other ceremonial units such as the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, the US Army Band (“Pershing’s Own”) and the US Marine Corps Silent Drill Team — have led some to compare the event to the authoritarian parades seen in places like China or North Korea.

But Trump’s inspiration was actually a parade in France, which he witnessed with delight on Bastille Day in 2017. He immediately began formulating plans to stage a parade of his own, though cost estimates later caused him to reduce his aspirations to the speech and military pageant that will be seen Thursday.

Through it all, Trump has taken enormous interest in even the smallest details, from the staging to the military equipment on display.

It’s those details that are likely to ratchet up the costs of the event, though the massive fireworks display that will cap the evening has been donated.

Already, the National Park Service is redirecting nearly $2.5 million to help cover costs related to the July 4 extravaganza, according to The Washington Post, money that the paper says is usually “primarily intended to improve parks across the country.”

It’s not clear how much the event will cost altogether, though Trump attempted to downplay the amount on Wednesday.

“The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth,” he wrote on Twitter. “We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!”

That isn’t entirely truthful — the planes used in the flyovers came from California, Missouri, Kentucky and Florida. And the costs of the event extend well beyond the military equipment.

For example, just the “transparent ballistic armor” used to protect the President during his speech could cost more than $24,000, according to government records.

This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday."
Buttigieg asks U.S. Justice Department for help after South Bend police shooting incident,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Congress', 'Campaigns', 'Health Policy', 'Pennsylvania Politics', 'Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/buttigieg-asks-us-justice-department-for-help-after-south-bend-police-shooting-incident/2019/07/03/7278e274-9cef-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg formally asked the U.S. Department of Justice to help him respond to the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in his city, but he stopped short of asking for a federal investigation.

In the weeks since South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill shot and killed Eric J. Logan, Buttigieg has faced criticism from an angry community that wants answers. Black activists have called on Buttigieg to ask the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to weigh in.

“The tragedy has touched off a painful discussion in our community about race, policing, and violence,” Buttigieg wrote in his letter. “Many South Bend residents, concerned about racial issues and their impact on our department, believe that the Department of Justice could be of assistance.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

[Buttigieg unveils national service plan with new climate and health programs]

It is not uncommon for local officials to request Justice Department civil rights investigations after incidents that strain relations between police and residents — as independent, federal inquiries often allay concerns of those who feel the police department or local prosecutor are not equipped to handle the cases themselves.

Sometimes, local officials request an investigation of a particular incident; other times, they seek a broader review of the patterns and practices of their police department. Such was the case, for example, in 2015 in Baltimore after riots erupted in the wake of a black man’s death in police custody.

Buttigieg’s request notably stops short of asking for any investigation, instead asking the department to tell him what resources it might be able to provide. Even if the mayor had asked for a broad review of his police department, it is unlikely the Justice Department would have obliged. While the Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration was aggressive about pushing police restructuring, President Trump’s former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was much less amenable to getting federal law enforcement involved in such cases. Attorney General William P. Barr has maintained Sessions’s view.

[‘We don’t trust you!’: After fatal police shooting, black residents confront Buttigieg]

Buttigieg acknowledged this Tuesday when reporters asked him about involving the Justice Department.

“The reality is the DOJ in this administration has shown considerably less interest in civil rights than it did in the last administration,” Buttigieg said. “Still, I want to open a discussion about different ways in which federal support could make a difference.”

Buttigieg has striven to show the South Bend black community and African American voters that he is listening to their concerns.

Speaking to an audience of black business leaders in Chicago on Tuesday, Buttigieg promised that if elected president he would prioritize tackling the nation’s persistent systematic racism. “We have pain now that reminds us that our community lives around a chasm,” Buttigieg said, referring to the police shooting. “Black residents and white residents experience every facet of life differently.”

Buttigieg told the crowd he accepted responsibility for not doing enough to diversify the police force and cultivate a community where black residents do not fear the police. But he said the problem is not just his town’s alone and that racial injustice does not just occur within law enforcement, but infiltrates every aspect of life from education to housing to health care.

“This is deeper than politics. This is not just a political problem. It is not just a police problem. It is not just my problem and my city’s problem. And it is certainly not just a black problem,” Buttigieg said. “This is an American problem, and it requires nationwide American solutions.”

He made his remarks at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition’s annual convention, an organization founded by civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Buttigieg met privately with Jackson ahead of his address, and the two men spoke to reporters after their chat. Asked to access Buttigieg’s handling of the police shooting in South Bend, Jackson commended the mayor.

“He’s handled an awful situation well by being transparent,” Jackson said."

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Members of Congress representing many of the D.C.-based federal workers whose jobs are about to be reassigned or moved to the Midwest are running out of ways to try to stop the Trump administration from relocating those offices.

Democratic lawmakers have written a flurry of letters, bills and amendments in a race to block the measures before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, with little success.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last month finalized plans to move about 550 jobs at two scientific agencies in the Agriculture Department from Southwest Washington to the greater Kansas City region.

In a separate move, the administration has threatened to furlough and possibly lay off 150 workers at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal workforce’s human resources agency, if Congress blocks the administration’s plans to eliminate the department.

Proponents of the changes say they want to streamline operations, save taxpayer money, spread the economic effects of federal jobs beyond the nation’s capital and bring workers closer to the people they serve.

Opponents of the USDA’s move, including Democratic lawmakers and unions representing federal workers, say the agencies will hemorrhage talent because many scientists and researchers would rather quit than move their families 1,000 miles from the District.

[Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job]

Capital region lawmakers say both of the administration’s proposals are part of a long-standing Republican campaign, bolstered by President Trump, to paint federal workers as unnecessary bureaucrats.

“In the White House, there is, among some people, a real disrespect for federal employees, animated by their disrespect for the government generally,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes part of Prince George’s County, said in a brief interview. “So if you’re hostile to government, you’re then . . . hostile to those who work in government.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents most of Fairfax and Prince William counties, said an “unrelenting assault” on benefits, compensation, hiring, workers’ rights, workplace conditions and appellate rights started when Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

“The Republicans, and especially the Trump administration, view the entire federal enterprise, federal workers, as part of the swamp, and anything they can do to diminish it, demean it, from their point of view is a good thing,” Connolly said.

He pointed to a March 2017 resolution spearheaded by Republican Jason Chaffetz of Utah, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that would have deemed it unnecessary for federal agencies to be located in the District. The measure, called Divest D.C., advanced to the full House but never got a floor vote.

Current efforts appear to be moving ahead unabated, raising concerns among federal workers that the administration could try to replicate the plans across government.

“It seems like if they are successful here, this could just be the tip of the iceberg,” said Sandra Salstrom, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers. “We don’t know who’s next.”

Connolly is chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s panel on government operations, which in May held a three-hour hearing titled “The Administration’s War on a Merit Based Civil Service.”

The hearing focused on the administration’s plans to move most Office of Personnel Management functions into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. The plan also would shift leadership to the executive branch, raising worries that the agency could become politicized.

The OPM-GSA merger was the subject of a rally last week organized by federal worker unions across from the current OPM headquarters.

In addition to Connolly and Hoyer, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate, took turns at the microphone in the shadow of a statue of Argentine independence hero José de San Martín.

Plans to move the USDA agencies — the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science — to Kansas City intensified Democrats’ frustration.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) of Montgomery County has tried to stop the USDA move through a bill and an amendment, and he sits on a committee that could block the leases on new office space if the contracts exceed a certain threshold.

He suggested the move was part of an ongoing effort by the administration to suppress scientific data on climate change.

“I will use every tool I have on both the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee to block this move,” he said in a statement.

The USDA Office of Inspector General began a review of the relocation in November at the request of Norton and Hoyer. The report is under review by the agency before its release to Congress and the public.

Kevin Hunt, a geographer and head of his union bargaining unit at the Economic Research Service, is a Missouri native but does not plan to move.

He said he is sad to leave what he considers a “dream job” that allows him to do research and publish in scientific journals, pays well and has promotion potential. His partner has a good job elsewhere, making it difficult to move.

Hunt said he believes the agency belongs in the District, where collaboration with other agencies is seamless.

“It’s not about Kansas City,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s about moving people who are established here and who are at the top of their game.”

Lawmakers have inserted language into multiple appropriations bills to block the administration from spending money to move workers in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

However, the changes are on track to begin before the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, which prompted Norton to suggest litigation as a next step. The basis for a legal challenge is unclear.

“I’ve got to be absolutely candid with you,” she told workers at the rally. “I am going to ask you to go into court. . . . I’m standing here this afternoon to say, ‘If we don’t beat them, I am sure that you will beat them. Keep fighting. We are there with you!’”

She added in an interview: “I think we have done everything we can do. We’re racing against the clock.”

Asked about litigation, an AFGE spokesman said they are pursuing collective bargaining to block or delay the moves.

Trump administration to print 2020 Census without citizenship question,https://www.10tv.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.10tv.com/article/trump-administration-print-2020-census-without-citizenship-question-2019-jul,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Days after the U.S. Supreme Court halted the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday started printing the questionnaire without the controversial query.

Trump administration attorneys notified parties in lawsuits challenging the question that the printing of the hundreds of millions of documents for the 2020 counts had started, said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco confirmed there would be ""no citizenship question on 2020 census.""

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while he respected the Supreme Court's decision, he strongly disagreed with it.

""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question,"" Ross said in a statement. ""My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.""

President Donald Trump had said after the high court's decision last week that he would ask his attorneys about possibly delaying next spring's decennial census, raising questions about whether printing of the census materials would start as planned this month.

""The Supreme Court's ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said in an email.

Opponents of the citizenship question said it would discourage participation by immigrants and residents who are in the country illegally, potentially providing inaccurate figures for a count that determines the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending and how many congressional districts each state gets.

""Everyone in America counts in the census, and today's decision means we all will,"" said Dale Ho, who argued the Supreme Court case as director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project."

This new tool cuts VA disability claims’ processing time in half,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/digital-va-disability-claims-tool-form-526ez/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

Veterans looking to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities can now use a self-service online tool developed by the U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The new tool, built in partnership by the digital team (DSVA), the VA’s Office of Information Technology and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), aims to make it easier for veterans to submit disability claims to the agency. And it comes with a side benefit for all involved: It’s reportedly decreasing the overall adjudication times for claims.

The Disability Compensation Claim Tool is a new digital front end for the form 526EZ, a deeply bureaucratic 12-page document that begins with seven pages of instructions. In it, veterans are called upon to describe their service-connected injuries neatly and in a small table — a process that can be as taxing as it is confusing.

The new digital version is designed such that veterans can “get through the process easily and understand what’s happening,” Andrea Schneider, product lead at DSVA, told FedScoop in an interview. It’s not just an online version of the old paper form — it’s a revamped experience that guides veterans through the process, asking user-friendly questions and using the answers to populate a regular 526EZ on the backend. In a sense, the tool works to translate the kind of plain language a veteran would use into the bureaucratic officialese that claims adjudicators require.

“We don’t need the veteran to be an expert in our administrative processes,” Paul Shute, chief of operational innovation at the VBA’s Compensation Service, told FedScoop.

As always, DSVA emphasized user-centered design in building the tool, talking with “hundreds” of veterans to unveil their needs and testing an early version of the tool beginning in August 2018, the team said. The final version, which fully launched in March, is the culmination of about two years of “solid, dedicated effort,” Schneider told FedScoop.

“It’s been a labor of love,” she added.

But the tool isn’t just easier — it’s also faster. Before launch, the average disability claims processing time was somewhere between 108 and 120 days (FedScoop got differing feedback on this). The majority of that time, Shute told FedScoop, was spent gathering evidence — often in a back-and-forth between the veteran and the adjudicator. The new tool’s use of conditional logic and data integration has already managed, on average, to cut that time in half, the team said. Since March, there have been more than 10,000 claims submissions sent through the tool.

“It’s been an incredible project,” Schneider said. “It’s been impactful from a service perspective, feeling like we’re really able to touch people’s lives and make them a little bit better.”

The new tool is the latest in the VA’s continued focus on putting its veteran “customers” first. In November 2018 the agency launched a new version of VA.gov, one that puts veteran service front and center. And in May the agency officially added customer experience to its “Core Values and Characteristics” — the guidelines in the the Code of Federal Regulations that define priorities of VA employees as well as what the agency stands for.

“We depend on Veterans, their caregivers, and our business partners to help us form the vision of an improved Veteran experience,” James Gfrerer, CIO at the VA, said in a statement emailed to FedScoop. “Human-centered design, powered by IT, is transforming VA.”"
EPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451618-epa-moving-ahead-with-plan-to-phase-out-animal-testing-report,"The Intercept reported Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to push ahead with a plan to phase out animal lab testing, which is raising concerns among some public health and environmental advocates who say the testing is needed to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals.

EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report EPA's backward accounting protects polluters, not the people Overnight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project MORE signaled the agency will slash funding on experiments tested on mammals in half by 2025 and look to stop using mammal studies for the approval of new chemicals by 2035, in an internal department memo reviewed by The Intercept.

The EPA, however, is denying The Intercept's report that it is looking to phase out animal testing, calling it inaccurate. It did acknowledge it is seeking to reduce and replace animal testing requirements.

""Though, EPA does look to announce sometime soon agency goals to reduce the number of animals impacted by EPA testing. Human health will be fully protected under any final EPA policy goal to reduce reliance on animal testing,"" an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""EPA can protect human health and simultaneously reduce, replace, and refine animal testing requirements.""

According to The Intercept, the EPA is looking to use alternative methods to animal testing, such as computer modeling and tests on cells, to measure chemical toxicity.

However, scientists warn that the alternatives are not yet able to replicate mammal studies for regulation — which many say is the reason the federal agency is looking to make the policy change, The Intercept reports.

""EPA is well aware that these cells don’t replicate human metabolism. So when it comes to bioactivation, they’re going to miss all that — and they know that,"" Thomas Zoeller, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the health effects of man-made chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls, told The Intercept."
Trump says U.S. should start manipulating the dollar,https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Martin Crutsinger', 'Associated Press', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/03/trump-currency-manipulation/39651281/,"President Trump is accusing China and Europe of playing a ""big currency manipulation game."" (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)

Washington – President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China and Europe of playing a “big currency manipulation game.” He said the United States should match that effort, a move that directly contradicts official U.S. policy not to manipulate the dollar’s value to gain trade advantages.

In a tweet, the president said if America doesn’t act, the country will continue “being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for so many years.”

Trump’s own Treasury Department in May found that no country meets the criteria of being labeled a currency manipulator, although the report did put China and eight other countries on a watch list.

A country manipulates its currency when it drives down the value to make its exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive.

As a candidate in 2016, Trump repeatedly charged that China was manipulating its currency and as president he would immediately label China as a currency manipulator.

However, after taking office, Trump’s Treasury Department has issued five reports on the subject, required by law every six months. In each report it said no country met the criteria to be labeled a currency manipulator.

Trump’s tweet seemed to have no impact in currency markets, a situation that would likely change if Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began threatening to use currency manipulation to drive down the dollar’s value.

The Treasury secretary has the job of commenting on the dollar’s value and also implementing intervention to buy or sell dollars in currency markets to influence the dollar’s value. U.S. administrations for decades have pledged in international communiques not to intervene in currency markets for the purpose of influencing trade flows.

A weaker dollar would boost U.S. exports but could run the risk of causing foreign investors who are helping to finance the federal government’s $22 trillion national debt to move their investments elsewhere to avoid the risk of currency depreciation lowering their returns.

Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."

Franklin, 73, grew up on Long Island, New York, and spent his summers on nearby Fire Island working at the illustrious Talisman Yacht Club, home to the jet set of the 1960s. There he learned the ins and outs of the food and beverage service industry and how to interact with the rich and famous, including Marilyn Monroe, who rented a house just a few doors down from Franklin.

Franklin didn't know it, but his experience on Fire Island and at the yacht club helped prepare him to later serve some of the most powerful men in the world.

Franklin was drafted for the Vietnam War shortly after graduating high school and decided to join the Air Force because ""it was the only branch of the military where the enlisted men weren't the primary resource being shot — instead they went for the officers,"" he said.

His first assignment was working in a mess hall near missile bases in South Dakota. Franklin then became a member of an in-flight B-52 kitchen crew based in Guam and eventually made his way to Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., as a member of the 89th Airlift Wing, the unit that operates Air Force One.

When Franklin was promoted to the crew of Air Force One in 1976, it was toward the end of Gerald Ford's administration, and he was told he might not have a job in six months when a new president took office.

However, not only did Franklin serve Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, he remained on the flight crew during the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, making Franklin the first and only Air Force One flight attendant to serve five consecutive presidents.

""I was in the right place at the right time and I was capable, mentally and physically, of doing what they needed me to do,"" he said.

One of Franklin's major responsibilities was planning and grocery shopping for all of the meals served aboard Air Force One. It was a job that was part-culinary, part-security because it was up to him to ensure that none of the food was poisoned.

""The flight attendants would shop in civilian clothes because we didn't want anybody to know who we were, and we would never go to the same store,"" Franklin said. ""Our primary responsibility was not only to give good service, but to make sure the food and anything on that airplane — drinks, snacks, candy, mouthwash, toothpaste, whatever — had not been tampered with.""

Franklin served on Air Force One for a total of 18 years. He got to know everything about the presidents, from their favorite food (there was always a fresh jar of jelly beans for Reagan, and Bush had an affinity for pork rinds) to their preferred type of music (country for all except Clinton, who was ""a rock 'n roll guy""), Franklin said.

""Presidents are just like us; they cry, they feel, they hurt,"" he said. ""They get up in the morning, put their pants on in the morning and go to work.""

Sometimes, though, they need a little help getting up. Franklin recalled one trip when he had to wake up President Clinton after just two and a half hours of sleep. He tried to wake the president gently, but after a while he said bluntly, ""Sir, it's time to get your butt out of bed and go to work,"" Franklin said.

""He's the only guy I would have said that to,"" Franklin said with a laugh. ""Hillary thought it was hilarious and started laughing, so I turned to her and said, 'What are you laughing at? You're next!'""

The stories enthralled guests at the airport party.

Christopher Rozansky, Naples Airport Authority executive director, said the anniversary is a historic milestone for the airport, which is updating its master plan for the first time in 20 years.

""So often we focus on the work that needs to be done that we don't take the time to reflect on where we've come from or the accomplishments we've achieved,"" Rozansky said.

Some of those accomplishments include ushering in 150,000 visitors each year and boasting an economic impact of $440.1 million, according to a Florida Department of Transportation report released this year.

Rozansky said the Airport Authority plans on celebrating its 50th anniversary with events throughout the rest of the year, including an appreciation party for airport customers and an inaugural 5K on the runway Oct. 5 to benefit the Experimental Aircraft Association's youth program.

""Our mission is to connect people in Naples,"" he said, ""and as more and more people move to Southwest Florida, that mission is more important than ever.""

Justice Department watchdog to investigate decision to cancel FBI headquarters plan,https://www.grandforksherald.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/nation/2993992-Justice-Department-watchdog-to-investigate-decision-to-cancel-FBI-headquarters-plan,"WASHINGTON - The Justice Department's inspector general will investigate the FBI's role in dropping plans a decade in the making to move its headquarters to the Washington suburbs, he told Congress in a letter Tuesday.

The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told House committee leaders that he is initiating a review of actions at the DOJ and FBI that led to the canceling of the plans in favor of building a smaller replacement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown and dispersing other FBI staff elsewhere.

The review could produce new revelations about the Trump administration's stunning reversal of bipartisan plans for the development of a new, highly secure campus that would have gotten the bureau out of the fast-deteriorating Hoover building.

Democratic leaders of two committees, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) of the Oversight Committee and Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) and Dina Titus (Nev.) of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have pressed Horowitz to investigate. They redoubled their efforts after the head of the General Services Administration was found by her agency's inspector general to have made potentially misleading comments to Congress about the White House's involvement in the decision-making.

Democrats allege that Trump used the decision to put his own financial interests ahead of the needs of the FBI and taxpayers, which administration officials deny. The GSA is the landlord to Trump's D.C. hotel, located just down the street from the Hoover building, and redeveloping the Hoover site could introduce a new hotel competitor. Trump also told The Washington Post before running for office that he was considering bidding for the FBI project as well.

Under Trump, the FBI and GSA have both resisted responding to document requests made by Democrats on the Hill, though in a statement GSA officials said the agency ""has produced more than 90,000 pages in response to respective Congressional Committee requests on FBI and the Old Post Office building since 2017.""

In a statement, the House committee leaders said: ""For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration's sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President's namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions,""

In April testimony to Congress, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended the decision to keep the headquarters in downtown Washington and reaffirmed it as his preference. ""It is absolutely the FBI's view, the FBI's choice, the FBI's preference to build a new building . . . at our current location,"" he said.

For a decade before Trump's election, the FBI had been working with the GSA and Congress on the suburban headquarters plan. Citing security concerns with staying downtown and lack of large development sites nearby, the FBI and GSA pursued large plots of land near the Capital Beltway and suburban Metro stations, ultimately narrowing its search to sites in Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland and Springfield, Va.

But six months into the Trump administration, the FBI and GSA ditched those plans and then last year announced they preferred to keep a smaller downtown headquarters and move 2,300 headquarters staff members out of the Washington area altogether - to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

GSA chief Emily Murphy testified that Wray - not Trump or a White House official - asked that the FBI remain downtown if possible, downplaying any White House role in the decision-making.

The FBI backed her assertion, but the inspector general found that Murphy's testimony was incomplete and possibly misleading about the White House's involvement, including an Oval Office meeting with Trump about the project that she omitted. Murphy denied misleading Congress, maintaining that the decision about where to put the FBI was made before that meeting.

The GSA maintains that the government could see cost savings under the new plan, but federal real estate experts have said the government's expectations of cost savings weren't likely to come true based on unrealistic expectations on the administration's part about how little its plan will cost. The GSA inspector general found that the Trump administration plan could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more and accommodate 2,300 fewer employees.

Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

Trump Defends Border Patrol as Criticism of Detention Conditions Grows,https://www.wsj.com,"['Andrew Duehren', 'Andrew.Duehren Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-chief-denounces-social-media-posts-by-border-patrol-group-11562174365,"WASHINGTON—President Trump defended Border Patrol agents’ handling of a surge of Central Americans seeking asylum, as Congress intensifies its scrutiny over his administration’s treatment of migrants in its custody and a scandal over a private Facebook group.

“Our Border Patrol people are not hospital workers, doctors or nurses,” Mr. Trump tweeted Wednesday. “Great job by Border Patrol, above and beyond. Many of these illegals [sic] aliens are living far better now than where they…came from.”

Making Sense of the USDA’s Planted Acres Report,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/successful-marketing/making-sense-of-the-usdas-planted-acres-report,"The USDA report last week was one of the better curveballs we have seen in the past few years. Traders were expecting to see corn acres near 86.6 million. The USDA reported corn acres at 91.7 million acres. How could this be close at all?

Well, the USDA did say that the 91.7 was acres planted and intended to plant. So, the report last week felt more like a combination of the March planting intentions report and the June planted acreage report. The extremely wet spring was noted as reason the USDA will resurvey planted acres. Those results will be announced in the August 12 monthly supply and demand report.

Corn prices had a wild few minutes just after the crop report was released last Friday. Prices had a 31¢ range in the first five minutes. The bearishness of the acres was enough that corn actually traded limit down for a short time.

The holiday-shortened week was slightly concerning for many traders as they were expecting light volume. The bears could have easily pushed prices through support, however, that did not happen. December corn futures have managed to hold major support so far. Read the Successful Marketing Newsletter to see where those support levels sit."
Trump tweet breaks Interior Department webpage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-tweet-breaks-interior-department-webpage,"A tweet from President Trump’s account generated so much web traffic to the Department of Interior’s press release regarding Fourth of July celebrations that it broke the webpage.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.
