"Opinion | President Trump, Come to Willmar",https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas L. Friedman'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/opinion/trump-willmar-minnesota.html,"There is still plenty of residual opposition to Calvin’s openness to immigrants. And in Minnesota generally new immigrants will tell you that the front-end integration of East Africans, Asians and other minorities has probably gone more smoothly than anyone expected, but breaking through to the top has been more difficult. There, things have not been so “Minnesota nice.” Rising professionals of color are still leaving Minnesota, on balance, because they don’t feel welcome or have encountered persistent racial barriers to advancement.

Like I said, it’s a work in progress, much more needs to be done, and it will not be easy. But given the number of people here who want to get caught trying, and the power of America’s melting pot, I am hopeful. Two stories drove that home to me.

The first was from Calvin. He told me he was recently vacationing at Hershey Park in Pennsylvania and stopped at a Pizza Hut where a dark-skinned man was at the cash register. “We started talking and he asked me where I was from. And I said ‘Willmar.’ He jumped up and hugged me and said he was Somali and that ‘Willmar is my hometown.’ I thought, ‘Maybe we’ve got something good going here.’”

The other story was from Hamse Warfa, the Somali entrepreneur and state work force official. He came with me to Willmar, and on the drive back to Minneapolis I asked him if his son had gotten into Minnesota sports. Warfa answered: “My son is 10 years old and I ask him if he is interested in soccer. He says ‘no,’ he’s all about the Vikings.”

William Barr Assignment of John Durham to Look at Russia Probe Sends Chilling Message to FBI for Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Barbara Mcquade'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/william-barr-assignment-of-john-durham-to-look-at-russia-probe-sends-chilling-message-to-fbi-for-trump,"If you come at the king, you best not miss.

That’s the message Attorney General William Barr is sending to FBI agents, whether intentionally or not. Barr has authorized yet another investigation into the FBI’s conduct probing links between Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. Even though two other entities are already investigating the same matter, reports indicate that Barr has appointed Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia probe.

In doing so, Barr is playing into the hands of President Donald Trump, who has already characterized Durham’s assignment as an investigation into “ how that whole hoax got started.”

The most charitable interpretation of Barr’s behavior in defense of Trump is that he believes strongly in a “unitary executive,” where the president can order any investigation he wants. But in his quest to protect the presidency, Barr is damaging our national security. His complicity in Trump’s efforts to disparage the FBI will make it more difficult for agents to do their jobs and could discourage investigations of those in power.

Certainly, the FBI, like any other government agency, should be subject to scrutiny. If you were to ask most FBI agents about internal investigations, they would tell you that they welcome such probes when done in good faith because they ensure not only accountability but also public trust.

Following the FBI’s aggressive surveillance of civil rights activists and war protesters in the 1960s and ’70s, safeguards and approval requirements were created to prevent such abuses. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was created to provide independent oversight of wiretaps conducted in the name of national security. The Domestic Investigations Operations Guide was created to provide detailed operational and approval requirements for each investigative step. FBI personnel are subject to DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates allegations of misconduct. The FBI also has its own inspection division to conduct routine audits of compliance with polices and practices.

“ Failing to investigate Russian interference would have been a breach of the FBI’s duty. ”

But the current outcry about the use of FISA surveillance and informants to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election is not sufficient predication for a criminal investigation. Those techniques are routinely and appropriately used in counterintelligence investigations against foreign adversaries. Former FBI general counsel James Baker has been speaking out about the FBI’s work on the Russia investigation, stating that the investigation not a “coup” against President Trump, but instead was “about Russia. It was always about Russia. Full stop.” Failing to investigate Russian interference would have been a breach of the FBI’s duty.

Even use of the so-called Steele dossier in the FISA application for surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page is not the scandal that some describe. The dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent to be used as opposition research by Hillary Clinton’s campaign against Trump, was properly described as such in the FISA application, such that the FISA court had complete and accurate information when it authorized the surveillance. Judges, including those on the FISA court, are capable of discounting information based on potential biases as long as they are disclosed in the application, as they were here.

In addition, material from the Steele dossier provided only a portion of the facts included in the 66-page application that was used to establish probable cause to obtain surveillance authorization from the FISA court. Renewals of the application were approved from Trump-appointed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. There is no evidence in the public record that the FBI abused the FISA process in this investigation.

Nonetheless, last year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to investigate potential abuses in the FISA process following complaints by Republican lawmakers. Sessions later asked Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber to pursue any criminal conduct relating to the same matter, along with other matters relating to Clinton.

It is unclear why Barr does not simply await those results rather than appoint a new prosecutor to undertake another investigation. If Barr had wanted to expand the scope of the prior investigations, he could have done so without appointing a new investigator. If he were simply replacing Huber with Durham, who, by all accounts is a highly respected and experienced investigator, then he should say so.

Instead, Barr has created the appearance that he is launching another investigation to appease Trump. But there is a significant downside to such a tactic. Barr’s appointment of Durham advances the Trump narrative that the FBI is run by a “deep state” that is engaged in a witch hunt and a hoax.

Barr has already contributed to the partisan conspiracy theory with the language he used at his press conference to announce the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report in April. Barr repeatedly used Trump’s talking point of “no collusion,” a term Mueller specifically said he was avoiding. Barr made things worse in his subsequent congressional testimony, when he used the word “spying” to describe the FBI’s tactics in the Russia probe. Despite his protestations that the word is not a pejorative term, and that “spying” is a word used by the media, it is not a word that government officials use to describe court-authorized surveillance.

Contrast Barr’s performances with the recent congressional testimony of FBI Director Christopher Wray. Wray rejected Barr’s use of the term “spying” as “not the term I would use.” Wray also stated that he did not have any evidence of any illegal surveillance into the Trump campaign. Trump responded by tweeting: “The FBI has no leadership . . . The Director is protecting the same gang . . . that tried to . . . overthrow the President through an illegal coup.”

Even after seeing this treatment, Barr continues to appease Trump, who campaigns on the narrative that he is victim of the deep state. Trump has called the FBI “a disgrace” that is “in tatters.” Harming the reputation of the FBI will make it more difficult for the FBI do the important work it does every day. When an agent knocks on a door for tips in a kidnaping case, will the resident help someone from an agency the president has warned him about? When an FBI agent testifies at the trial of a sex trafficker, will a juror trust that he is telling the truth? By disparaging the FBI, the president makes our country less safe. Barr is compounding the problem by contributing to this false narrative.

In addition to harming the effectiveness of the FBI, Barr’s complicity in Trump’s tactics may also have a chilling effect. By advancing the “investigate the investigators” mantra, Barr may cause the FBI to flinch next time it perceives a threat from powerful people within the government. He is incentivizing the FBI to sit idly by in the face of national security threats. The risk is that under Barr’s leadership, the FBI’s new motto might become “he who does nothing does nothing wrong.”"
Skeptical U.S. Allies Resist Trump’s New Claims of Threats From Iran,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Helene Cooper', 'Edward Wong']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html,"All are concerns that have been leveled against Iranian forces for years.

“We are aware of their presence clearly and we monitor them along with a whole range of others because of the environment we are in,” General Ghika said.

But he said, “No, there has been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq or Syria.”

Intelligence and military officials in Europe as well as in the United States said that over the past year, most aggressive moves have originated not in Tehran, but in Washington — where John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, has prodded President Trump into backing Iran into a corner.

One American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential internal planning, said the new intelligence of an increased Iranian threat was “small stuff” and did not merit the military planning being driven by Mr. Bolton. The official also said the ultimate goal of the yearlong economic sanctions campaign by the Trump administration was to draw Iran into an armed conflict with the United States.

Since May 2018, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the major powers agreement that curbed Iran’s nuclear program, reimposed punishing sanctions on Tehran, demanded that allies choose between Iranian oil and doing business in the American market, and declared the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a terrorist organization.

And on Tuesday, the State Department appeared on the verge of ordering a partial evacuation of the American Embassy in Baghdad as a heightened security measure, according to people familiar with the plans."

Mitt Romney's vote was just his latest break with the president. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP File Photo Congress Romney rejects Trump judicial pick who smeared Obama

Mitt Romney was the only Republican senator to vote against one of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees on Tuesday. And he did so in part to defend former President Barack Obama.

Romney cast the lone GOP ""no"" vote against Michael Truncale, who was confirmed 49-46 on Tuesday morning to the Eastern District of Texas. Truncale called Obama an ""un-American imposter"" in June 2011, and explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was ""merely expressing frustration by what I perceived as a lack of overt patriotism on behalf of President Obama."" He also said he believed Obama was born in Hawaii and did not subscribe to ""birtherism,"" a racist theory that the president was not an American citizen.

Story Continued Below

But all that wasn't a good enough explanation for Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee.

""He made particularly disparaging comments about President Obama. And as the Republican nominee for president, I just couldn't subscribe to that in a federal judge,"" Romney said in a brief interview. ""This was not a matter of qualifications or politics. This was something specifically to that issue as a former nominee of our party.""

Romney's vote was just his latest break with the president on everything from his national emergency declaration to his plans to nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve. Though he backs Trump more often than not, he's one of the Republicans most inclined to break with the president.

"Trump’s Tariffs, Once Seen as Leverage, May Be Here to Stay",https://www.nytimes.com,['Ana Swanson'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/trump-tariffs-china.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s tariffs were initially seen as a cudgel to force other countries to drop their trade barriers. But they increasingly look like a more permanent tool to shelter American industry, block imports and banish an undesirable trade deficit.

More than two years into the Trump administration, the United States has emerged as a nation with the highest tariff rate among developed countries, outranking Canada, Germany and France, as well as China, Russia and Turkey. And with further trade confrontations brewing, the rate may only increase from here.

On Tuesday, the president continued to praise his trade war with China, saying that the 25 percent tariffs he imposed on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods would benefit the United States, and that he was looking “very strongly” at imposing additional levies on nearly every Chinese import.

“I think it’s going to turn out extremely well. We’re in a very strong position,” Mr. Trump said in remarks from the White House lawn. “Our economy is fantastic; theirs is not so good. We’ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election; they’ve gone way down since my election.”"

""Horrifying. I’m not saying Trump is becoming Hitler, so don’t bother tweeting the distinctions,"" he tweeted alongside pictures of Trump and Hitler sharing similar physical gestures.

""But the physical and behavioral resemblances aren’t altogether irrelevant. No prior president even suggests the comparison,"" he added.

Tribe was retweeting a post from @wvjoe911 who quoted Voltaire, the 18th Century French philosopher, implying that both Hitler and Trump made absurd statements. ""Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities,"" the quote read.

State Department's red flag on Steele went to a senior FBI man well before FISA warrant,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/443710-state-departments-red-flag-on-steele-went-to-a-senior-fbi-man-well-before,"In all Washington investigations, the essential questions become who knew it and when did they know it.

In the case of FBI informant Christopher Steele and the credibility of his now-disproven Russia collusion allegations against Donald Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi to meet with Lighthizer amid trade tensions GOP lawmaker slams Pelosi over response to Tlaib controversy Alabama Senate votes to ban almost all abortions, sending measure to governor's desk MORE, we have some important clarity: Government officials confirm that an October 2016 email revealing that Steele met with State Department officials — a breach of protocol for an informant if it was unauthorized — was sent to an FBI counterintelligence supervisor.

ADVERTISEMENT

Multiple sources confirm to me that the recipient of the State Department email was Special Agent Stephen Laycock, then the FBI’s section chief for Eurasian counterintelligence and now one of the bureau’s top executives as the assistant director for intelligence under Director Christopher Wray.

The email to Laycock from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec arrived eight days before the FBI swore to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that it had no derogatory information on Steele and used his anti-Trump dossier to secure a secret surveillance warrant to investigate Trump’s possible ties to Moscow.

Officials tell me that Laycock immediately forwarded the information he received about Steele on Oct. 13, 2016, to the FBI team leading the Trump-Russia investigation, headed by then-fellow Special Agent Peter Strzok.

Laycock was the normal point of contact for Kavalec on Eurasian counterintelligence matters, and he simply acted as a conduit to get the information to his colleagues supervising the Russia probe, the officials added.

The officials declined to say what the FBI did with the information about Steele after it reached Strzok’s team, or what the email specifically revealed. A publicly disclosed version of the email has been heavily redacted in the name of national security.

While much remains to be answered, the email exchange means FBI supervisors knew Steele had contact with State and had reason to inquire what he was saying before they sought the warrant. If they had inquired, agents would have learned Steele had admitted to Kavalec he had been leaking to the news media, had a political deadline of Election Day to get his information public and had provided demonstrably false intelligence in one case, as I reported last week.

Current and former FBI officials told me it would be a red flag for an FBI informant on a sensitive counterintelligence case such as Russia to go talking about his evidence with another federal agency without authorization.

Kevin Brock, the former FBI assistant director for intelligence, said the State Department’s email in October 2016 ordinarily should have triggered the FBI to re-evaluate Steele as a source. “This is quite important,” Brock said. “Under normal circumstances, when you get information about the conduct of your source that gives rise to questions about their reliability or truthfulness, you usually go back and re-evaluate their dependability and credibility.

“It doesn’t always mean immediate discontinuation of the source. But there are policy requirements that you exercise some form of prudence, and conduct further vetting to determine whether this source can be utilized going forward. This is particularly true if the source’s information is being used in an affidavit or some other legal process.”

FBI confidential sources such as Steele sign a confidentiality agreement and undergo a training session on the dos and don’ts of informing, an event known in intelligence parlance as an “admonishment.” FBI records show Steele underwent “admonishment” training and signed an acknowledgement on Feb. 2, 2016.

The FBI fired Steele as an informant on Nov. 1, 2016, claiming he was caught leaking to the news media. But by that time Steele’s intelligence already had been used as the main evidence to secure a FISA warrant against the Trump campaign on Oct. 21, 2016.

The public version of Kavalec's email blacked out Laycock’s name as the recipient and listed an attachment file when it was delivered last month to the conservative group Citizens United under an open records request. The blacked-out version contained only a single visible sentence, in which Kavalec wrote the FBI supervisor: “You may already have this information but wanted to pass it on just in case.”

Officials familiar with Kavalec’s email would only describe the contents as having to do with something Steele told the State Department during an Oct. 11, 2016, visit. They said the attachment was not a copy of Steele’s now-infamous dossier or a complete set of Kavalec’s typed notes from her conversation with the informant. Rather, they say, it was information Steele shared with Kavalec that she felt needed to be transmitted to the bureau.

The officials also declined to address another mystery that has caught congressional investigators’ attention: Kavalec had two exchanges with FBI officials about Steele approximately two weeks before her meeting. The email contacts on Sept. 29-30, 2016, have been redacted, except for a single phrase “Thank you Kathy.” Congressional investigators want to know if the earlier exchange resulted in Kavalec learning in advance of Steele’s work for the FBI, or was a further tipoff to the FBI of Steele’s intention to visit State, a department where he had offered pro bono information in the past.

An FBI spokeswoman declined comment. Laycock did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. State officials declined to discuss the documents.

Republican House and Senate investigators who spent two years reviewing the Russia case say they were not provided the details of Kavalec’s contact with Steele or told about the existence of her handwritten and typed notes.

Lawmakers believe the new memos provide additional evidence Steele was unsuitable to be an informant before his dossier was used to justify a Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant.

Their concern is heightened by the fact that Steele was working simultaneously as an FBI informant and as a paid researcher for Fusion GPS, the firm hired by Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton3 Florida radio stations to broadcast Trump speeches every hour until 2020 election State Department's red flag on Steele went to a senior FBI man well before FISA warrant Maine Senate passes bill that would give Electoral College votes to winner of national popular vote MORE’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee to find Russia dirt on Trump in hopes of defeating him in the election.

Congressional Republicans have said publicly for months that the FBI failed to adequately inform FISA judges that Steele was working for Trump’s rival and had a bias against the GOP nominee, or that his dossier was unverified and contained demonstrably false information.

Defenders of the FBI have countered that there isn’t evidence to prove the bureau knew Steele was leaking to the media or was hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC until after the FISA warrant was filed.

Justice Department says FDA ‘lacks jurisdiction’ over death-penalty drugs,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Laurie Mcginley', 'Reporter Covering Health', 'Mark Berman', 'National News Reporter', 'May At Pm', 'Laurie Mcginley Covers Health', 'Medicine For The Washington Post.

The department’s Office of Legal Counsel said that “articles intended for use in capital punishment by a state or the federal government cannot be regulated as ‘drugs’ or ‘devices.’ ”

The legal opinion, issued this month, comes as states have struggled in recent years to obtain drugs for lethal injections, which remain the country’s primary method of execution even as the number of executions has declined.

In 2015, the FDA blocked Texas from importing shipments of an anesthetic from an overseas distributor, finalizing the decision two years later. The agency argued the importation was illegal because the drug, sodium thiopental, was not approved in the United States and was improperly labeled. It also cited a 2012 federal injunction barring the agency from allowing the drug’s importation.

Texas responded to the FDA’s move by suing the agency in early 2017, claiming the agency was interfering with the state’s responsibility to carry out its law enforcement duties. The lawsuit was filed shortly before President Trump took office. Trump has long been a supporter of capital punishment. while his Senate-confirmed attorneys general — Jeff Sessions, who left the post last year, and William P. Barr, who assumed the job this year — have also backed the practice.

The legal opinion from the Justice Department this month sides against the FDA and with Texas. It says that drugs intended for executions are different from any others, noting that “they exclusively inflict harm” and “are not intended to produce any benefit for the end user.” It expressly highlights “the narrowness of our conclusion,” saying that it does not address whether the FDA “has jurisdiction over drugs intended for use in physician-assisted suicide.”

But it also takes a broad view of the issues at hand, arguing that if the FDA had jurisdiction over drugs meant for executions, it would have similar power over other areas — such as firearms — which the agency has not sought to regulate.

The Justice Department’s opinion is unlikely to have any immediate effect, however, because the FDA is still operating under the 2012 injunction. It is not clear whether the Justice Department will seek to have that injunction lifted, a move that could spark a long legal tussle.

The opinion seems aimed at “giving a green light” to corrections officials to look abroad for drugs needed for executions, said Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University and a death-penalty expert.

“I think this has very broad ramifications, unfortunately,” Denno said in an interview. “This is intended to allow departments of corrections to access drugs outside the country because they’re having so much difficulty doing so.”

While European companies have objected to their products being used in executions, corrections officials could have more luck turning to countries such as China or India, Denno said. “It has the potential to open the floodgates,” she said.

The Texas attorney general’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The legal opinion was issued after a protracted battle between the FDA and the Justice Department over the regulation of lethal injection drugs.

More than a year ago, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had a heated argument in the White House Situation Room, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Sessions wanted the FDA to allow drugs used for executions to enter the country without undergoing agency scrutiny. Gottlieb refused, saying that such a move could undermine the agency’s authority. Gottlieb left the agency in April, six months after Sessions left the Justice Department. Both Sessions and Gottlieb declined to comment.

States’ difficulties in obtaining lethal injection drugs stem from drug companies’ objections to having their products used in executions.

For many years, states relied on a combination of three drugs to carry out death sentences: an anesthetic, such as sodium thiopental; a paralytic; and a product meant to stop inmates’ hearts. But Hospira, maker of sodium thiopental, said in 2011 that it would stop manufacturing the product, a decision the company attributed to its use in executions.

In the years that followed, states began turning to new combinations and execution protocols. Nebraska last year became the first state to use fentanyl in an execution, combining it with three other drugs to execute an inmate convicted of killing two Omaha cabdrivers. Other states debated or adopted options including nitrogen gas and firing squads.

The FDA, in defending its efforts to block states from importing unapproved sodium thiopental has cited the 2012 injunction relating to the drug.

That ruling came after death-row inmates filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, saying the FDA was acting unlawfully by exercising “enforcement discretion” to allow states to import unapproved sodium thiopental from an unregistered foreign facility.

Despite the 2012 order, however, states continued to order sodium thiopental from overseas. BuzzFeed News found that at least three states — Nebraska, Texas and Arizona — had tried to import drugs from a supplier in India despite getting warnings from the FDA in 2015.

The Texas lawsuit, filed in the waning days of the Obama administration, says the state alerted federal officials in June 2015 that its Department of Criminal Justice — which is responsible for the state’s executions — planned to “import thiopental sodium intended for law enforcement purposes.”

The lawsuit said the state’s “foreign distributor” shipped 1,000 vials of the drug to Houston in late July 2015, and not long after, the drugs were impounded. According to the FDA, the agency also impounded a shipment intended for Arizona that same year.

Texas officials said they had obtained the drugs legally and referred to the government’s actions as an “unjustified seizure.”

In April 2017, the FDA wrote a letter to Texas authorities saying that the agency could not admit the drugs.

Texas quickly filed an amended complaint, but in December, 2017, a federal judge in Texas stayed the case and later denied a motion to lift it.

The case remains stayed. A status conference had been scheduled for September 2018, but the Trump administration asked for a 90-day continuance and for the case to remain stayed, adding that Texas officials did not oppose that motion. The Trump administration wrote in that motion that the federal government had “internal deliberations” that could resolve the lawsuit in a way “that could allow this case to be resolved without additional litigation,” although it did not provide further details.

“William Barr’s tenure as attorney general is going to be — so far it has been, I would say — a pretty unmitigated disaster,” Robinson told ""Morning Joe"" on Tuesday.

Robinson went on to question whether Barr even believed his the DOJ's decision, saying that it was ""destabilizing.""

“Is this something that Barr actually believes? Is he again nullifying the president who wants to get rid of anything with President Obama’s name on it?"" he asked. ""It’s unclear. But it’s deeply disturbing, even if this ultimately fails, even if ultimately, you know, the ACA is upheld, it’s destabilizing.""

Mike Barnicle, journalist and frequent ""Morning Joe"" guest, criticized Democrats for giving the Justice Department two weeks to respond.

The DOJ won’t say why Rudy Giuliani hasn’t registered as a foreign agent under FARA law,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/why-isnt-rudy-giuliani-registered-as-a-foreign-agent-fara-lobbying-in-ukraine-a9289f19677e/,"Amid last week’s furor about Rudy Giuliani pledging to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — and Giuliani’s claim that he wanted to “meddl[e] in an investigation” regarding Biden’s son in Ukraine — was a small, buried detail that may yet unravel Giuliani’s entire plan.

Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, has worked in Ukraine since Trump’s inauguration, nominally as a security adviser to the city of Kharkiv with his firm Giuliani Partners. However, one of his local clients claimed last week that Giuliani provided far more than technical advice and a handful of photo-ops.

According to Ukrainian developer Pavel Fuks, Giuliani had been hired to work as a “lobbyist” for the government of Ukraine, as well as for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. “This is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the Times. The claim backs up local media coverage of the relationship, with one Ukrainian magazine writing that Fuks hired Giuliani in order to create an office in the U.S. for “supporting investment” in Kharkiv. As Mother Jones reported, Giuliani connected with Fuks via TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a New York-based company that has “advised Russian oligarchs and others with Kremlin ties.”

Giuliani denied Fuks’ claim, saying that Trump remains his “only client.” Giuliani didn’t respond to ThinkProgress’ questions on the matter, and ThinkProgress’ efforts to contact Fuks were unsuccessful.

If anyone needs to be investigated, it’s Rudy Giuliani. Rudy was “a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine” but failed to register under FARA. His clients, Pavel Fuks and Gennadiy Kernes, have reported ties to organized crime. How is he different than Manafort? https://t.co/O0ZdUkmoex — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) May 10, 2019

However, Fuks’ claim adds significant fuel to longstanding concerns about Giuliani’s decision not to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department — even as the agency goes to unprecedented lengths to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

FARA regulations, on the books since 1938, had remained an afterthought for decades. But thanks to Trump’s rise, and due especially to the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, FARA has seen new life. The DOJ already created a new task force to strengthen FARA, making sure that those working on behalf of foreign governments and officials disclose and detail their work with the DOJ, and prosecutors have shown a new willingness to finally enforce the regulations.

In just the past year, failing to register with FARA has tripped up former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former White House counsel Gregory Craig — both of whom were found guilty of failing to register their work on behalf of the former Ukrainian government. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA.

Giuliani, though, has thus far managed to escape scrutiny. And no one’s quite sure why.

Last September, months before Fuks claimed that Giuliani had been hired directly to lobby on behalf of Ukraine, a number of Democratic senators signed a letter to the DOJ requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA filings (or lack thereof). Giuliani admitted last year that he’d never filed a single FARA registration.

The senators specifically pointed to Giuliani’s work in Ukraine, including a press release linking Giuliani with Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, himself a former member of the party affiliated with ousted Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Both Manafort and Craig were indicted for failing to disclose FARA-related work on behalf of Yanukovych’s regime.

The senators writing to DOJ — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) — specifically singled out Giuliani’s work in Ukraine:

Giuliani’s work on behalf the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, whose mayor is a member of the Party of Regions is also concerning. The Ukrainian Party of Regions’ connections to the Russian Government and anti-democratic activity are well-documented. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who both served in senior roles on the President’s 2016 campaign team, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to criminal acts in part because of their work on behalf of this Russian-backed Ukrainian political party. Mr. Giuliani’s financial connection to the organization, the organization’s close ties with the Russian government, and Mr. Giuliani’s ongoing public advocacy against Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election raises further questions that warrant review.

And it’s not just Giuliani’s work in Ukraine. As the senators noted, Giuliani’s efforts at recruiting foreign clients — all while working closely with the sitting president — have spanned the globe. He’s represented the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, in its efforts to lift their Foreign Terrorist Organization designation from the State Department. He recently signed up with Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior, as The Daily Beast found. And, perhaps most notably, he wrote a remarkable letter to Romanian authorities, chastising the country’s prosecutor for being too effective at combating corruption — all while working at the behest of another lobbyist representing an official caught up in Romania’s anti-corruption dragnet.

But it was Giuliani’s misadventures in Ukraine that gained the most notoriety. And over the past week, the questions — about Giuliani’s aims, about who’s paying for his travel, about how much Trump knows — have only grown.

The DOJ, though, has been silent. As multiple staffers working for the Democratic senators told ThinkProgress, the DOJ never even bothered to reply to their inquiries about Giuliani’s FARA status.

“DOJ never responded to our letter,” a spokesperson for Udall told ThinkProgress. “However, we did confirm that they received it.”

As Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), another signatory of the letter requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA status, tweeted last Friday, “Giuliani has reportedly been paid by foreign [governments] + political parties, including in Ukraine, but FAILED to register as a foreign agent as the law requires. This is EXACTLY why I joined @SenatorTomUdall to ask DOJ to investigate. We never got a reply.”

Giuliani, unsurprisingly, has long denied any need to register as a foreign agent. Despite the fact that experts on FARA regulations have pointed to Giuliani’s foreign work time and again — both in terms of his speeches and political activities — as examples of FARA-related work, Giuliani has claimed that he’s not influencing American policy.

However, Giuliani also offered a caveat last week: “I don’t think I’m influencing American government except on behalf of my client to further an investigation.” That is, Giuliani admitted that he’s not working to “influence” U.S. policy — except when it comes to his client, the president of the United States.

It doesn’t appear concerns about FARA regulations will slow Giuliani’s work anytime soon. Despite calling off his trip to Ukraine — and despite Fuks’ claims that he has paperwork clarifying Giuliani’s work as a lobbyist in Ukraine — Giuliani has refused to acknowledge any issues with his work in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to FARA.

As he said on Friday, when it comes to Ukraine, “I’m going to make sure that nothing scuttles the investigation that I want.”"
DOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/443712-doj-requests-to-appeal-rulings-advancing-dems-emoluments-clause,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday requested that a judge allow a higher court review previous rulings in favor of a lawsuit alleging President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi to meet with Lighthizer amid trade tensions GOP lawmaker slams Pelosi over response to Tlaib controversy Alabama Senate votes to ban almost all abortions, sending measure to governor's desk MORE has violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.

The DOJ attorneys argue in the filing that there is enough ""difference of opinion"" on the legal questions in the lawsuit, including the definition of the Emoluments Clause, that an appeals court should review Judge Emmet Sullivan's rulings before the case advances.

And the Justice Department, which is representing the president in the lawsuit filed by more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” of the case mean that a higher court should review its merits even before the lawsuit advances in district court.

“[D]espite the 150-year unbroken history of federal courts refraining from enjoining a sitting President in the performance of his official duties, this Court determined that it has the power to do so,” the filing reads.

The lawyers also argued that an appeals court could either significantly narrow the scope of the lawsuit, or rule that the Democratic members of Congress behind the complaint don’t have standing to sue and shutter the case altogether.

And they claim that Sullivan’s ruling on the lawsuit last month “broadly interpreted the Foreign Emoluments Clause in a manner that calls into doubt the constitutionality of conduct of public officials — from President George Washington to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaDOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump Fewer graduates are choosing government jobs GOP pollster: Trump's low approval ratings won't stop him from being re-elected MORE — that has been accepted throughout history.""

The DOJ lawyers also requested that Sullivan, a Clinton appointee, temporarily halt proceedings in the lawsuit while he considers their motion and continue that stay if a higher court does take up their appeal.

""This case presents the unprecedented circumstance of impending civil discovery against the sitting President of the United States concerning his compliance with a constitutional provision in his official capacity. Any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President’s performance of his constitutional duties,"" the filing reads.

If the judge grants the motion, the D.C. Circuit will likely take up the appeal.

The Democratic members of Congress behind the lawsuit argue that Trump is in violation of the Emoluments Clause when he profits from foreign governments without congressional approval.

They have pointed to Trump’s global businesses, and their continuing operations while he is in office, as evidence that he is violating the clause.

The Justice Department has argued that Trump cannot violate the clause with any commercial profits, but only if he receives gifts or directly profits from an action he takes as president on behalf of foreign officials. DOJ is representing Trump in the case because he is being sued in his official capacity as president and not as an individual.

Trump is also facing a lawsuit from D.C. and Maryland alleging that he violated the Emoluments Clause."
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out,https://www.politico.com,['Ian Kullgren'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/labor-chief-of-staff-forced-out-1321669,"Nick Geale, chief of staff for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (shown), reportedly alienated not only Labor officials but also ""people at the White House."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images employment Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff will be forced out by the end of this month after an investigation by the White House raised questions about his professional conduct.

A DOL spokesperson confirmed Nick Geale‘s departure Tuesday but did not provide further details.

Story Continued Below

White House officials instructed Acosta to fire Geale after its review concluded that Geale's interactions with employees were damaging DOL morale, according to two former Trump administration officials with direct knowledge of the investigation.

According to the former officials, Geale created a culture of fear inside DOL’s headquarters with profanity-laced tirades and belittlement of subordinates.

“There are times when he goes completely loony,” said one of the former Trump officials, recalling Geale pounding the table and screaming during a meeting.

Geale, in a written statement, called the DOL staff “dedicated and professional,"" and said he was “very excited to spend time with my new family and take on the next challenges of our journey.”

One of the former Trump officials recalled a particularly fraught encounter in which Geale became furious about what he perceived as poor preparation for a meeting.

“Nick came into my office screaming and yelling and throwing papers on my desk,” the former official said. “I chose to leave [DOL] because I didn’t get any work done.“

“He’s abusive, he’s abrasive, he tries to be intimidating, he’s condescending,” the former official added. After this person complained to Acosta about Geale's rages, nothing changed. “He ratified Nick’s behavior,” the former official said. “He was privy to it.“

Bloomberg Law reported that in April 2018 Geale sent out a memo ordering the agency's top political appointees to ""physically remain in the Frances Perkins [Building] on the day before a hearing until all hearing preparation is completed.... No agency head is allowed to be out of town or otherwise even leave the building on the day before the Secretary testifies without affirmative permission from either Molly [Conway, deputy chief of staff] or me.”

A third person with knowledge of the situation said Geale alienated not only DOL officials but also ""people at the White House."" Some White House officials also expressed frustration to POLITICO with the slow pace of deregulation at DOL, and blamed that at least in part on Geale.

Acosta’s own proclivity for caution continues to bother Republican allies who expected a more forceful advocate for business. For instance, DOL has struggled for months to finalize a rule that would privatize some of the agency's apprenticeship training, as it was instructed to do by a 2017 order from President Donald Trump. Enthusiasm for the initiative is tepid inside DOL.

“Very few people, if any, in the building think that this will work,” another DOL official said.

News of the dismissal was first reported by Axios.

Geale‘s forced departure is more bad news for Acosta, who has spent the last few months fending off criticism of a 2008 plea deal he reached with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida. A federal judge in February ruled that the Justice Department’s failure to notify Epstein's victims of the plea deal before it was finalized violated the 2004 Crime Victims' Rights Act.

""In many positions at the Department of Labor, on Capitol Hill, and as a member of the National Mediation Board, Nicholas Geale is a national expert on labor issues,” Acosta said in a statement. “After years of hard work here at the Department, I wish him the best on his future endeavors.”

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., claimed that an “insurance policy” mentioned in an August 2016 text between disgraced former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page referred to their ability to obtain a FISA warrant.

""We believe that 'insurance policy' is not just about investigating the Trump campaign,"" said Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, during an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Tuesday night. “We believe it's to ensure that they were able to get the FISA warrant on Carter Page so they could go in and look at the emails in the campaign.”

NUNES CASTS DOUBT ON MUELLER’S FINDINGS ABOUT PAPADOPOULOS TIPSTER'S MOSCOW LINKS

Page, a former campaign adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, was the subject of the FISA warrant that allowed investigators to surveil him.

President Trump and Republicans say that the warrant shows the corruption of the FBI and the Department of Justice under President Obama, with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein signing off on the warrant, and that the surveillance was illegal as it was using unverified information to justify spying on a U.S. citizen.

Portions of the FISA application have been released to the public and show that the infamous and unverified Steele Dossier was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant. The dossier, which was opposition research funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign, contains salacious allegations against Trump. It was also a major component used to justify subsequent renewals.

Nunes told host Sean Hannity that the FBI was aware of the issues surrounding the accuracy of the dossier and even knew the dossier was actually just research for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

“These really were the perverted fantasies of [Fusion GPS Founder] Glenn Simpson working with the Clinton campaign to say 'What can we draw up here that we can spread out lies to the American people, that we can feed into the FBI and – lo and behold – let’s get an investigation going into the Trump campaign.’ That’s really what happened here,” Nunes said.

"FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says",https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/fda-death-penalty-drugs-1323248,"“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. | California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via Getty Images legal FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says

The Justice Department issued a legal opinion that could lead to more executions in the U.S. by easing the availability of drugs used to carry out lethal injections.

The opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel says the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate drugs or other items when used in connection with the death penalty.

Story Continued Below

The immediate effect of the Trump administration decision is unclear because of a court injunction issued in 2012 barring the FDA from allowing the importation of a key execution drug, sodium thiopental. Shortages of that drug have led many states to scale back or halt executions in recent years.

In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency would “follow the conclusion of the opinion to the extent permissible” by the 7-year-old order, which remains in effect.

The 26-page opinion , signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, indicates that it was sought by the attorney general's office, but does not say when. OLC opinions are traditionally treated as controlling law within the executive branch. Courts often take note of such high-level legal advice when it is made public, but are not obliged to follow the opinions.

Engel’s opinion argues that drugs and other items intended for use in executions are not covered by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, passed in 1938 and repeatedly updated by Congress. The legal memo also says that conclusion is reinforced by so-called federalism problems that could arise from federal officials trying to enforce such regulations in a way that would frustrate state efforts to carry out executions.

“The FDCA cannot be read as authorizing FDA to effectively ban capital punishment, because that reading would contravene or render moot a host of federal statutes that presuppose the lawfulness of capital punishment,” Engel wrote in the opinion, dated May 3 and released by the Justice Department on Tuesday evening.

“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. “Interpreting the FDCA to bar the importation, sale, and distribution of articles intended for use in executions would conflict with that settled understanding. The FDCA’s definitions of ‘drug’ and ‘device’ are broad, but breadth alone fails to manifest the intent needed to alter federal-state relations so dramatically with respect to capital punishment.”

While the 2012 injunction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit the next year, Engel’s opinion downplays the significance of those rulings. “Neither the district court, nor the D.C. Circuit, addressed the broader question of FDA’s jurisdiction,” the opinion says.

When the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental stopped production in 2009, states began scrambling to find stocks of the drug in the U.S. and abroad. After the 2012 injunction, the FDA moved to halt such imports. In 2015, it blocked a shipment headed for a Texas prison.

Because of the shortage, states have turned to a variety of other methods for executions, including substitutions for thiopental in a three-drug combination and the use of a single drug, pentobarbital. Some of the new methods resulted in a spate of episodes in which the condemned gasped, convulsed or cried out during the execution process.

States have carried out about 25 executions a year since 2015, a significant drop-off from the previous two decades. The last federal execution was in 2003.

Giuliani weighs in on Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine emerging as 2020 issue for Joe Biden,https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/giuliani-joe-hunter-biden-ukraine-2020,"Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, said on “Hannity” Tuesday that former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s dealings in Ukraine represent “a case that is crying out to be investigated,” adding, “If it doesn't get investigated, we just don't have equal justice in this country.”

Giuliani said last week he would travel to Ukraine's capital city, Kiev, to urge the government to investigate the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's recently concluded probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the involvement of Hunter Biden in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.

Last Friday, Giuliani said the trip was off because he believed he would be “walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president.”

“Biden's son took millions of dollars out of the Ukraine and over a billion dollars out of China while Joe Biden is vice president, was really directing the relief for Ukraine, the loan guarantees, well over a billion dollars of loan guarantees,” Giuliani said.

“His son then got under investigation for good reason. He was working for the most corrupt company in Ukraine, he was working for a Ukrainian oligarch who was being protected by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, the same Putin we that have been hearing about all this time. Imagine that.”

Giuliani went on to say, “Putin's friend was paying Joe's son 3, 4, 5, possibly more millions of dollars and he got under investigation, and Joe bragged two years later that he got the prosecutor general fired. He just left out of it that the prosecutor general was investigating his son and his son's crooked boss, and then afterwards, the case disappeared.”

BIDEN CALLS GIULIANI'S NOW-CANCELED UKRAINE TRIP 'INAPPROPRIATE'

On Monday, the former vice president criticized Giuliani for threatening to travel to Ukraine. “I can’t remember any lawyer representing the president, conferring with the president, deciding to go overseas where a government... relies on U.S. largesse and try to get them to do something that everybody knows never happened,” Biden said during a stop in New Hampshire.

He emphasized that “all of the reporting indicated that there’s not a single solitary thing that is inappropriate” about his son’s Ukraine connections.

“I set up this meeting a week earlier, two days before I get a call that it's been leaked to The New York Times that two people around him, around the new president-elect, were people that were enemies of Donald Trump and one of them has been convicted of it,” Giuliani said.

He added, “Biden is going to be investigated no matter what. You can't escape those facts no matter how much the media tries to suppress it because there isn’t equal treatment with them, but I want to make sure they don't suppress the investigation of all of this information and all of this dirt that they were digging up that goes back at least as early as January of 2016 with the meeting in Obama's White House.”

Giuliani’s planned and then abandoned trip drew sharp outrage from Democrats who said it was an overt attempt to recruit foreign help to influence a U.S. election. Biden – the clear front-runner among 2020 Democrats – has been seen as Trump’s biggest threat in the president’s re-election campaign.

When asked if he will go to Ukraine later on, Giuliani answered, “I'll go there as soon as I feel that I can have a useful conversation and this president is not surrounded by enemies of Donald Trump, convicted enemies of Donald Trump.”

Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'John Bresnahan', 'Brian Faler', 'Aaron Lorenzo']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/trump-subpoena-congress-legal-1318867,"The ruling from Judge Amit Mehta (left) will represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress. | Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Legal Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case Democrats are fighting for access to the president's financial records.

A federal judge raised pointed doubts Tuesday about arguments by President Donald Trump’s legal team that a Democratic effort to subpoena Trump’s financial records was an invalid exercise of congressional power.

Amit Mehta, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, indicated that he would have trouble ruling that Congress’ goal in accessing the president’s records was unconstitutional — as Trump’s lawyers have argued — and he underscored that he believes Congress has a significant “informing function” that doesn’t necessarily require an explicit legislative purpose to justify an investigation involving the president.

Story Continued Below

“Does Congress have to do that — do they have to identify a bill in advance? The Supreme Court has said the opposite,” Mehta said during a round of questioning with Trump’s attorney William Consovoy during a hearing.

Consovoy argued throughout Tuesday’s hearing that Congress has no basis for investigating whether Trump’s financial disclosures are accurate, contending that it’s a “law enforcement issue” that’s not tied to a specific legislative agenda.

Mehta cast serious doubt on those claims, suggesting at one point that investigations of such financial violations are “strictly” under Congress' purview and that the courts have “very little, if any” discretion over Congress’ asks.

“I almost wonder whether I have no role,” Mehta told Consovoy at one point.

Despite Mehta’s apparent skepticism of the Trump team’s legal arguments, the appointee of President Barack Obama declined to issue a ruling from the bench but said he would mull over the arguments in the coming days, calling the nature of the dispute too significant to decide quickly. He gave both sides until the end of the week to submit additional filings and evidence.

If Mehta ultimately rules that the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s subpoena — seeking eight years of Trump’s financial records from the accounting firm Mazars USA — is valid, it would mark a significant victory for House Democrats mounting a slew of inquiries about the president’s financial dealings, each of which have been challenged by Trump. The committee’s demand is part of its investigation into financial crimes allegedly committed by Trump, including whether he inaccurately reported his finances.

It also would reinforce a ruling made in 2017 in support of House Republican efforts to obtain private records from Fusion GPS — the firm commissioned by the Democratic Party to conduct opposition research on Trump in 2016.

House General Counsel Douglas Letter, arguing on behalf of the oversight panel, urged Mehta to make a timely ruling on the matter.

“This Congress is limited in time. There’s obviously going to be appeals here. We just do not want there to be any lag in time,” Letter said. “We rushed and we briefed this case. We think it should be decided quickly. … Any delay here undermines the House’s ability to do what the Constitution allows it to do.”

Letter knocked the president in his opening remarks to the judge, contending that the president “has taken the position” that Congress is a “nuisance.”

“The problem with that is this is a total and basic and fundamental misunderstanding of the system that was set up by the Constitution,” Letter said.

Trump filed suit seeking to invalidate the committee’s subpoena three weeks ago — the first of two lawsuits aimed at hobbling House Democrats’ investigations targeting his administration, presidential campaign and business empire.

Mehta’s ruling could provide a blueprint for other judges deciding on Trump’s attempts to thwart congressional investigations. Trump has also filed a lawsuit to block the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees from subpoenaing Deutsche Bank and Capital One, where many of his business and personal financial records are housed.

The judge’s ruling will also represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress — marking the first time the judiciary weighs in on Trump’s blanket strategy of refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas and oversight requests from House Democrats.

Mehta spent the early portion of the hearing grilling Consovoy about why Congress' interest in investigating possible foreign payments to the president — known as emoluments — isn't valid and whether Congress has legitimate investigative interest into a president's potential financial conflicts of interest.

“Say for example if a president had a financial interest in a particular piece of legislation that was being considered … in your view Congress could not investigate whether a president has a conflict of interest?” Mehta wondered.

“It would lack legitimate legislative purpose,” replied Consovoy, who argued that any attempt by Congress to determine whether a president was acting outside the law was improper because it's the job of law enforcement, not lawmakers.

Mehta questioned, however, whether the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons or the Watergate investigation of President Richard Nixon would have passed muster under Trump's current legal theory.

Trump's attorney said he was arguing only on the facts of the subpoena case, not previous investigations.

Consovoy urged Mehta to grant Trumps’ legal team “a week or two” to gather documents from the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, that might support their case. Consovoy said he’s particularly interested in obtaining a memorandum of understanding between the Oversight Committee and the Intelligence and Financial Services panels, which he said could support the argument that Democrats are pursuing Trump from a law enforcement — not legislative — perspective.

Consovoy acknowledged that he'd have no authority to compel production of that document from committee Democrats, including Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), but he said Jordan might be willing to provide it voluntarily. Letter told Mehta that the memorandum of understanding has “nothing to do” with the Mazars subpoena but offered to provide it to the court under seal.

Letter said the House’s investigations have been supported by a previous Supreme Court ruling determining that such probes only need to have a conceivable legislative purpose, not necessarily an explicit one.

Mehta asked Letter whether he agreed with the notion that Congress’ legislative role also includes an “informing function” — providing important information to the public. Letter noted that Congress investigated the 9/11 attacks and issues related to the Iraq War, Watergate and Whitewater — primarily to inform the public.

Letter also noted that it’s sometimes impossible to know what legislative remedy might arise from an investigation at the outset. “I’m not a prophet,” he said, “you’re not a prophet.”

When Mehta questioned whether there are any conceivable limits on Congress’ demands for private presidential documents, Letter replied that it’s conceivable but that this case isn’t close.

“I want to see the president’s diary from when he was 7 years old or she was 12 years old — that would probably stretch my arguments to the breaking point,” he said.

Cummings issued the so-called friendly subpoena earlier this year to Mazars, which asked for the subpoena so that it could comply with the request. He issued it just days after Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and fixer, provided documents to the Oversight panel purportedly showing that the president artificially inflated and deflated the value of his assets in order to benefit financially.

Cohen in February disclosed several of Trump’s financial statements which were submitted to Deutsche Bank in 2014 as Trump was seeking a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills NFL team. Cohen told lawmakers that the documents showed that Trump inflated the value of certain assets to secure the loan.

The committee says it needs Trump’s financial records from Mazars as part of its efforts to corroborate Cohen’s allegations.

During the hearing, Mehta also asked pointed questions of the House Democratic side. Mehta noted that Cummings suggested at the outset of his subpoena request that he wanted to “determine whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct” before taking office.

“This is not an impeachment proceeding. What’s the basis to investigate illegal conduct before his tenure in office?” Mehta wondered.

Letter replied hypothetically that there could be significant questions about whether Trump was under the thumb of a foreign power.

“President Trump has conceded, I believe, that he was trying to get a hotel in Moscow. Had he not been elected he would have pursued that,” he said, noting that the president may have taken questionable steps to secure that hotel.

“It may very well be that the Russians know that. It may very well be that the Russian oligarchs know that. We need to know that … Is the president of the United States beholden to foreign interests who can hold certain things over his head?” Letter continued.

""The only question in my mind is, is it Nick Geale that's the problem? Or is he just doing his boss's bidding? It's not clear to me that Nick is the only problem. You take your cues from the top.""

Geale has reportedly told Acosta he will leave the department shortly.

A Labor Department spokesperson defended the department’s record on deregulation to Axios.

""The U.S. Department of Labor had $3.28 billion in deregulatory savings in FY 2018 — the second most in the administration,"" the spokesperson said. ""Even more actions like the current rules-making on overtime, joint employer and regular rate are in process. Nick Geale plays an important role in these efforts.""

Acosta himself has recently been under fire amid questions from his time as a federal prosecutor about his role in securing a deal for financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare,https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/democrats-doj-obamacare-1318932,"Attorney General William Barr's decision to stop defending the constitutionality of Obamacare has lead to heightened scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Health care Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare

House Democrats are mounting yet another confrontation with the Justice Department that could lead to subpoenas, but this time it's not about special counsel Robert Mueller's report — it's about health care.

Five committee chairmen foreshadowed a possible subpoena as soon as May 24 if Attorney General William Barr declines to provide documents related to his decision to stop defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act — the health care law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Story Continued Below

In letters to Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the chairmen wrote they've been asking since April 8 for documents connected to the decision, as well as testimony from four key officials involved in the effort. The request, they said, sought a response by April 22 but that the reply fell short. Now, they've given the Justice Department two more weeks to meet the committees' demands. They've also asked the White House to make budget director Russ Vought available for an interview.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The letters are signed by Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

Nadler's committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report to Congress as well as Mueller's underlying evidence. But the full House has yet to consider the committee's effort. Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week that other committees may want to combine similar contempt proceedings into one overarching floor vote that could come in the next few weeks.

Democrats are also locked in confrontations with the Trump administration over accessing Trump's tax returns — a request made by Neal's Ways and Means Committee. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded access to Mueller's report, as well, on national security grounds and has issued a subpoena for his files last week.

The new effort on health care could become part of Democrats' broader strategy if they continue to accuse the Justice Department of stonewalling by the time the new deadline arrives on May 24. But persuading other lawmakers to wait until June — after a weeklong Memorial Day recess — for a comprehensive contempt vote could be difficult. Rank-and-file Democrats have been clamoring for punitive measures against Barr for weeks for his handling of Mueller's report.

Democratic leaders believe that picking a fight on health care is better politics than other demands are — and the skirmish shows their efforts to confront the Trump administration have policy dimensions and aren't just Trump-focused investigations.

Democrats have attributed the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the health care law, known as Obamacare, to ""politically motivated forces"" in the White House. The Obama White House took a similar step in 2011 when the Justice Department, at Obama's urging, stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages — a move social conservatives denounced at the time.

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: DOJ inspector general FISA probe will find 'mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-doj-inspector-general-will-find-mistakes-in-fisa-probe,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Monday he expects the Justice Department inspector general to find ""mistakes"" committed by the bureau in its handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."

The move to evict the protesters from the embassy came after a group of US anti-war activists began moving into the embassy last month

Medea Benjamin, one of the founders of the anti-war group Code Pink, previously told CNN that diplomats from the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had given them access to the embassy before the diplomats left as the standoff unfolded between Maduro and Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido.

Venezuela's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for North America Carlos Ron denounced the removal of protestors on Monday

""The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not authorized the entry of police officers into the former Embassy building in Washington, DC.

Comey’s turn as an above-it-all martyr draws intense criticism from former deputy AG,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/james-comeys-turn-as-an-above-it-all-martyr-draws-intense-criticism-from-former-deputy-attorney-general,"Don't look now, but former deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former FBI Director James Comey are in a shouting war.

If I were to pick a side, it would be Rosenstein's. He is not the aggressor. He is also not wrong.

At a gathering of the Greater Baltimore Committee Monday evening, the former deputy attorney general, at last unburdened by office, fired back at the White House critic, claiming the fired FBI chief is a hack posturing as an above-it-all martyr to score lucrative gigs on the anti-Trump resistance circuit.

""[T]he former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul,"" said Rosenstein, who announced his resignation in April as deputy attorney general. ""That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally, we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony.""

His remarks are in reference specifically to a New York Times op-ed Comey authored titled, “How Trump Co-opts Leaders Like Bill Barr.” The former FBI director writes that “proximity to an amoral leader reveals something depressing. I think that’s at least part of what we’ve seen with Bill Barr and Rod Rosenstein.”

Comey adds, “Accomplished people lacking inner strength can’t resist the compromises necessary to survive Mr. Trump and that adds up to something they will never recover from. It takes character like Mr. Mattis’s to avoid the damage, because Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.”

This sort of thing is par for the course for Comey. Since he was sacked from the FBI in 2017, he has refashioned himself as a supposedly principles-driven anti-Trump critic. Never mind that whereas the Left was burning Comey in effigy 2016 for making Trump president, he has suddenly gained widespread acceptance and friendship by taking this path. Also, never mind that Comey’s constant running of his mouth has also landed him well-paying speaking gigs and a memoir book deal that netted him more than $2 million.

I would rather a former Justice Department bigwig not spar publicly with the former head of the FBI. But I also do not fault Rosenstein. This has been a long time coming for Comey, whose sniping from the sidelines has made it harder for people like Rosenstein to do their jobs.

[Read: James Comey reacts to Rod Rosenstein calling him a 'partisan pundit': 'I wish him the best']

On Monday, Rosenstein said he ""did not dislike"" Comey in the past. In fact, he added, he “admired” him! But that started to change around the time Comey announced there would be no charges brought against Hillary Clinton for maintaining an unauthorized homebrew email server when she was secretary of state, Rosenstein said, characterizing the ex-FBI chief’s handling of the investigation as a career-defining mistake.

""The clearest mistake was the director’s decision to hold a press conference about an open case, reveal his recommendation, and discuss details about the investigation without the consent of the prosecutors and the attorney general,"" Rosenstein told the Greater Baltimore Committee. ""Then, he chose to send a letter to the Congress on the eve of the election stating that one of the candidates was under criminal investigation, expecting it to be released immediately to the public.""

It is worth noting here that the FBI was instructed explicitly by former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s Justice Department not to charge Clinton with ""gross negligence,” which was the FBI’s chief charge, according to congressional testimony provided by a former bureau attorney. Obviously that reflects poorly on the Obama administration, but it also implies new levels of snake-like behavior on Comey's part. Was he attempting to go over Lynch's head in a passive-aggressive fashion when he gave his infamous presser, clearly demonstrating Clinton's guilt and then abruptly changing gears to announce she would not be prosecuted?

Rosenstein continued Monday, saying, ""My soul and character are pretty much the same today as they were two years ago. I took a few hits and made some enemies during my time in the arena, but I held my ground and made a lot of friends. And thanks to them, I think I made the right calls on the things that mattered.”

It is not ideal for the country to see such a public spat between former heads of agencies that trade on trust and credibility. But Rosenstein has a right to respond — and show me the lie in what he said."

Columnist

Reading George Packer’s sprawling, mesmerizing biography “Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,” I felt a shock of recognition. Not just because I knew Holbrooke and could so readily recognize him in Packer’s novelistic portrait. I realized that Holbrooke could be egomaniacal, but, like Packer, I liked and respected him anyway. He was charming company and a supportive mentor, at least when you were no threat to him — and I wasn’t.

But there’s another reason I felt a pang of familiarity while devouring “Our Man”: Packer’s description of Holbrooke reminded me of the protagonist of my book “The Road Not Taken: Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam.” Lansdale was a legendary covert operative who, while working for the CIA, masterminded the defeat of the Hukbalahap rebellion, a communist insurgency in the Philippines, in the early 1950s, and then moved to Saigon, where in 1954 he helped create the state of South Vietnam.

There were, to be sure, many differences between them. Lansdale was never as ambitious or egotistical as Holbrooke, who once told a girlfriend, “I’m going to be the next Henry Kissinger.” (“That was the end of her fling with Holbrooke,” Packer writes.) Nor was he a social climber like Holbrooke, who cultivated powerful older men such as W. Averell Harriman and romanced successful women such as TV journalist Diane Sawyer. Lansdale’s ambition was to advance the cause of democracy in Asia, not himself. He even hesitated to accept an offer from President John F. Kennedy to become the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Holbrooke, by contrast, was incessantly scheming for self-advancement. The only jobs he refused were the ones he judged beneath his exalted status. Holbrooke’s epic womanizing also put Lansdale to shame. Lansdale had only one mistress — Pat Kelly, the great love of his life — and he eventually married her after the death of his first wife.

But despite the many differences, I detected a strong resemblance between Holbrooke and Lansdale. Both were unconventional, strong-willed, occasionally ruthless characters. Both were animated by a powerful, perhaps excessive, faith in the United States as a force for good. Both played by their own rules. And both could not hide their disdain for deskbound, risk-averse bureaucrats.

The similarities were not coincidental. Holbrooke’s first job as a tyro diplomat in 1963 was working in Saigon for the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Rural Affairs. Its head was Rufus Phillips, a courtly Virginian, late of Yale University and the CIA, who was a protege of Lansdale’s. He taught the young Holbrooke the tenets of “Lansdalism”: To win a war among the people, you had to win over the people rather than blow them to smithereens. This was a simple yet powerful insight, later labeled “population-centric counterinsurgency,” that Holbrooke imbibed long before it became fashionable.

Phillips also reflected Lansdale’s informal and idealistic approach. Rural Affairs was a “shirtsleeves” outfit where no one stood on protocol and everyone was encouraged to get close to the Vietnamese people. Before long, Holbrooke was a provincial representative far from the comforts of Saigon. Decades later, when Holbrooke was appointed special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Packer writes, he modeled his office on Rural Affairs — “the freedom and openness, the hostility to bureaucratic convention, the sense of excitement and risk.”

That Holbrooke ended his career working for the secretary of state, rather than being secretary of state himself, was a source of endless frustration to him. So, too, was the fact that his advice was constantly ignored. Lansdale suffered a similar, agonizing fate: He was sidelined from Vietnam policy in the Kennedy administration as the United States was drawing closer to a quagmire that he saw more clearly than most. When Lansdale went back to Vietnam in 1965 to work on winning “hearts and minds,” he was as ineffectual as Holbrooke proved to be on Afghanistan policy in 2009-2010.

Both Holbrooke and Lansdale blamed others for their downfall, but ultimately both sabotaged themselves through a lack of self-awareness. While interviewing for a job in the Obama administration, Holbrooke corrected President-elect Barack Obama when Obama referred to him as “Dick.” “Would you do me a favor, Mr. President?” Holbrooke said. “It’s important to my wife that you call me ‘Richard.'” Little wonder Obama had an instant aversion to him. Lansdale was similarly clueless in his dealings with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. He would lecture on how to fight the Viet Cong while failing to notice the secretary’s eyes glaze over. “He was turning McNamara off,” a subordinate told me, “but waxing more and more enthusiastic, speaking more rapidly.”

The tragedy of Holbrooke’s and Lansdale’s lives is that if they had attained higher office, they might have changed U.S. foreign policy for the better, perhaps avoiding costly mistakes in Vietnam and Afghanistan. They certainly could have done better than many of the inoffensive nonentities who supplanted them. As it was, they achieved a great deal — Lansdale in defeating communism in the Philippines, Holbrooke in negotiating peace in Bosnia. But their maverick ways ultimately caused them to be rejected by the system. Presidents in the future would be well-advised to show greater tolerance for troublemakers and truth tellers.

"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

"For now, talk of war with Iran is just talk",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/for-now-talk-of-war-with-iran-is-just-talk,"POMPEO: ‘OUR AIM IS NOT WAR’: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrives this morning in Sochi, Russia, for talks with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin. The meetings are supposed to cover a wide range of issues, including new arms control agreements and the U.S.-backed effort to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

But with the dispatch of U.S. warships and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf, the Russians are anxious to hear what America plans to do to deescalate tensions with Tehran, with Lavrov saying he looks forward to a “sincere conversation” with his American counterpart.

In an interview before he left for Europe, Pompeo said the increased threats from Iran are real. “It appears to be something that is current; that is, things we’re worried about today,” he told CNBC. But he insisted the United States won’t stumble into war with Iran.

“We're not going to miscalculate. Our aim is not war. Our aim is a change in the behavior of the Iranian leadership. We hope the Iranian people will get what they finally want and what they so richly deserve,” Pompeo said, referring to his oft-repeated 12 demands that Iran begin acting like a “normal” country.

PLAN FOR THE WORST: Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that last week acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a plan that would send up to 120,000 U.S. troops to the region if Iran carries out any attacks on U.S. forces.

The updated military plan was reportedly presented at a meeting of Trump’s top national security aides last Thursday, but it is unclear whether the president himself has seen it.

“The revisions were ordered by hard-liners led by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser,” the Times reported, citing what it said were more than a half-dozen national security officials who were said to have been briefed on the updated plans. “They do not call for a land invasion of Iran, which would require vastly more troops,” according to the report.

TRUMP: ‘THEY WILL SUFFER GREATLY’: As the United States continues to assess whether Iran is responsible for damage to four oil tankers near the Persian Gulf, President Trump issued a vague warning during an exchange with reporters at the White House.

“We'll see what happens with Iran. If they do anything, it would be a very bad mistake, if they do anything,” Trump said. “I'm hearing little stories about Iran. If they do anything, they will suffer greatly. We'll see what happens with Iran.”

While the United States has not publicly blamed Iran for the damage to ships, which Saudi Arabia called “an act of sabotage,” the Wall Street Journal reports that early findings in the ongoing analysis show Iran was likely behind the incident. Two of the ships were Saudi.

Owners of one of the ships, a Norwegian-flagged tanker, said an unknown object caused a small hole in the ship’s hull, while AP said a review of commercial satellite imagery showed a boom around the Emirati oil tanker, indicating the possibility of an oil leak, while the other three showed no major damage visible from above.

IRAN: CARRIER TARGET NOT THREAT: Iran is keeping up the bellicose rhetoric as tensions rise between Washington and Tehran. A senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander is the latest Iranian official to talk about attacking U.S. ships in the Gulf.

“An aircraft carrier that has at least 40 to 50 planes on it and 6,000 forces gathered within it was a serious threat for us in the past but now it is a target and the threats have switched to opportunities,” said Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards’ aerospace division, Reuters reports.

REMEMBER THE TONKIN GULF: Members of Congress complained that while Pompeo was in Brussels briefing skeptical allies on the intelligence behind the undisclosed “credible threats” from Iran, they were once again out of the loop.

“We have not been briefed. To my knowledge, there's not been a significant or serious briefing by the Pentagon or by the intelligence agencies,” Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said on CNN yesterday, adding, “I really do not see military action against, directly against Iran. That would be an extraordinary and a very, very bad situation.”

Garamendi cautioned against the kind of overreaction that drew the United States into the Vietnam War in 1964. “I do not want to have a Tonkin Gulf situation here that could set off a conflict, so let's be very sure that we understand all of the elements, take our time, get the intelligence, and then make a rational, careful decision,” he said. “And you better involve Congress in that decision.”

HAPPENING TODAY: After a months-long drought, the Pentagon will offer a briefing from a senior spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition that is still fighting ISIS even as the group no longer holds territory.

British Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, deputy commander, Strategy and Information, Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve, briefs the press live from Baghdad at 11 a.m. He’s likely to discuss ISIS’ efforts to reestablish itself in the area around Kirkuk in Iraq and the recent air strikes targeting them in the mountains. The briefing will be streamed live at www.defense.gov .

SHANAHAN HAPPY TO BE ON THE TEAM: In an interview that aired yesterday on President Trump’s favorite morning news program, Patrick Shanahan was asked what he would do if, like his predecessor, he found himself in a major conflict with his boss. Disagreement over Syria policy prompted Jim Mattis to resign. Brian Kilmeade of ""Fox and Friends"" asked: What would Shanahan do?

“I've talked with the president about that. What I like about working with the president is he's a CEO. I've worked for CEOs. He's focused on outcomes and results,” Shanahan replied. “Will we always agree on everything? No. Are we focused? Do we have the same interests and the same focus? Yes. My job is to get the results we need to make this country successful, to defend this country.”

Shanahan, who Trump has said he’ll nominate to serve as his second defense secretary, has seemed to have a minor role in shaping policy, compared with Pompeo and Bolton, but he told Kilmeade he’s happy to be a team player.

“Let me say, this is, I think, what differentiates people that come from a corporate environment: It is mandatory that people work together,” he said, “So you can have a difference of opinion. I have disagreements with people. I mean, that's normal. And I bring those opinions to our discussions. At the end of the day, we have to have cohesion. We have to work as a team.”

N. KOREA WANTS ITS SHIP BACK: North Korea calls the U.S. seizure of one of its cargo ships “an unlawful and outrageous act” and demands its immediate return.

“The latest U.S. act constitutes an extension of the American method of calculation for bringing the DPRK to its knees by means of ""maximum pressure"" and an outright denial of the underlying spirit of the June 12 DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement that has committed to establish new bilateral relations,” said an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman .

“The U.S. should ponder over the consequences its heinous act might have on the future developments and immediately return our ship,” the spokesman said.

MARINES NEED A FEW GOOD NERDS: The Marine Corps has announced the creation of what it calls “Cyber Aux,” short for Marine Corps Cyber Auxiliary, described as a volunteer organization aimed at increasing Marine Corps cyberspace readiness.

“The Cyber Aux is comprised of a small cadre of highly-talented cyber experts who train, educate, advise, and mentor Marines to keep pace with constantly-evolving cyber challenges,” said a release from the Marine Corps yesterday. “Qualified volunteers must be US citizens with advanced cyber experience and will be screened and assessed before assignment to a specified unit or project.”

And in recognition that “computer nerds” may not look the part of a Marine, the corps says the citizen volunteers will not wear a uniform or need to meet the Marine Corps physical fitness and grooming standards.

RUBIO RENEWS REQUEST FOR KERRY PROBE: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote to Attorney General William Barr Monday requesting an investigation be opened into the actions of former secretary of state John Kerry for potential violations of the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

President Trump had complained that Kerry’s talks with the Iranian government violated the 1799 law that bars private citizens from engaging in unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments.

“As you know, former Secretary Kerry’s actions since leaving office have come under scrutiny as they related to the Iran nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” Rubio said in the letter to Barr. “The American people deserve to know that U.S. laws are enforced regardless of any individual’s past position.”

The Logan Act has never been enforced, and as former defense secretary Robert Gates observed on CBS Sunday, “American politicians and former leaders talk to other leaders all the time.”

SEAL FOLLOW UP: Remember the story of the Navy SEAL denied a position with the New York City Fire Department because he was too old at 37? My colleague Diana Stancy Correll reports that Shaun Donovan has gotten job offers from more than a dozen fire departments from across the country.

Donovan served four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and is leaving the military in 2020. He applied to be a firefighter in New York City, scored in the top 1% on his entry exam, and passed a physical exam. But a background investigator told him he wasn’t eligible for the position because he was 6 months and 25 days too old to qualify.

Donovan is still fighting that decision, but if his appeal fails, he now has more than a few other options.

US attorney's 'apolitical' reputation on the line in probe review,https://www.channel3000.com,['Marshall Cohen'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/national-politics/us-attorneys-apolitical-reputation-on-the-line-in-probe-review/1078015232,"US Attorney's Office via CNN Federal prosecutor John Durham, known for bringing independent rigor to challenging and politically sensitive cases, just got his latest high-profile assignment.

US Attorney's Office via CNN Federal prosecutor John Durham, known for bringing independent rigor to challenging and politically sensitive cases, just got his latest high-profile assignment.

Federal prosecutor John Durham, known for bringing independent rigor to challenging and politically sensitive cases, just got his latest high-profile assignment.

Durham will help Attorney General William Barr review the origins of the Russia investigation, a task that could catapult the press-shy career prosecutor into the national spotlight. Durham is the US attorney in Connecticut and was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017.

His role in Barr's controversial review has earned bipartisan praise. Trump's staunchest allies heralded the addition of a battle-tested investigator to Barr's efforts, while some prominent Democrats say they are confident Durham will honestly follow the facts and get to the truth.

CNN reported Monday that Durham has already been working on the internal review for weeks, according to a source familiar with the matter. Barr's team is getting assistance from the FBI and CIA, but the review hasn't reached the level of a criminal investigation.

In the past week, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and former top FBI lawyer James Baker all publicly defended the decision to open the Russia probe in 2016, justifying the legitimacy of the probe in separate comments.

Handling the most challenging cases

Durham, 69, is a registered Republican, according to public listings, and it doesn't appear that he ever donated to any political candidates, according to Federal Election Commission records. He has been a Justice Department employee under six American presidents, and has worked for the government -- both state and federal -- ever since he became a lawyer in 1975.

During his 37-year career at the Justice Department, Durham worked his way up the ranks and has handed some of the most sensitive investigations in recent memory. He was entrusted with such high-profile responsibilities in both Democratic and Republican administrations.

In 1999, then-Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Durham to investigate corruption by law enforcement in Boston. His investigation looked at how the FBI used informants to infiltrate organized crime, and he successfully prosecuted an FBI supervisor and a police lieutenant.

During the George W. Bush administration, then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey selected Durham to investigate the CIA for destroying videotapes of interrogations that included torture techniques. The investigation stretched into the Obama administration when then-Attorney General Eric Holder expanded Durham's mandate. Durham closed the probe without bringing any charges.

""He's been tasked with sensitive, significant and complex investigations on a number of occasions, during Democratic and Republican administrations,"" said former US attorney Deirdre Daly, who preceded Durham and was appointed by President Barack Obama. ""That should give the public confidence that he'll approach this in a fair, balanced and appropriate way.""

""John is tireless, fair and aggressive,"" Daly, who overlapped with Durham for seven years in the US attorney's office, added.

A spokesman for the US attorney's office declined to comment for this article.

In addition to his work as a special prosecutor, Durham has extensive experience as a trial lawyer. He went after gangs in New Haven, prosecuted mob figures, and secured a guilty plea from former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who admitted to corruption.

He graduated from the University of Connecticut School of Law and received his undergraduate degree from Colgate University. He graduated with honors, according to his official biography.

His first job was with VISTA, now known as AmeriCorps, where he worked as a lawyer in Montana and provided legal services to the Crow Indian Tribe and its members. His work there largely focused on issues regarding land use and natural resources, he told lawmakers.

Durham later returned to Connecticut and became an assistant state's attorney. He joined the Justice Department in 1982, launching a nearly four-decade federal career. Last year, the Senate unanimously confirmed him to become the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut.

A fierce prosecutor who shuns the spotlight

It's difficult to find pictures of Durham on the internet. One image that has widely circulated this week, of Durham standing in front of the New Haven courthouse, is 13 years old.

News conferences and public interviews have been rare for Durham during his career. In a written questionnaire as part of his Senate confirmation process, Durham said he didn't have records of any interviews with newspapers, magazines, radio stations or television networks.

""I would be very surprised if there were any leaks from John or anyone on his team,"" Daly said. ""I think he will do his work quietly and efficiently, but outside of the public eye.""

A Boston Globe article from January 2008 noted that Durham was known for his ""tenacity"" as a prosecutor in tough cases. But the article also said Durham was famous in New England legal circles ""for his avoidance of the media"" and that he ""seldom comments publicly on cases.""

But the newspaper did unearth one quote from a news conference: ""Nobody in this country is above the law, an FBI agent or otherwise, and ultimately the ends do not justify the means.""

The quote -- one that could reverberate with his new assignment -- came on the day Durham secured the conviction of an FBI supervisor on racketeering and obstruction charges that stemmed from his years-long investigation into FBI corruption in the Boston mob scene.

Bipartisan praise for his 'independent' streak

Trump, who has publicly called for the Justice Department to ""investigate the investigators"" ever since special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his Russia probe, has praised Barr's expansion of the review.

""I think it's a great thing that he did it,"" Trump said of Barr's decision to get Durham involved in the internal review. ""I am so proud of our attorney general that he's looking into it.""

Rep. Mark Meadows, the Republican chairman of the hardline Freedom Caucus, tweeted that Durham was an ""outstanding choice"" and said it demonstrated the ""tenacity"" or Barr's probe. Meadows is a critic of the Russia investigation and threatened to support impeachment for Justice Department officials who didn't provide documents about the start of the investigation.

Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with FBI informants in 2016 are part of Barr's review, also heralded the move. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts, though he now says the entire probe was a set-up.

""It's about time that the origins are investigated,"" Papadopoulos told CNN on Tuesday. ""I am certain that my version of events will end up being the correct ones for the history books. I have full faith in the new team assembled and look forward to assisting them if required.""

But some Democrats also are cautiously optimistic about Durham.

Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN that Durham has a reputation for being ""apolitical and fair,"" and noted that he backed Trump's decision to pick Durham as US attorney.

""He's been a prosecutor in Connecticut forever,"" Murphy said of Durham, who has been a public official in the state since 1977. ""He's a law-and-order guy, tough-nosed, well-respected. If I were him, I wouldn't have taken this job, but he's got a reputation of being apolitical and serious.""

Still, Murphy said Barr's examination of the Russia probe is ""designed to be a political hit-job."" He said he hopes Durham ""is taking it on with a desire to get to the truth and get there quickly.""

Daly, a Democrat, also called Durham ""apolitical,"" adding that ""he's independent and will be fair with his direction.""

VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

That’s exactly what President Trump promised, it’s exactly what Congress voted for, and it’s exactly what VA will deliver to America’s veterans."
Justice Dept reaches settlement with West Virginia over ADA compliance,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/443708-doj-west-virginia-reach-ada-compliance-settlement,"The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it has reached a settlement with the state of West Virginia to ensure that the state complies with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).

Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband said the state agreed to expand its services for children with emotional and behavioral disorders so that they can stay in their communities instead of living in separate facilities, according to a Justice Department (DOJ) statement.

The settlement follows a DOJ investigation into West Virginia's mental health system that ended in 2015. According to the Associated Press, federal authorities told the state that year that it was violating the law by sending children to treatment facilities instead of treating them in their own communities.

The state will be required to identify and screen children with mental disorders, develop and expand in-home and in-community services and terminate the ""unnecessary"" use of residential mental health treatment, according to a DOJ fact sheet.

Dreiband added that the state agreed to expand services including behavioral support services, family support and training services, in-home therapy, children’s mobile crisis response, therapeutic foster care and others to individualize care to each child's needs.

The state is also required to ""eliminate the unnecessary placement of children in residential mental health treatment facilities"" by 2024 and instead only house children in such facilities if a professional says it is the best setting for them.

Dreiband said the ""extensive"" probe into the state's mental health system revealed reasonable cause to believe the state was in violation of the ADA ""by failing to serve children with mental health disabilities qualified to receive State services in the most integrated setting appropriate for their needs.""

The investigation found that many children ""cycled in and out of residential institutions"" instead of receiving in-home or community mental health services, he added.

He appeared optimistic that the state would be able to make changes to improve its mental health services.

""I am convinced that with the level of commitment and dedication shown by the State, it will achieve all of the reforms in the agreement, and more importantly, improve the lives of children with mental health disabilities and their families,"" he said.

The Hill has reached out West Virginia's attorney general's office for comment.

Officials with the state's Department of Health and Human Resources told local TV station WSAZ that over the past few years they have been working to improve mental health resources.

If West Virginia does not comply with the agreement, it could be subject to a lawsuit.

House Democrats reject Trump's proposed 31% EPA budget cut,https://www.cnn.com,['Clare Foran'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/politics/house-democrats-epa-budget-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Democrats are sending a message that they view deep budget cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency as a non-starter, setting down another marker for future spending battles with the White House in the months ahead.

The Democrat-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday released a draft funding bill for Interior, Environment and related agencies for fiscal year 2020 that rejects proposed cuts at EPA outlined in President Donald Trump's most recent budget.

Trump's budget proposa l called for cutting EPA funding by 31% -- bringing it down to $6.1 billion from its fiscal year 2019 level of roughly $8.8 billion. The House funding bill released on Tuesday calls for EPA to be funded at a level of $9.52 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase over both the current level and the President's budget request.

Presidential budgets are largely messaging documents and the House bill is an opening bid in an annual appropriations process that won't be completed for months and will ultimately require House and Senate negotiators to come together to find common ground.

The House bill will be subject to changes as soon as Wednesday when it is taken up for consideration in a subcommittee. The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet released its version of the Interior and Environment funding bill for fiscal year 2020.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr Monday calling for him to investigate former Secretary of State John Kerry for potential violations of the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

President Trump had previously called on Kerry to be investigated after it was revealed that Kerry had been in secret talks with the Iranian government in a bid to salvage the Iran nuclear deal after Trump backed out of it.

“As you know, former Secretary Kerry’s actions since leaving office have come under scrutiny as they related to the Iran nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” Rubio said in the letter to Barr.

“The American people deserve to know that U.S. laws are enforced regardless of any individual’s past position,” he added. “The Department of Justice should therefore make a determination on whether or not former Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s recent actions related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran potentially violate the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act.”

Rubio previously asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Kerry in 2018.

Trump said earlier this month that he would like to see the 75-year-old Kerry investigated. The Logan Act forbids unauthorized people from negotiating with foreign governments.

“What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me. John Kerry, he speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call. That is a violation of the Logan Act. And frankly, he should be prosecuted on that,” Trump said.

Kerry served as secretary of state from 2013 to 2017 under President Barack Obama."

(Reuters) - Police officers escorting President Donald Trump’s motorcade were involved in an accident on Tuesday in Louisiana that injured three people.

The White House said the three motorcycle officers were being treated at a hospital and none was hurt seriously.

Trump's motorcade slowed down as it passed the site of the accident in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and reporters in a press car saw at least two officers on the ground and injured. Trump's armored limousine was unaffected.

The motorcycle escorts stopped to deal with the accident, and some of them returned later to the motorcade.

The accident occurred on Interstate 10 moments before the Trump motorcade crossed a bridge spanning Lake Charles.

Trump continued on to an event at Cameron LNG Export Facility in Hackberry, Louisiana, to promote energy infrastructure and economic growth.

"George Papadopoulos calls on Barr, DOJ inspector general to examine 'marked' $10K from alleged spy",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-papadopoulos-calls-on-barr-doj-inspector-general-to-examine-marked-10k-from-alleged-spy,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos wants federal investigators to look into a $10,000 payment he claims to have received in the summer 2017 from a man he believes was a foreign spy.

The money, he said on Tuesday, might have come from special counsel Robert Mueller's team in an effort to entrap him.

""I actually want Congress, Barr, Horowitz, and Huber to review the bills,"" Papadopoulos said on Fox Business, referring to Attorney General William Barr, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber — all of whom are conducting investigations into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and possible misconduct by federal officials.

As Papadopoulos would tell it, a man gave him the money in a Israel hotel room for some sort of Mediterranean-Middle East political consulting venture they discussed. Beyond his work for the Ben Carson and Trump presidential campaigns, Papadopoulos was also an energy consultant. Papadopoulos said he felt uncomfortable and gave the money to his lawyer in Athens, Greece, but the man would not take the money back.

In July 2017, Papadopoulos flew to Dulles International Airport outside Washington where FBI agents placed him under arrest. He pleaded guilty October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year. He also was fined $9,500 and ordered to do community service. Papadopoulos additionally agreed to cooperate with the Russia investigation conducted by Mueller, who recently wrapped up and found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The FBI launched its original counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016. It was prompted by Australian diplomat Alexander Downer informing the FBI that Papadopoulos told him Russia had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos has said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who told him about the alleged dirt on Clinton, was also working for Western intelligence.

Papadopoulos said on Tuesday that the money is still with his lawyer in Greece. He said he believes the bills are ""marked"" and have a traceable link to the Obama Justice Department, FBI, and even Mueller himself.

""If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn't just me they did it to — it's going to open up a massive can of worms,"" Papadopoulos said. ""I think we need to get to the bottom of exactly not only how did this story start, but why were they entrapping us moving forward.""

Papadopoulos informed federal investigators about the payment. It is mentioned at the bottom of an August memo from Mueller that recommended Papadopoulos serve up to six months in jail for misleading the FBI.

""Based on the defendant’s offense level under the Guidelines, the applicable range for a fine is $500 to $9,500,"" the memo reads. ""The defendant provided information about $10,000 in cash he received from a foreign national whom he believed was likely an intelligence officer of a foreign country (other than Russia). The defendant has stated that he kept that money in a safe pending his sentencing in this case and Counsel for the defendant has consented to the imposition of this fine amount. Forfeiture is not applicable in this case.""

Papadopoulos identified the man he allegedly met and received the $10,000 from as Israeli American businessman Charles Tawil. The individual who introduced Papadopoulos to Tawil was an Israeli political strategist named David Ha’ivri. Ha’ivri told the Daily Caller that he was unaware of a $10,000 payment to Papadopoulos, but Tawil did secure a consulting contract with a petroleum and gas infrastructure company with a retainer of $10,000 a month after talks with Papadopoulos fell apart due to his ""immaturity.""

Ha’ivri said he was unaware the FBI was investigating Papadopoulos when he introduced Tawil to him. “Had we known about them before we would have never reached out to a guy like George,” he said.

Tawil told the Times of Israel that Papadopoulos never asked him to take back the money and “was desperate to work with me.” He also denied being part of some entrapment plot. ""First of all, I support Trump, so why would I entrap a pro-Trump guy?” he said. “I like the fact that Trump is the president. I wanted him to be president. I worked a lot in Africa and I see the damage that Clinton and Obama did to the world. Trump may be eccentric but he is at least straightforward.”"
The Energy 202: EPA finally added West Virginia site plagued by chemical dumping to priority cleanup list,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'May At Am']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/,"THE LIGHTBULB

A local company that once helped the West Virginia town of Minden thrive had for for decades dumped untold amounts of industrial chemicals nearby. Years after that coal-equipment manufacturer shuttered and the rest of the local coal economy fell into decline, those toxic chemicals remained.

Now the federal government is saying it will make cleaning up Minden a priority. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency finally added a site in the tiny town of 250 people to its national priority list for contaminated Superfund sites. The government says it prioritize cleaning up a former manufacturing site for Shaffer Equipment Co. and nearby areas around Arbuckle Creek, where the company used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which had been added to oil used by electrical equipment until 1984.

For years, Minden residents said they were being overlooked by federal authorities, even as many of them were diagnosed with an alarming number of cancers and other health issues. Local activists told The Post's Brady Dennis for a profile he wrote of the community they found about a third of Minden residents have died of or been diagnosed with cancer in recent years.

They suspected the cause was PCBs. Yet testing by state and federal officials was not able to definitively establish that link. Still, residents pressed their case with the Trump administration, which proposed last September to add the Minden site to the Superfund list.

West Virginia politicians praised the move on Monday, which open remediation of the site up to an injection of new federal funding through the Superfund program. “This is such an important day because the great people of Minden have been hurting for too long and they’ve been waiting on this level of help for decades,” Gov. Jim Justice (R) said.

So too did local leaders, such as Ayne Amjad, a doctor who helped research the health problems and spent years trying to raise the profile of the town. “So to get so much national support and to see it come to this is such a great feeling,” she said Monday, adding that activists will turn now to relocation efforts for Minden residents living near the toxic site.

In a sign of how intractable some pollutants are, though, the EPA has already undertaken several rounds of cleanups in Minden since 1984, removing dozens of PCB-laced drums buried underground and hauling away nearly 5,000 tons of soil.

The listing is a small part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to revitalize the nearly 40-year-old Superfund program, designed to clean up more than 1,300 hazardous sites across the country. Compelling companies to pay up for cleanup efforts has proved to be one of the few issues on which the EPA has been willing to side with environmental groups during the Trump administration.

LIVE from Howard University in Washington DC the last #Road2GND tour stop.comment ""debate"" on this livestream to get involved via facebook messenger. Posted by Sunrise Movement on Monday, May 13, 2019

— A Green New Deal rally in Washington: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) headlined a rally Monday at Howard University, continuing to call for a Green New Deal after a recent legislative defeat in the Senate. The event, organized by youth climate activist group Sunrise Movement, was the last stop on the group’s “Road to the Green New Deal tour,” which aimed to tout the proposal, even after it failed in a March vote in the Senate.

Next steps: The Sunrise Movement laid out its plans for the next several months, which include giving 2020 candidates until the end of July to sign a no-fossil-fuel-money pledge and to promise to make the Green New Deal a ""Day 1"" priority in the White House.

No ""middle ground"": Audience members booed several times at mentions of finding a ""middle ground"" on climate change, a reference to a recent Reuters article that describes former vice president Joe Biden's yet-to-be-released position on climate change.

Meanwhile in New Hampshire: Biden tried to hammer home to Democratic voters in the early-primary state that he is serious about climate change. “I said, we have an existential threat, we are in a situation where, if we don’t act quickly, we’re going to basically lose almost everything we have,"" he said, according to The New York Times.

President Trump wrote on Twitter last week that he opposed a House bill that would help a Massachusetts Indian tribe build a casino. (Evan Vucci/AP)

— Why did the president tweet about an obscure House bill? Last week, Trump tweeted to express opposition to House Resolution 312, which would grant a Massachusetts Indian tribe control of 321 acres of land for a casino. He wrote on Twitter it was “unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!” But the tribe’s site is about 18 miles from Rhode Island, where state politicians ""aren’t keen to have a new competitor go up against their two casinos, both of which are run by Twin River Worldwide Holdings, a public company with strong Trump ties,"" The Post’s Marc Fisher reports.

Flashback to 1993: The president has a long history of criticizing casinos built Native Americans as fraudulent. More than two decades ago, Trump the casino owner urged a House committee to assess whether tribe members operating the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were really Native Americans. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump said back then.

— The latest on the impasse over disaster funding: The Senate is looking to vote on a much-anticipated but not-yet-finalized disaster-aid package next week, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hoped to approve a deal ahead of the Memorial Day recess, Politico reports.

McConnell called on lawmakers in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to “identify our common ground and produce an outcome for the American people” on the measure meant to provide aid for communities recovering from natural disasters. “Next week is the week before a big break,” said Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) “I can’t predict what will happen, but I think something is either going to hit the floor dealing with that, or maybe we’ll all come to an agreement.”

Meanwhile: McConnell is looking to use the sweeping disaster aid bill to add protections for hemp farmers, according to a draft provision reviewed by The Post. “Now, with a $17 billion disaster bill stalled on Capitol Hill amid a series of political skirmishes, McConnell is trying to add language to the legislation to ensure hemp will be eligible for federal crop insurance,” The Post’s Erica Werner reports. “It was not immediately clear what impact McConnell’s hemp language might have on larger negotiations over the bill, which have been hung up for months in a fight between congressional Democrats and President Trump over aid to Puerto Rico.”

— “Watergate this was not”: When he looked to get in touch with the state’s ornithologist regarding a story about birds, the Boston Globe’s David Abel writes he wasn’t granted access to Andrew Vitz, who works for the state’s Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Instead, he was sent a bulleted list of background responses, only one of which answered a question he had asked.

Abel described a back-and-forth between himself and a press secretary at the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who he said he doesn't blame for the stone-walling. “It’s the policy from her bosses that’s the problem. They have made it clear that they won’t allow me, or many of my colleagues, to speak directly with the experts in government who can often best answer our questions — even when it’s a story about birds,"" he writes of a problem that has become ""not unusual"" since Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) was elected.

— Here’s what you can do now to save species: Save water, buy fewer products encased in plastic, revamp your front lawn.

These are a few things experts say Americans can do each day as a first step to helping save the plant and animal species facing extinction, according to The Post’s Darryl Fears. For example, grass yards, which use up 9 billion gallons of water per day, are the largest irrigated crop in the country. Collin O’Mara, president and chief executive of the National Wildlife Foundation, called lawns “basically biodiversity wastelands” and recommends making space for “milkweed and flowers can support numerous species of butterflies and moths. A single ginkgo tree will support numerous species of caterpillars,” Fears writes.

— “We don’t know a planet like this”: There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any point since the evolution of humans, according to data from the Muana Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The concentration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere has surpassed 415 parts per million, according to a Friday reading. “CO2 levels millions of years ago were higher than 2019 levels, but Earth's temperatures were also much higher,” USA Today reports. “In the 800,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels didn't surpass 300 ppm.”

The reaction from meteorologist Eric Holthaus:

This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has had more than 415ppm CO2.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday unveiled a probe of the Trump administration’s moves to curtail the federal government’s role in scrutinizing police shootings.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Chairman Jerrold Nadler and other committee Democrats requested documents and updates on how the Justice Department has addressed shootings and other cases of excessive police force since President Donald Trump took office in early 2017.

The lawmakers cited statistics, including media reports, that show nearly 1,000 people were shot and killed by police in 2018 and that at least 265 others have met with the same fate this year. The numbers include cases of unarmed shooting victims that have drawn international criticism.

“Despite continuing concerns from civil rights and community-based organizations, the department has sharply curtailed its statutory role in identifying and eradicating civil rights abuses by law enforcement,” the lawmakers’ letter said. Justice Department officials were not immediately available to comment.

Among the documents sought by the Democratic lawmakers are memos written by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who implemented policies that critics say sharply curtailed the ability of Justice Department civil rights attorneys to rein in unconstitutional policing.

The lawmakers gave Barr until June 5 to comply with their request."

DOJ tries to disqualify ex-Obama official from defending China’s Huawei,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Bebeto Matthews'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei,"The Justice Department is working to disqualify top Obama department official James Cole from defending the Chinese technology firm Huawei in a high-profile criminal case, according to a new heavily redacted federal court filing on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Huawei in January 2019 which charged the company with bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering, obstruction of justice, illegal actions related to dodging Iran sanctions, and more. Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2015, has been representing Huawei in this matter since 2017, but the Justice Department’s motion is an attempt to convince the court that Cole’s previous experiences investigating Huawei-related matters while at the department should disqualify him.

Cole held the second-highest position in the Obama Justice Department for five years, where he worked with Attorney General Eric Holder, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the department, and represented the department on the National Security Council. He brought those experiences to Sidley, one of the largest law firms in the country, where he is the global co-lead of their White Collar: Government Litigation and Investigations practice and where he has defended Huawei for the past couple years.

Justice Department attorneys told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York that “Cole should be disqualified from representing Huawei Tech and Huawei USA in this case because of two different conflicts.” The details the department provided on the first conflict were heavily redacted. The agency said that “having represented the government in his role as DAG in the DOJ's [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED], Cole should not now be allowed to represent the defendants in a [REDACTED] matter brought by the DOJ that is substantially related in multiple respects to that [REDACTED] investigation.” Therefore, the department said that “Cole should be disqualified because he was personally and substantially involved in a [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED] that exposed him to relevant, privileged factual information [REDACTED] and strategic information about that investigation.”

The Justice Department did not specify those prior investigations.

The agency said the second conflict is that “Cole's representation of the defendants jeopardizes the government's interest in having a fair trial and obtaining a conviction that can sustain appeal and collateral attack.” Their claim was that, due to Cole’s past involvement in Justice Department investigations related to the Huawei case, he would not be able to provide Huawei with a proper defense and that “any representation by Cole would taint the trial process and any ultimate conviction.”

The Justice Department met with Cole related to his alleged conflict of interest multiple times in January and February 2019. Cole declined to recuse himself in March 2019, stating, “We have carefully considered the material you showed us and were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified based on that information.”

For its part, Huawei released a statement saying the Justice Department “has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter” and that its motion “makes a mockery of the adversarial process.” Huawei says that this is an attempt by the department “to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice … while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The Justice Department has been increasing its scrutiny of China’s activities in recent years, launching a ""China Initiative"" in 2018 and charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. The department has turned its sights on Huawei’s alleged criminality: Aside from charging the company and its connected entities, the U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Wanzhou Meng, who the U.S. believes was involved in the criminal conspiracy.

The U.S. government widely suspects that the Chinese-based Huawei, a technology firm that is a global leader in telecommunications and in 5G, is working hand in hand with the Chinese government, giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Discussing the U.S.’s intelligence-sharing relationships with the United Kingdom and other European allies who are considering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned, “We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network. We’re happy to continue to look at technology and see ways we might achieve that, but the United States for its part will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China or China’s government.”

The Department of Defense’s annual report to Congress on China, released in May, stressed that China is a growing threat not just in terms of hard power military capabilities but also in terms of cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration. The Defense Department pointed out that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

Cole is not the only former high-ranking Obama official representing China-based Huawei’s interests. Samir Jain, who was the senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, registered as a lobbyist for Huawei earlier this year.

EPA orders river excavation near polluted Wolverine tannery,https://www.mlive.com,"['Garret Ellison', 'Gellison Mlive.Com']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/05/epa-orders-river-excavation-near-polluted-wolverine-tannery.html,"ROCKFORD, MI — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered Wolverine World Wide to dig contaminated sediment from the Rogue River and excavate soils along the White Pine Trail in Rockford, where the shoemaker formerly operated a century-old leather tannery.

The EPA listed the actions among several public health-driven cleanup steps federal regulators want Wolverine to take this summer in a letter on April 29. The order follows test results that show high levels of pollutants like chromium, mercury, and PFAS befoul the site.

“There may be exposure risks that can’t necessarily wait for an overall plan to address the entire site,” said Jeff Kimble, a Region 5 EPA on-scene coordinator who is supervising Wolverine’s former tannery and dump site investigations in Kent County.

By the end of May, the EPA says Wolverine must begin placing signs and kiosks near river access points which note potential hazards nearby and the proper hygiene for dealing with them.

The EPA wants the site work to happen this summer. Wolverine said it is “reviewing” the letter and “looks forward to continuing its work with the agency to develop next steps.""

The EPA began supervising an investigation into contamination at the tannery and Wolverine’s House Street sludge dump in Belmont last year. The tannery, which was razed in 2009, drew federal scrutiny after the discovery of per-fluorinated compounds called PFAS at the former factory grounds and Wolverine’s nearby waste dumps.

In Belmont, the EPA wants interior fencing around the “entire contaminated portion” of the House Street dump and further testing of wetlands to the west. The 76-acre site where Wolverine dumped 3M Scotchgard waste in the 1960s has spawned a PFAS plume moving southeast through an area where thousands of people rely on groundwater for drinking.

An investigation report for House Street similar to that which sparked cleanup work in Rockford is pending final EPA final approval, Kimble said.

DEQ ignored crucial warning on Wolverine dump plume FOIA emails illuminate early House Street PFAS investigation.

In Rockford, toxic substances like mercury, chromium and lead are confirmed at high levels in the groundwater and in sediment near spots where people regularly launch canoes and kayaks alongside a heavily-used White Pine Trail stretch.

Kimble ordered Wolverine to either dredge or de-water and excavate those areas. He said the company proposed placing gravel and matting over contamination, but “based on the data we have, I think it’s more prudent to remove some of those sediments and then place that mat-and-gravel material.”

Kimble said cleanup work may close parts of the trail this summer. Users will also find more information about potential health risks at canoe launches and river access points.

Existing handwashing stations and signs placed last year are inadequate, Kimble said. The signs face away from the trail and tell people to “wash hands” when exiting the river with no explanation.

A sign tells people to ""wash hands"" upon exiting the river at the White Pine Trail in Rockford on May 6, 2019 near the former Wolverine World Wide tannery site.

“It should be more than just ‘wash your hands,'"" Kimble said. “Kindergarteners are told to wash their hands. They probably need to know why.”

”The signs need to be informative and cautionary, but also not unduly alarm people.""

Thad Beard, Rockford city manager, said that, while enhanced signage isn’t necessarily a great image for the city, it’s an important part of public communication.

“The reality is that we’re dealing with an environmental cleanup here and it’s important that is known to the public,” Beard said.

As in years past, Beard said the city will use part of the tannery site for its Start of Summer festival, June 13-16. Beard said Rockford checked with EPA to ensure the site of a city parking lot under construction on the property’s south end “wasn’t an area of high concentration of anything.”

The EPA-ordered work is happening parallel to Wolverine’s plan to stem the flow of groundwater contaminated with PFAS into the river, where the so-called “forever chemicals” are causing surface water foam to gather at the Rockford dam.

Beard said concern about the river foam has spiked recently following the state health department warning to avoid touching it.

Wolverine installed pump-and-treat wells at the site this winter as part of a plan to filter groundwater through a granular activated carbon (GAC) system to remove PFAS before sending treated effluent to the North Kent Sewer Authority wastewater plant. The sewer board should decide whether it will accept Wolverine’s cleanup water this summer.

Toxic pollution at Wolverine tannery is extensive, new report shows The study is the first comprehensive account of pollution at the former Wolverine World Wide tannery.

U.S. Energy Department says oil markets well supplied after attack on ships off UAE,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-oil-emirates-doe/us-energy-department-says-oil-markets-well-supplied-after-attack-on-ships-off-uae-idUSKCN1SJ1UF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department said on Monday that global oil markets are well supplied despite the attack on Sunday that damaged four vessels off the UAE coast, two of them oil tankers from Saudi Arabia.

“The Department of Energy is aware of efforts to disrupt oil shipping as reported by the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” said Shaylyn Hynes, DOE press secretary, about the attack near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz.

The UAE did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

“The Department is monitoring the oil markets, and is confident they remain well-supplied,” Hynes said after the attack which did not cause any casualties, or an oil spill, but resulted in significant damage to the ships."

"Lawsuit accusing DHS of blocking migrants' right to counsel can proceed in D.C., judge rules",https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/443605-lawsuit-accusing-dhs-of-blocking-migrants-right-to-counsel-can,"A federal judge ruled Friday that a court case accusing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of blocking migrants' right to counsel at a facility in Louisiana and two facilities in Georgia can proceed as one case in Washington, D.C., where DHS is headquartered.

Federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied the government's motion to separate the cases and move them to district courts.

""In an exercise of its discretion, the Court decides not to sever the claims in this case into three separate cases,"" she wrote. ""The Court also decides that the interests of justice do not warrant transfer of the unsevered case to a different forum.""

The lawsuit, filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), claims that there are barriers to accessing attorneys at immigrant detention facilities in Jena, La., Lumpkin, Ga., and Ocilla, Ga.

""The totality of barriers to accessing and communicating with attorneys endured by detainees in these prisons deprives SPLC’s clients of their constitutional rights to access courts, to access counsel, and to obtain full and fair hearings, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,"" the suit argues.

SPLC Deputy Legal Director Lisa Graybill praised the ruling in a Tuesday statement.

“Friday’s ruling allows us to litigate the merits across all three detention centers so there is proper nationwide enforcement of standards governing access to attorneys for people in detention,” she said.

The Hill has reached out to DHS and the Justice Department."
"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."
EPA moves to ease water-quality standards in Washington state; Inslee and Ferguson say that’s illegal,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inslee-ferguson-denounce-epa-move-to-ease-water-standards-for-washington-state/,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ease Washington water-quality standards for chemicals discharged into state waterways, a move embraced by industry groups that sought the change and denounced as “illegal” by Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

The action, disclosed Friday, reverses a 2016 decision by the EPA under the Obama administration that required the state to toughen the water-quality standard.

Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, said his agency had “inherent authority” to reconsider the 2016 decision, according to a letter Hladick sent Friday to Maia Bellon, the director of the state Ecology Department.

Ferguson and Inslee, in a joint statement, said “by taking this unilateral action, the EPA will risk almost certain litigation and cause uncertainty for Washington businesses.”

A major point of contention is the water-quality standard for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a group of chemicals considered to be probable carcinogens. PCBs can be found in dyes, paint, building materials, coolants and other products. In trace amounts, they often are present in industry wastewater discharges as well as municipal utility plants that treat stormwater runoff. Once in Puget Sound and freshwater drainage, they accumulate in fish and shellfish, so ingesting this food in large volumes can increase cancer risks.

In Washington, the PCBs water standard has been subject of years of intense scrutiny.

Tribal leaders pressed for tighter pollution limits to protect their members, who may eat far more fish and shellfish than other Washington residents. They were dismayed by the Trump administration’s EPA decision, which they said was done without the consultation required by the federal government’s treaties and trust responsibilities to tribes.

“This action is outrageous,” said Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. “Like all federal agencies, the EPA has a legally binding trust responsibility to the tribes that requires government-to-government consultation and the protection of tribal treaty rights and resources. They are not living up to this responsibility that is rooted in the U.S. Constitution.”

Paper and pulp manufacturers and other industry groups applauded the Trump administration decision.

They had opposed the Obama administration standard, saying that there was no technology available to bring wastewater discharge of PCBs to the low levels that were required. In a written statement, Donna Harmon, president of the American Forest & Paper Association, said, “The earlier EPA rule represented costly and ineffective regulatory overreach — plain and simple.”

The clash over PCB standards has unfolded under the umbrella of the federal Clean Water Act, which creates a partnership between the state and federal government to protect and when necessary restore the nation’s waterways.

Under the act, states have authority to develop water-quality standards, and the EPA the power of review.

During the Obama administration, the EPA partially disapproved of a state standard — developed by the Washington Department of Ecology while Inslee was governor. The EPA ruled the state standard for PCBs — 170 parts per quadrillion in wastewater discharges — did not go far enough in protecting the health of heavy consumers of Washington fish. Instead, the EPA sent a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion.

In February 2017, after the Trump administration took office, industry and water utility groups filed a petition to the EPA arguing that the action under the Obama administration unjustly overturned the state standard and that it should be pulled back.

Meanwhile, state officials accepted the EPA decision and went to work with stakeholders, including tribes and industry representatives, to find ways to implement new standards.

Colleen Keltz, an Ecology Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 7 parts per quadrillion standard may not be obtainable with current technology. But she said that the state is working under a new system that allows permitted discharges to have a variance that allows higher levels of discharges until technology is available to meet the standard.

But the EPA, under the Trump administration, dismissed the need to try to reach the lower standard. In a 32-page document released Friday, the EPA said the earlier state PCBs standard of 170 parts per quadrillion should be restored, saying that that standard was based on sound science.

Hladick’s criticisms of the 2016 EPA PCBs decision were rejected by Dennis McLerran, who served as regional administrator for the EPA under President Barack Obama. McLerran acknowledged that some standards are “aspirational” but said the earlier EPA action was based on the best science available and that the rule allowed for flexibility when dischargers could not meet the standard.

McLerran said it was “very unusual and inappropriate” to pull it back without first consulting with tribes and state officials.

“I think it is a very unfortunate thing. The state had made it clear that it was implementing the standards, and found them to be correct,” McLerran said.

State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, disagrees with McLerran.

In a note sent this week to Ecology Department Director Bellon, Ericksen wrote that the initial state water-quality rule was the product of years of work by legislators, state officials and stakeholders. Ericksen said he was confused why Bellon would now oppose efforts to restore that rule, and urged that she reconsider that position."
