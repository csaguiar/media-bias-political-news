Canadian newspaper publisher cuts ties with artist behind controversial Trump cartoon,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/canadian-newspaper-publisher-artist-trump-cartoon-golf-migrants,"A Canadian artist's freelance contract with a newspaper publishing company was terminated days after one of his cartoons depicting President Trump mocking the recent drowning deaths of a migrant father and daughter went viral on social media.

The El Salvadoran migrant father and his 2-year-old daughter had drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande River in Mexico last week. The grim image of their dead bodies lying face down in the Mexican side of the river further animated the ongoing debate in the U.S. about illegal immigration.

In a statement Sunday, Brunswick Media Inc. (BMI) denied that it had severed ties with artist Michael de Adder over the cartoon, which was published Wednesday.

""This is a false narrative which has emerged carelessly and recklessly on social media,"" the company said in a statement. ""In fact, BNI was not even offered this cartoon by Mr. de Adder.""

In the cartoon, which de Adder tweeted from his account, Trump was shown standing beside a golf cart, holding a golf club and looking down at the bodies of the two migrants, Oscar Alberto Martínez and his daughter, Valeria.

""Do you mind if I play through?"" the cartoon version of Trump asked, a phrase used by golfers confronted with slow play ahead of them.

De Adder announced that BNI had cut ties with him on Twitter Friday and called the move ""a setback not a deathblow.""

""I'm not the type of person who's going to make a career out of being fired,"" de Adder tweeted Saturday. ""I'm still successfully drawing cartoons for other publications. I just need to recoup a percentage of my weekly income and get used to the idea I no longer have a voice in my home province.""

BMI owns most major print media outlets in New Brunswick, including three daily newspapers and a total of 21 English and French-language weeklies.

Wes Tyrell, the president of the Association of Canadian Cartoonists, posted on Facebook Saturday that the termination of de Adder's contract ""was no coincidence"" and blamed BMI owner James Irving for not wanting to offend the American president.

""Michael told me once that not only were the [industrial conglomerate] J.D. Irving owned New Brunswick newspapers challenging to work for,"" Tyrell wrote, ""but there were a series of taboo subjects he could not touch. One of these taboo subjects was Donald Trump.""

"" ... de Adder's Trump cartoons didn't appear in the newspaper but they were viewed all across social media, something that probably went unnoticed most days by Irving. But his cartoon of June 26 couldn't be ignored,"" Tyrell added. ""... It went viral and social media stars like ['Star Trek' actor] George Takei even shared it. For a brief period de Adder was the poster boy for the Anti-Trump movement. A good place to be if you're a cartoonist, but a bad place to be if you work for a foreign oil company with business ties to the United States ... A solid reason why an oil company has no business owning newspapers."""
Byron York: Anti-Trump fever takes threatening turn,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/byron-york-anti-trump-fever-takes-threatening-turn,"The toxicity of the resistance to President Trump has risen in recent days, with the nation's most respected newspapers publishing rationalizations for denying Trump supporters public accommodation and for doxxing career federal employees, while a journalist found himself under physical attack from the so-called anti-fascist group Antifa, which has stepped up its violent activities since Trump's election.

The justification for denying public accommodation came from the Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous in June of last year, when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders and and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant. Wilkinson's staff then followed the Sanders group in protest as they tried to find another place to eat.

Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is ""inhumane and unethical"" and because the Red Hen ""has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation.""

In her new article, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president's son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump ""new rules apply"" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.

""If you're directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home,"" Wilkinson wrote.

Wilkinson noted that ""no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron,"" but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a ""frustrated person"" — for example, a restaurant employee — will ""lash[] out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs."" Americans should accept that such things will happen.

""If you're an unsavory individual,"" Wilkinson concluded, ""we have no legal or moral obligation to do business with you."" Better to stay home than risk the spittle. (And of course, Wilkinson and her colleagues in the hospitality industry will decide who is ""unsavory."")

The apology for doxxing came from the New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.

Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda. Those are, of course, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous and offensive but which Cronin-Furman and the New York Times apparently take seriously. Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.

Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are ""sensitive to social pressure,"" Cronin-Furman wrote, ""which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and desistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda, and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity.""

""This is not an argument for doxxing,"" Cronin-Furman continued. ""It's about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father's arms is a serious social cost to bear. The desire to avoid this kind of social shame may be enough to persuade some agents to quit and may hinder the recruitment of replacements. For those who won't (or can't) quit, it may induce them to treat the vulnerable individuals under their control more humanely. In Denmark during World War II, for instance, strong social pressure, including from churches, contributed to the refusal of the country to comply with Nazi orders to deport its Jewish citizens.""

Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.

Finally, there was Antifa's recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, at which Trump was a focus of dispute, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.

The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville, in which feelings about Trump have played a role.

Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

What Trump’s Huawei Reversal Means for the Future of 5G,https://www.nytimes.com,['Andrew Ross Sorkin'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/dealbook/huawei-5g-national-security-trade.html,"In an impromptu question-and-answer session late last month at the White House, President Trump was asked about the nation’s efforts to block Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, from doing business in the United States and with our allies around the globe.

“Huawei is something that is very dangerous,” Mr. Trump said. Then, almost in the same breath, he added: “It’s possible that Huawei would be included in a trade deal. If we made a deal, I can imagine Huawei being included in some form or some part of a trade deal.”

Over the weekend in Japan, Mr. Trump appeared to choose trade over national security, suspending the ban on United States companies’ supplying equipment to Huawei as he hopes to reach a trade deal with President Xi Jinping of China. Without providing any details, he declared that American companies could sell to Huawei without creating a “great, national emergency problem.”

He said this even as own secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, spent the past several months traveling the world warning our allies that Huawei is a profoundly dangerous security threat and instructing them to freeze out the company."
"Ivanka Trump: Adviser, daughter, and, this week, diplomat",https://www.cnn.com,"['Betsy Klein', 'Kaitlan Collins']",06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/ivanka-trump-g20-north-korea/index.html,"Seoul (CNN) It was the eve of President Donald Trump's historic steps into North Korea , and as the US delegation was lining up for a photo op with their South Korean counterparts at the Blue House, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo paced behind the group, looking for his opening.

Trump and President Moon Jae-in had taken their places in the center, followed by Moon's wife, Kim Jung-sook. The next US official in line was not a member of Trump's Cabinet or national security team, but his daughter and senior adviser Ivanka Trump.

As the cameras flashed and Pompeo awkwardly shuffled around, it took the first daughter a moment to realize he was trying to slide in. She eventually moved aside to let the secretary of state take his place between her and the South Korean first lady.

The moment encapsulated the unusually prominent role Ivanka Trump has played during Trump's trip to Asia: a first daughter assuming the spotlight and duty beyond that of a senior aide on the world stage, the latest in her ongoing efforts to style herself as a diplomat.

Back in Washington, national security officials bristled at the large presence Ivanka assumed while overseas. But those close to the President described it as business as usual.

In the spotlight

The administration -- the East Wing, in particular -- has made it clear that Ivanka Trump is not the first lady. But Melania Trump, who accompanied the President on recent trips to Europe and Tokyo, skipped the visit to Osaka for the G20 summit and following trip to Seoul. Her communications director and now White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham , declined to provide a reason for the absence. In turn, the first daughter asserted herself abroad this week in unique and unprecedented fashion as both a member of the US delegation and a member of the President's family.

Never before has a President's child had the proximity, influence and the marketing savvy to create a space in an administration, and that was on display from the G20 to the demilitarized zone as she appeared on equal footing with Cabinet-level officials. One sign of that: Her efforts to build relationships with world leaders at gatherings such as these.

Over the course of the four-day trip, Ivanka Trump attended multiple bilateral meetings at the G20 in Osaka. She was on stage for a women's economic empowerment forum with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, delivering remarks on her Women's Global Development and Prosperity initiative.

The French government released a video of her trying to make conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, IMF chairwoman Christine Lagarde and British Prime Minister Theresa May.

She appeared on camera in a video published by the White House giving a readout of a trilateral meeting between the President, Indian President Narendra Modi and Abe, a responsibility traditionally carried out by a national security staffer in a written statement. In the video, Trump speaks directly to the camera about the ""productive morning, to say the least,"" occasionally averting her eyes.

Trump also traveled with the delegation to Seoul, where she attended the dinner at the Blue House, had a discussion on women in the global economy with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and visited the DMZ, where her father shook hands with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and became the first sitting US president to step into North Korea

Trump's national security adviser was absent from the stop because an aide said he had already departed Korea for a scheduled visit to Mongolia to ""discuss regional security, infrastructure and economic issues."" And Pompeo remained largely in the background during the high-profile trip, only appearing on camera behind the President as he made closing remarks. But while her father met with Kim inside for approximately 50 minutes, Trump crossed the line into North Korea -- inside a blue shelter and away from the cameras -- while senior officials like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney waited outside. Asked by a reporter in the traveling press pool how North Korea was, she replied, ""Surreal.""

Accountability

Ivanka Trump previously raised eyebrows among Trump critics during her attendance at the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg when she briefly sat in for her father during one of the meetings with world leaders. She has since become more neatly tailored to issues of women's economic empowerment and workforce development. Yet she still advises her father on a myriad of issues internally. She has been one of his longest and most-trusted advisers, starting with her time in the family real estate business.

Former Obama State Department spokesperson, Pentagon press secretary and CNN analyst John Kirby said that her outsized role during the trip raises ""legitimate concerns"" regarding the transparency of Trump's responsibilities as a White House official, and, subsequently, her lack of accountability mechanisms as an unelected staffer.

""It raises real questions about what policy issues does she have a stake in and does she have authority to speak for the United States on,"" Kirby said to CNN.

To him, her visibility is an ""optics problem"" for the administration.

""I found it fairly stunning that she had a seat at so many tables and was involved in so many bilateral policy discussions,"" he said. ""It certainly doesn't help America's standing on the world's stage as a democratic representative government because she wasn't elected by anybody and hasn't been formally appointed to any position.""

A White House official did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

The Ivanka Influence

Both Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have enjoyed a wider range of access since Mulvaney replaced John Kelly as chief of staff . Mulvaney has maintained a hands-off approach, unlike his predecessor, and does not try to limit their influence or access to the Oval Office. Officials attribute this as one reason he has had success as chief of staff. While one official described Mulvaney as seeking to ""empower"" the two senior aides for their own benefit, others in the White House see it as a shrewd move designed to keep him in his job longer. So far, it has worked for Mulvaney, who recognizes that Trump and Kushner are the only aides with essentially full job security.

In turn, Trump and Kushner have viewed Mulvaney as an ally in the administration, even if the chief of staff's own influence with the President is somewhat limited. While Mulvaney is trusted by key members of Trump's inner circle, the two men have little chemistry and interact less frequently than during other chiefs of staff's tenures.

Her camera-facing role this week comes amid speculation about her political future.

""If she ever wanted to run for president,"" Donald Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic earlier this year, ""I think she'd be very, very hard to beat.""

But the President told the magazine that his daughter hasn't expressed any interest in running to him.

At the conclusion of the trip's events on Sunday, the President called his daughter and Pompeo to the stage as he addressed troops at Osan Air Base.

""Has anyone heard of Ivanka? Come up, Ivanka. She's going to steal the show,"" he said, calling the Pompeo-Ivanka duo ""Beauty and the Beast."""
These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'July At Am']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

Kim, through a translator, called Trump's decision to meet with him a ""courageous and determined act.""

""I just want to thank you, it was very quick notice and I just want to thank you,"" Trump said.

""Good to see you again, I never expected to see you in this place,"" Kim said as they initially shook hands.

Both leaders spoke, standing side by side, before heading into a bilateral meeting in a nearby building.

""Tremendous positivity, really great things are happening"" Trump said. ""We met and we liked each other from day one and that was very important.""

After Trump and Kim met for more than 40 minutes, they emerged together from the Freedom House -- along with Moon -- and walked side-by-side back to the demarcation line, where Trump and Moon bid Kim farewell.

Back inside Freedom House, Trump declared it a ""great"" and ""legendary"" day and said they agreed to formulate teams to restart active negotiations for a comprehensive agreement. Trump said Steve Biegun, U.S. special representative for North Korea, would lead the U.S. side.

""We just had a very, very good meeting with Chairman Kim and we’ve agreed that we’re going to designate a team, and the team will try and work out some deals, and again speed is not the object, we want to see if we can do a really comprehensive good deal.""

""Nobody knows how things go, but certainly this was a great day. This was a very legendary, very historic day,"" Trump said.

""It will be more historic if something comes of it, something very important, but a lot has already come of it,"" Trump continued, pointing to the relationships that have been built through engaging directly with the North Koreans and claimed it was a ""fiery mess"" during the previous administration.

Prior to sitting down for their extended talk, the president said he would be inviting Kim to visit him at the White House.

""If it was not for the excellent relationship between us, it would not have been possible,"" Kim said during the bilateral.

Trump then spoke and first complimented the strength of Kim's voice.

""You hear the power of that voice, nobody's heard the voice before, he doesn't do news conferences, in case you haven't noticed, and this was a special moment,"" Trump said.

""This is an historic moment, the fact that we're meeting,"" Trump continued.

The president then thanked Kim for not turning down his invitation to meet at the border, because ""if he didn't show up, the press was going to make us both look bad.""

AP Photo/Susan Walsh

""You made us both look good and I appreciate it,"" Trump said.

""It was an honor that you asked me to step over that line, and I was proud to step over that line. I thought you might do that, I wasn't sure, but I was ready to do it, and I want to thank you, it was great, very historic,"" Trump said.

Trump arrived at the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) just before 2 a.m. Eastern time in a prelude to a historic meeting with Kim. Trump visited an observation tower, looking into the secluded North, where many U.S. presidents have stopped before.

But unlike previous presidents, Trump later met with Kim at Panmunjeom, the so-called Peace Village, on the border between the two countries and possibly cross over the line and become the first-ever president to visit North Korea.

Trump made brief comments from the overlook: ""After our first summit, all the danger went away,"" Trump claimed. ""I say that for the press, when they say there's been no difference. There's been a tremendous difference.""

He visited U.S. troops at the border afterward, was given the gift of a jacket and signed the wall as has become tradition for presidents.

Just hours before, Trump announced he was set to travel to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Moon joined Trump in his visit to the border.

""I’ll be meeting with Chairman Kim I look forward to it very much. I look forward to seeing him, we’ve developed a very good relationship,"" Trump said at the press conference. ""We understand each other. I do believe he understands me and I think I maybe understand him. And sometimes that can lead to very good things.""

""I put out the word and he got back, and he wanted to do it from the beginning and so did I,"" Trump continued.

Expanding on his decision Saturday to extend a last-minute invite to Kim to meet him at the DMZ, Trump said the trip was ""something I planned long ago, but had the idea yesterday, to maybe, say 'hello,' just shake and quickly say 'hello.'""

Asked about the possibility of a third summit, Trump said he'd like to see what happens Sunday before talking about another meeting.

""Let’s see what happens today before we start thinking about that,"" Trump said.

The president also claimed -- falsely -- that former President Barack Obama sought to meet with Kim and that he was rebuffed.

""The Obama administration was begging for a meeting, there were begging for meetings constantly, and Chairman Kim would not meet him,"" Trump claimed.

The president continued to express optimism about the state of relations with North Korea and insisted that important progress has been made through both of his previous summits with Kim.

""I'm not in a rush,"" Trump said. ""If you're in a rush you get yourself in trouble.""

On Sunday morning in South Korea, Trump said that Kim ""very much wants to"" meet, and that the two countries are ""trying to work it out. Both want to do it.""

""Very short, it would be very short, virtually a handshake,"" Trump said. ""But that’s OK. A handshake means a lot.""

AP Photo/Susan Walsh

Trump has even raised the possibility of stepping across the border into North Korea -- something no previous U.S. president has done.

""Sure, I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem,"" Trump said earlier in his Asia trip.

The two leaders have met on two occasions. Their most recent meeting in February in Hanoi, Vietnam, failed to produce an agreement toward the goal of North Koreas' denuclearization.

Trump announced yesterday that he would be traveling to the DMZ during his visit to South Korea and issued an impromptu Twitter invitation to the North Korean leader to have a brief visit and share a handshake.

After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2019

Since that time, a senior administration official said that the governments of the United States, North Korea and South Korea have been in communication to prepare for the prospective meeting.

In remarks Sunday morning at a breakfast with Korean business leaders, President Trump suggested that a meeting was likely to happen.

""I understand they want to meet and I’d love to say hello,"" Trump said.

Trump is also expected to meet with U.S. service members following his brief meeting with Kim.

Asked by ABC News’ Jonathan Karl in a press conference Saturday if it will be a bad sign if the North Korean leader doesn’t take him up on his offer to meet, the president said it would not.

""No,"" Trump told Karl. ""Of course, I thought of that because I know if he didn’t, everybody is going to say, ‘Oh, he was stood up by Chairman Kim.’ No, I understood that.""

The president went on to say that the North Korean leader must follow him on Twitter, because U.S. officials ""got a call very quickly"" after he sent out his tweet.

The president said if the meeting does happen, it would only be a brief one.

""We'll see each other for two minutes,"" Trump said. ""That will be fine."""
House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies,https://thehill.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/450970-fresh-leadership-churn-at-dhs-agencies,"The leadership carousel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took another spin this week as the agency underwent fresh changes among officials tasked with enforcing immigration law.

Roughly 10 weeks after a purge of DHS leaders that included former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenFresh leadership churn at DHS agencies Booker calls for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement Customs and Border Protection chief to step down MORE, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly resigned and the agency announced a new head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

And there are rumblings that acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan is not on solid ground. Some of President Trump Donald John TrumpOcasio-Cortez knocks Trump for bringing Ivanka to G20 summit Klobuchar on Trump's North Korea visit: Diplomacy is not like 'bringing a hot dish over the fence to the dictator next door' After fractious Democratic debate, Perez tries to draw contrast to Trump MORE’s allies and outside groups that favor stricter immigration laws are expressing frustration with McAleenan, suggesting further changes could be on the horizon as the president seeks to implement the right mix of loyalists and immigration hardliners to implement his agenda heading into 2020.

""I've made changes — very good changes,"" Trump told reporters this past week. ""We're moving some people around into different locations.""

McAleenan announced this week that Mark Morgan, previously the acting director of ICE, would move over to lead CBP in the wake of John Sanders's resignation.

Morgan, who led Border Patrol during the Obama administration, made clear in an interview with The Hill earlier this month that he intended to carry out Trump's policies.

Replacing Morgan at ICE is Matthew Albence, a 25-year law enforcement veteran who has held various roles in the Trump administration since 2017.

The president said he was aware there would be a change when Sanders announced his CBP resignation. But Trump did not say whether he asked Sanders to step down, and Sanders did not provide a reason for his resignation.

""I don’t know anything about it,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I hear he's a very good man. I hear he's a good person. I don’t know him. I don’t think I ever spoke to him.""

Morgan and Albence's appointments follow Trump tapping Ken Cucinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia attorney general, as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.

Trump also announced former ICE Director Tom Homan would return to the administration as ""border czar."" Homan has appeared regularly on Fox News to defend the president's policies, but it's unclear if or when he might return to government work or what his duties would entail.

Homan was sharply critical this week of McAleenan, suggesting he has not been supportive of Trump's agenda and has hindered ICE from doing its job.

The White House did not respond to questions about the recent shakeup at DHS, including whether Trump ordered the personnel changes.

The latest reshuffling came as House Democrats clashed over a bill to provide additional border funding and as Democratic presidential candidates made the treatment of migrants a central tenet of the party’s first two debates.

The president has often argued that congressional inaction is largely to blame for the surge in border apprehensions and poor humanitarian conditions for migrants. But the recent turnover atop DHS suggests growing impatience with that agency as well.

Any frustration by Trump with the agency’s performance could prove problematic for McAleenan.

Multiple advocates for Trump view McAleenan as a placeholder and have criticized him in recent weeks for failing to aggressively pursue the president's immigration priorities.

""He just basically has been a stumbling block for basically any enforcement that either CBP or ICE or USCIS wanted to do,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The Washington Post reported this month that McAleenan was uneasy with Trump's call for mass ICE raids to round up migrant families with deportation orders. McAleenan was said to have favored a more targeted approach.

Trump on June 22 postponed the raids for ""two weeks"" to give Congress time to attempt to pass legislation overhauling the country's asylum laws.

McAleenan denied in an interview with Fox News Radio on Thursday that he was the source of leaks to the media that jeopardized the raids, but wouldn’t say explicitly if there were any Trump policies that he disagreed with.

“That's not my role. I'm an operator, I'm a law enforcement professional, the president sets policy and we implement,” McAleenan said. “We implement in the best way we know how based on our operational experience.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump planned to nominate the acting secretary for the role full-time.

Ur Jaddou, who was chief counsel to USCIS during the Obama administration, told The Hill that McAleenan's job has been complicated by the consistent turnover within his department.

""To have people at the top constantly changing and changing their direction on policy and how to approach things is completely disruptive which is why I call it chaos,"" she said in an interview.

Jaddou said she could not recall any comparable amount of turnover to what has taken place at DHS in recent months.

Andrew R. Arthur, who served in the former Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, was complimentary of McAleenan but was unsure of his long-term role. He described McAleenan as a ""very competent administrator"" and noted his wealth of experience from leading CBP.

McAleenan has been under additional scrutiny this past week as concerns over the administration's treatment of migrants gained a new sense of urgency.

Hundreds of children were moved from a detention facility in Texas after the Associated Press reported on poor conditions, including kids taking care of other kids and a lack of sanitation.

That same week, a photo went viral of a man and his daughter who drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande River. Democrats seized on the image to decry the Trump administration's policies.

""In another administration an acting secretary would be out immediately,"" Jaddou said of the response to the photo. ""The person would not survive more than a day.""

McAleenan addressed the photo in a press conference Friday, calling the incident tragic and devastating, but deflected blame away from his own agency.

""This failure is not on the men and women of DHS, and definitely not on the outstanding border patrol agents, and CBP officers and ICE officers who have borne the brunt to the challenges and most of the criticism,"" he said.

McAleenan expressed appreciation for Congress for passing a funding package that includes $4.5 billion in resources for agencies responding to the influx of migrants.

Many Democrats panned the final version of the bill, saying it did not do enough to protect migrant children.

Still, McAleenan said the onus is on Congress to take further action, and he urged lawmakers to close immigration loopholes and approve changes to asylum laws.

""This situation should not be acceptable to any of us,"" McAleenan said. ""It should galvanize action and real debate based on what is actually happening on the border and why. And yet, here in Washington, we have collectively failed to act to address the drivers of the crisis."""

Would-Be Democratic Presidents Want to Make America a Sanctuary Country,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/30/would-be_democratic_presidents_want_to_make_america_a_sanctuary_country__140680.html,"WASHINGTON -- The star of Thursday night's Democratic presidential primary debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was attorney general of California and, before that, district attorney for San Francisco. This put her in the vanguard of the Golden State's sanctuary state and sanctuary city policies.

Now, it seems, all the 2020 Democratic hopefuls -- and Harris in particular -- are trying to turn the United States into one big sanctuary country where crossing the border illegally is analogous to jaywalking.

That's why all 10 Democrats raised their hands Thursday night when asked if they wanted to make crossing the border without documentation a civil rather than criminal offense. They all also raised their hands when asked if they wanted to provide health care to unauthorized immigrants.

During the debate, Harris framed the practice of shielding undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement this way: ""I know it as a prosecutor. I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle of -- to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her.""

It was a variation of an argument crafted earlier by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who as mayor of San Francisco pushed through the city's first sanctuary policy in 1985. It applied to undocumented migrants from El Salvador and Guatemala. The law, expanded to all undocumented immigrants by city voters in 1989, would make San Francisco safer, DiFi argued, because undocumented residents would not be afraid to report crimes to city police.

But as the policy expanded, it didn't just protect otherwise law-abiding immigrants -- hard-working adults who came here to work and raise a family. It also has shielded gang members and criminals who harm women and children, as Harris well knows.

San Francisco's 2013 Due Process for All ordinance prohibited local law enforcement from holding unauthorized immigrants for federal immigration officials unless the inmate had been convicted of a violent felony in the past seven years. What could go wrong? Many a career car thief or repeat drug offender has enjoyed the same protection as the rape victim Harris said she wanted to protect.

The most famous beneficiary was Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. After he served time for his seventh felony drug conviction, the feds sent Garcia Zarate to San Francisco on a 20-year-old marijuana charge. The district attorney inevitably did not pursue the moldy case, and so Garcia Zarate walked out on the street, where he found a gun used to kill Kate Steinle on a summer evening in 2015.

Please tell me: What country passes laws to protect career criminals and repeat offenders from being deported?

In his first term, President Barack Obama had a smarter take when he directed federal officials to target unauthorized immigrants who were ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes.""

He expanded the Secure Communities program, piloted by President George W. Bush, which cross-checked fingerprints taken at local jails with immigration databases. It was a smart plan. In fiscal 2013, The Los Angeles Times reported, 82% of deported individuals had been convicted of a crime.

During the debate, however, Harris railed against Obama's use of Secure Communities because, well, ""The policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals."" (Actually, that's also the definition of Thursday night's debate team, as they all said they'd like to make unauthorized border crossing a civil offense instead of a crime.)

Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies observed that Harris referred to rape as a ""real crime"":

""That's a standard sanctuary city line,"" says Krikorian. ""At this point, it's now Democratic Party orthodoxy that only people that have broken 'real' laws should be subject to deportation.""

And those crimes would have to be tried and convicted and have been committed recently to warrant removal. The ""tool in the toolbox"" of being able to deport an undesirable newcomer who's not supposed to be in the United States in the first place, Krikorian warned, would disappear.

What would happen if Democrats were to end criminal penalties for crossing the border? Does anyone think there would be fewer unauthorized immigrants or more? And would they be more law-abiding otherwise or less?

Repeat of border aid battle expected with Homeland Security bill,https://thehill.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/450977-border-aid-battle-set-for-round-two-with-homeland-security-bill,"Just days after an internal revolt endangered passage of a border aid bill, House Democrats are set to replay the fight over the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill.

But their victory was short-lived.

Democratic moderates successfully pushed for the House to send Trump the Senate-passed bipartisan bill that did not include the provisions sought by liberals, while also including funds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency that some on the left have pushed to reform or even abolish.

With the battle over the border supplemental lost, progressives are now raising the same concerns over the DHS appropriations bill, one of two spending bills Democrats failed to pass in June.

“I think there's definitely going to be changes sought to it,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez knocks Trump for bringing Ivanka to G20 summit Repeat of border aid battle expected with Homeland Security bill Ocasio-Cortez meets Greta Thunberg for first time: 'Hope is something that you create' MORE (D-N.Y.), who fought for changes in the supplemental and voted against both the House and Senate bills.

""I would want to make sure that there isn't opportunity for abuse by ICE agents, that there are safeguards in terms of human rights and how we're treating kids, and that there are restrictions on the transfer of funding,” he said.

The battle comes as the 2020 Democratic primary season kicks into high gear with televised debates, where the question of how to deal with immigration has played a prominent role. Candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenKudlow hits Democratic candidates' economic policies: 'I don't understand what planet they're describing' Democratic debates didn't knock out frontrunners — but Kamala Harris got a big boost Repeat of border aid battle expected with Homeland Security bill MORE (D-Mass.) took turns visiting an emergency facility in Homestead, Fla., and denouncing the conditions their for migrant children.

He also said Americans should be “pissed off” following the drowning deaths of a migrant and his young daughter in the Rio Grande River.

Amid all the turmoil, some appropriators wonder whether the differences in the Democratic caucus are becoming too wide to bridge.

""I mean, you saw what happened in the border supplemental,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an appropriator on the Homeland Security subcommittee.

“There was no money for detention beds, there was no money for deportation, but people were afraid anytime they saw the word ICE,"" he said, referring to the position of progressives who remained dissatisfied with the bill.

On the other hand, Cuellar argued, moderates and red state Democrats did not want to seem soft on immigration, which could hurt their reelection chances.

Democrats would have an easier time passing the bill alongside other must-pass spending bills, Cuellar said, citing the strategy used to pass the Defense spending bill in the same group as the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill.

“My understanding is it's going to be difficult to go by itself. Not impossible, but difficult,” Cuellar said. “Because, you know, there's some extreme positions, so the best way is to pass it is to put it as part of a package.”

But Democrats have already passed 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, leaving only the largely non-controversial Legislative Branch bill as a possible partner. That measure was separated from an earlier package when controversy erupted over whether to increase congressional pay.

One potential option would be to tie the DHS bill to the defense authorization, but it’s unusual to pair spending bills with authorizing measures.

As of now, Democrats have no plans to put the DHS bill on the floor, according to a Democratic aide, but they are intent to keep trying to win over the caucus.

""We're certainly working to make sure that the whole caucus, as we always do, recognizes it's a good bill,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz Deborah (Debbie) Wasserman SchultzRepeat of border aid battle expected with Homeland Security bill Lee Zeldin responds to Ilhan Omar accusing him of 'bigotry' Congressional Women's Softball team releases roster MORE (D-Fla.), an appropriator.

Unlike the border supplemental, however, Democrats do not yet have to worry about their bill being overshadowed by a Senate compromise. The Senate has not introduced a single appropriations bill for fiscal year 2020.

But when it does, the DHS measure is sure to become a serious point of contention. In December, disagreements over that bill, and President Trump’s requested border wall funding, led to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the country’s history."
"DOJ probe expands beyond Boeing 737 MAX, includes 787 Dreamliner",https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Steve Miletich', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/federal-prosecutors-issue-subpoena-for-boeing-787-dreamliner-records/,"Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed records from Boeing relating to the production of the 787 Dreamliner in South Carolina, where there have been allegations of shoddy work, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.

The subpoena was issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the sources said. DOJ is also conducting a criminal investigation into the certification and design of the 737 MAX after two deadly crashes of that jetliner.

The 787 subpoena significantly widens the scope of the DOJ’s scrutiny of safety issues at Boeing.

The two sources who revealed the subpoena spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the inquiries.

A third source said a handful of subpoenas were issued in early June to individual employees at Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner production plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.

DOJ spokesman Peter Carr, in Washington, D.C., declined to comment Friday. A Boeing spokesman said, “We don’t comment on legal matters.”

It wasn’t clear if the subpoena served on the company was issued by the same prosecutors overseeing the 737 MAX investigation. But the third source, also speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the inquiries, said the subpoenas to employees at the South Carolina plant came from the “same group” of prosecutors involved in the 737 MAX investigation, including DOJ trial attorneys Cory Jacobs and Carol Sipperly in the Fraud Section.

Boeing divides its Dreamliner production between the South Carolina assembly plant, which rolled out its first plane in 2012, and the sprawling Everett facility where it has built jets for decades. The 737 MAX is built in Renton.

Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have been looking into the development of the 737 MAX, including a new flight-safety control system known as MCAS, after one crash on Oct. 29 off Indonesia and another in Ethiopia on March 10. Those disasters killed 346 people and led to worldwide grounding of the plane.

The grand-jury investigation into the MAX has been cloaked in secrecy, but some of the Justice Department’s activities have become known as prosecutors issued subpoenas for documents. The Department of Transportation’s Inspector General and the FBI are working with the DOJ.

A Seattle Times story in March detailed how Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) managers pushed its engineers to delegate more of the certification process for the 737 MAX to Boeing itself. The Times story also detailed flaws in an original safety analysis that Boeing delivered to the FAA.

Allegations relating to the 787 Dreamliner have centered on shoddy work and cutting corners at the company’s South Carolina plant.

While there are differences in the 737 and 787 matters, prosecutors are likely looking into whether broad cultural problems run throughout the company, according to the third source and a person in South Carolina, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter.

That could include pressure to sign off on faulty work to avoid delays in delivering planes to customers, the source said.

The New York Times reported in April that the North Charleston plant has been plagued by production issues and weak oversight that threatened to compromise safety.

Production ran years behind schedule, due to manufacturing and supplier problems, before the plane entered service in 2011.

The newspaper, citing a review of hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, as well as interviews with current and former employees, described a culture that often valued production speed over quality. Confronting manufacturing delays at the plant, Boeing pushed its workforce to quickly turn out Dreamliners, at times ignoring issues raised by employees, the newspaper reported.

The Dreamliner, introduced in 2007 and billed as Boeing’s most important new plane in a generation, featured lightweight carbon-fiber fuselage and advanced technology.

Initially assembled just in Everett, it was popular with airlines, prompting Boeing to break ground on a second Dreamliner plant in 2009 in South Carolina, which has the lowest percentage of union members of any state in the country.

Last year the Everett plant produced 55% of the 145 Dreamliners that Boeing delivered, while the South Carolina factory delivered the rest. The biggest 787, the -10 model, is assembled only in South Carolina.

The entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 after two battery-overheating incidents: a battery fire on an empty 787 parked at the gate at Boston airport, then a smoldering battery on a flight in Japan that forced an emergency landing. The FAA lifted the grounding in April 2013 after Boeing modified the jets with beefed-up batteries, containment boxes and venting tubes.

In the 737 MAX investigation, prosecutors appear to be getting information from someone with inside knowledge of the plane’s development based on the questions they are asking, the third source said.

That investigation was opened after the first crash, a highly unusual step for prosecutors after one crash, prompting speculation that someone had come forward with information, the source said.

Still, prosecutors appear to be trying to figure out whether a crime occurred, given the general scope of their questions, the source said.

Prosecutors will be looking for any evidence of the “hallmarks of classic fraud” — misrepresentation to federal regulators and customers, one of the sources said, comparing the investigation to the Justice Department’s probe of Volkswagen that led to criminal charges in an emissions scandal.

In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three criminal felony counts and agreed to pay a $2.8 billion criminal penalty as a result of the company’s scheme to sell diesel vehicles in the U.S. by cheating on emissions tests mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.

Boeing has not been charged with any crime related to the 737 crashes or the 787 production."
DHS acting chief predicts up to 25 percent drop in border crossings after new Mexico agreement,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-25-percent-drop-in-border-numbers-after-agreement-with-mexico,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security on Friday said that he expects the number of migrants apprehended at the border will be lower by up to 25 percent in June than in previous months after Mexico increased its enforcement measures.

“It’s become clear that over the past three weeks since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico that we’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border, and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,” Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters.

DEMS RUN LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: DEBATE FEATURES VOWS OF HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED, DEPORTATION CURBS

The U.S. and Mexico reached agreement this month on a deal that sees Mexico take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration” in exchange for the U.S. dropping proposed sanctions on Mexican imports.

McAleenan said the U.S. was looking to see Mexico increase its deployment of National Guard members to the border, and for the expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which allow for illegal immigrants to be returned to Mexico while their immigration proceedings are held.

""These initiatives are making an impact and we are now anticipating a significant reduction in border crossing numbers from June, as much as 25 percent when compared to the record level in May,” he said.

NEW LEADERS INSTALLED AT TOP IMMIGRATION AGENCIES AMID QUESTIONS OVER DHS SECRETARY'S FUTURE

Customs and Border Protection said that it encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. NBC News reports that in 2018 there was a 17 percent decrease from May to June.

McAleenan also said the U.S. is working with Northern Triangle countries to deal with root causes of the migration crisis and increase efforts to tackle organized smuggling organizations in the region.

His remarks come a day after the House passed the Senate version of a $4.5 humanitarian aid bill. It passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed down from a push to include restrictions on immigration enforcement that could have scuttled the measure. Trump is expected to sign the bill early next week.

McAleenan thanked congressional leaders for getting the bill passed, and said that while it didn’t include everything DHS wanted in it -- specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds for single adults -- it “substantially addresses” the request for funding.

He also took issue with media reports that children at detention centers were not being given vital supplies while in detention, leading to an outcry from lawmakers on Capitol Hill about alleged conditions at the centers. He said that while he has testified for months about concerns over the ability of DHS to handle the vast number of migrants crossing the border, those calls received little attention. But he said that some reports were ""missing the story.""

""Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,"" McAleenan said."
Donald Trump just became the first sitting president to set foot in North Korea,https://www.salon.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/30/donald-trump-just-became-the-first-president-to-set-foot-in-north-korea/,"On Sunday President Donald Trump became the first sitting president to set foot in North Korea — and, before he completed his meeting with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, made it clear that he plans on resuming talks with that country.

At 3:46 PM according to local time, Trump crossed a low concrete marker and walked 20 steps to the base of a building on North Korean soil to meet Kim for an encounter that was broadcast on televisions throughout the world, according to The New York Times. He walked 20 steps in order to do so and in the process broke a longstanding precedent in which sitting American presidents did not set foot on North Korean soil.

""It is good to see you again. I never expected to meet you in this place,"" Kim told Trump through his interpreter. The president replied, ""Big moment, big moment.""

After briefly talking with each other and reporters, the two men retreated into Freedom House in the community of Panmunjom, informally known as the ""truce village"" because of its proximity to the border between the two nations and because it is where the American-led United Nations forces signed a peace treaty with the Chinese-led North Korean forces to end the Korean War in 1953.

During their interactions with reporters, Kim said that Trump's setting foot on North Korean soil and meeting with him ""has a lot of significance because it means that we want to bring an end to the unpleasant past and try to create a new future, so it’s a very courageous and determined act.""

Trump added that ""stepping across that line was a great honor. A lot of progress has been made, a lot of friendships have been made and this has been in particular a great friendship."" The two men agreed that there would be future talks between them.

Speaking with Salon earlier this year, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed concern that Kim would take advantage of Trump.

""Well let me say, every administration that I’ve read about since the end of World War II has had a very difficult relationship with North Korea,"" Albright told Salon. ""There’s no question about it. And then also since the Korean War — for which we do not have a peace treaty — there are issues where we have had not relationships with North Korea, and we have no embassy in North Korea. We do know that they have a nuclear capability and missiles. So those are the problems.""

She added, ""I do think that many administrations — including the one that I was in, and I was the highest-level sitting official to have met with the North Koreans until the present administration — is that they are not easy to deal with, and they are threatening, so I am concerned about the following things: First of all, at the beginning of the Trump administration, there was a lot of 'fire and fury' talk and threats and things like that, which I thought were counterproductive. I do believe in diplomacy. But I also do believe in prepared diplomacy. I was asked whether the Singapore summit was a win-win or a 'Kim win.' It was a 'Kim win' because the President canceled some exercises that we have with our allies, the Japanese and the South Koreans, and it’s unclear to me what the North Koreans gave or what it is that they put up to this, especially since they have not agreed to any kind of way of an inventory or international way of figuring out what they have and what denuclearization — which is what we are trying to get — what is the measurement of that, what’s going on."""
Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."
Feds announce millions in emergency funds to fight violence in rural Alaska,https://www.ktuu.com,['Melinda Bolton'],,,,https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/DOJ-announces-millions-in-emergency-funds-to-fight-violence-in-rural-Alaska-511957802.html,"The United States Attorney General has announced more than $10 million in emergency funding to help improve what he calls a public safety crisis in rural Alaska. The funding was outlined in a memo released by the Department of Justice Friday morning to address what William Barr calls, “an unacceptable, daily reality for Alaska Native people.”

Immediately, $6 million will be available to the state for law enforcement in Alaska Native villages. That will help pay for more Village Public Safety Officers, Village Police Officers, Tribal Police officers, and help to fund mobile jails.

Another $4.5 million will be funded in grants by the end of July. That will come from the Department's Office on Community Oriented Policing Services and will fund the wages and training for 20 officer positions for Alaska Native groups.

To address the need for children’s advocacy centers, the Office on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention will get some funding to help support those centers in Alaska’s rural hubs, including for services like forensic interviews and medical exams for young victims of domestic and sexual violence. Those finances will be part of $14 million the two offices have allocated to be shared between Alaska and the Lower 48.

Meanwhile, the DoJ says a Rural Alaska Violent Crime Reduction working group will be led by U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder to identify more ways to strengthen the presence and effectiveness of tribal, state and federal law enforcement in the rural areas. The memo says that group will focus especially on domestic violence and crimes against children. Those efforts will also be bolstered with another $162,000 in funds to begin a Project Safe Neighborhoods target site covering rural Alaska.

The Department of Justice also shared some issues it plans to tackle in the near future:

• Providing training to equip staff to tend to female victims of sexual assault, and implement community training.

• An application extension for Crime Victim Funding for direct services including advocacy, shelters, child and elderly victims

• An application extension for programs that assist with mental health and substance abuse, including crime reduction and re-entry

• The availability of two programs, especially with Alaska in mind; the Anti-Methamphetamine Program and the Anti-Heroin Task Force

The U.S. Attorney General said in the memo, “With this emergency declaration, I am directing resources where they are needed most and needed immediately, to support the local law enforcement response in Alaska Native communities, whose people are dealing with extremely high rates of violence.”

Barr is also calling on each component of the Department to submit its plans within the month that will further support these efforts' success.

The announcement follows a visit Barr made a month ago to Alaska which included meetings with tribal and state leaders in Anchorage and to places off the road system like Bethel and Galena.

Barr says he plans to travel to other locations in Indian country in the Lower 48, as he noted that the issues seen in Alaska are pervasive in those indigenous communities as well.

Acting Homeland Security chief denies leaking info on ICE raids: 'It's just not true',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Victor Garcia', 'Kevin Mcaleenan', 'Acting Dhs Secretary']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-head-denies-he-leaked-ice-raid-info-says-dems-decriminalizing-border-crossings-would-add-to-the-problem,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday night denied leaking information that eventually led to the cancellation of ICE raids in 10 cities across America.

""I would not, have not, ever leaked details of a sensitive law enforcement operation,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""My primary responsibility,"" he added, ""is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

""My primary responsibility is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true."" — Kevin McAleenan, acting DHS secretary

McAleenan was accused last week of leaking plans for raids scheduled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a unit of the DHS, after supposedly expressing fierce opposition to the plan and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

The source also said Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

McAleenan also denied that anyone in his office leaked the information after host Laura Ingraham pressed further, saying that as the operation date nears ""you have to push information out into the field.""

""So tonight you're saying these rumors are wrong false and you did not do that?"" Ingraham asked.

""Absolutely not,"" McAleenan responded.

The acting secretary also commented on the Democratic presidential candidates advocating for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, saying it would ""further undermine our efforts at the border"" and increase the numbers of those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Decriminalizing crossing between ports of entry when we know it's associated with criminal smugglers ... when they know they bring drugs behind those people that are crossing, it would just add to the problem,"" McAleenan said.

Local farmers react to USDA corn survey,https://www.kcrg.com,['Brian Tabick'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Local-farmers-react-to-USDA-corn-survey-512012511.html,"A recent crop survey released by the United States Department of Agriculture shows more corn has been planted this year than in 2018 but some farmers say that information isn’t reliable at this point.

Farmers are still playing catch up after a late start because of snow later in the season and heavy rains.

This week the USDA released a survey saying farmers had planted over 91 million acres of corn this year. That is higher than last year’s 89 million acres, but farmers say those numbers don’t tell the whole story.

“What went wrong with the survey,” asked longtime farmer Denny Sejkora of Marion.

Sejkora says you need to really read the fine print to understand where the data was collected.

“Out of that surveyed acreages they reported only 83 million had planted and there were another 15 million acres that were intended to be planted,” he said, “They may or may not have planted corn.”

The old saying ‘knee high by the 4th of July’ hasn’t been relevant in a long time; farmers say they would like to see their crop around shoulder height this time of year.

“Corn is a lot further behind than we’re used to,” said Nate Hofmann of Marion. “We are used to seeing tassels by the 4th and we just aren’t going to see that this year.”

When the USDA released those numbers corn prices went down. Lucky for Sejkora, he made some changes before prices dropped. Hofmann, on the other hand, wasn’t so lucky.

“Unfortunately, I have a little left to sell,” he said. “I was gonna ride the wave a little longer.”

The USDA says they will conduct another survey this month and put those results out in August."
Tillerson Says Kushner Bypassed Him and Mattis to Make Foreign Policy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Sharon Lafraniere']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/rex-tillerson-trump.html,"Mr. Tillerson said he did.

A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said Thursday night that “Jared consistently follows proper protocols” with the National Security Council and State Department. He said the “alleged ‘dinner’ to supposedly discuss the blockade never happened,” and no one in the White House was “involved in the blockade.” (A transcript of the interview with Mr. Tillerson described the Riyadh meeting as a dinner.) He added that Mr. Kushner’s work with Mexico had led to positive results on trade and other issues.

The New York Times and several other news organizations obtained a copy of the committee’s interview transcript before its release on Thursday afternoon. Parts had been redacted at the request of Mr. Tillerson and the State Department.

Mr. Tillerson became secretary of state in February 2017, after being asked to meet with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and two other aides, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, in Trump Tower. But Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump subsequently clashed over policy, the president’s management style and his intellectual capacity — Mr. Tillerson is said to have once called Mr. Trump a “moron” to other officials — before Mr. Tillerson was fired in March 2018.

Mr. Tillerson also alienated State Department officials and career employees because he tried to cut the budget, left important posts open and, in their eyes, remained aloof — all of which he was asked about in the committee interview.

The most telling anecdotes show Mr. Kushner and, to a degree, Mr. Bannon, making foreign policy in the shadows.

Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that in the weeks leading up to a presidential summit in Riyadh in May 2017, Saudi officials did not give him any indication of their deepening political disputes with Qatar and their aim to join with the Emiratis and other Arab nations to impose a blockade.

One night around May 20, Saudi and Emirati leaders met with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon over dinner and told the Americans of their plans for the blockade, a Democratic counsel said during the committee interview. Mr. Tillerson said he had not heard of the dinner until the committee interview."

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced USD49.3 million in funding for nuclear energy research, facility access, crosscutting technology development, and infrastructure for 58 advanced nuclear technology projects in 25 states.

The NEUP was created in 2009 to consolidate the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy's university support under one programme (Image: NEUP)

The awards include USD25.8 million for some 40 university-led research and development projects plus USD1.6 million for seven university-led research reactor and infrastructure improvements under the Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP).

Five research and development projects led by DOE national laboratories and US universities will receive a total of USD4.5 million in funding to conduct research to address ""crosscutting nuclear energy challenges"" that will help to develop advanced sensors and instrumentation, advanced manufacturing methods, and materials for multiple nuclear reactor plant and fuel applications. These include a project led by Los Alamos National Laboratory to determine the feasibility of laser additive manufacturing for producing reactor components of a ferritic/martensitic steel with an engineered microstructure, which is earmarked for an estimated USD1 million of funding.

Two university-, one national laboratory- and three industry-led projects to investigate important nuclear fuel and material applications will receive support under the Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF) programme. DOE will support three of these projects a total of USD1.5 million in research funds, while supporting all six by more than USD10 million in facility access costs and expertise for experimental neutron and ion irradiation testing, post-irradiation examination facilities, synchrotron beamline capabilities, and technical assistance for design and analysis of experiments. Two of the NEUP projects will also be supported with USD3 million in NSUF access funds.

""DOE is looking to the future, and that's why we are investing in advanced nuclear technologies. Nuclear energy is a critical part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, and early-stage research can help ensure it will continue to be a clean, reliable, and resilient source of electricity for a long time to come,"" said DOE Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Ed McGinnis said.

The DOE Office of Nuclear Energy has now awarded more than USD678 million through its university programmes since 2009, the department said.

There were surprising numbers in the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS) acreage estimates for corn and soybeans released Friday.

Corn-planted area for all purposes in 2019 is estimated at 91.7 million, a 3% increase from last year. Soybean-planted area is estimated at 80 million acres, down 10% from last year.

However, the average estimate from industry analysts in advance for U.S. corn was 86.66 million, which is significantly lower than the survey's figures. Those estimates took into consideration the rain and flooding that has affected U.S. farmers this year.

For soybeans, the industry analysts' average estimate was 84.36, a higher estimate than the survey's data for soybeans.

“There’s a difference of opinion on what reality is,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “The USDA just put out their opinion, but that’s not the opinion a lot of others have.”

It’s also inconsistent from previous USDA estimates, although this USDA/NASS survey is separate and independent from the USDA’s own May and June estimates. The USDA estimated corn planted acreage at 92.8 and then 89.8 in May and June, respectively.

For soybean planted acreage, the USDA in both May and June estimated 84.6 million acres.

For comparison, in 2018 there were 89.1 million acres of corn planted and 89.2 million acres of soybean planted.

"VA ordered fake appointments to cut waiting list, whistleblower says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-va-ordered-fake-appointments-to-cut-waiting-list/2019/06/26/97e50648-9856-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Columnist

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans’ Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges such as these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve-racking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

Whistleblower exposes $7 billion no-bid Defense Department contract,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/halliburton-whistleblower-on-exposing-7-billion-no-bid-defense-contract-2019-06-30/,"Last decade, when American was embroiled in the Iraq War, a high-ranking U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put her career on the line to stand up to some of the most powerful men in America. She believed that a major corporation had been benefiting from a collection of well-connected contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.

Although she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. ""My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,"" she addressed the committee.

Bunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,"" she told ""Whistleblower"" host Alex Ferrer in ""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.""

KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton. In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.

""What was the size of this contract?"" Ferrer asked.

""Seven billion dollars,"" she replied.

What Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.

""A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,"" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. ""So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.""

A spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.

A representative for KBR said ""it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.""

For Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. ""I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,"" she told the Senate committee.

A 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.

""Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,"" Ferrer commented.

""I felt that I was physically being threatened,"" Greenhouse replied. ""They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,"" she added.

Born and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.

In 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Greenhouse started to notice a ""good ole boys club"" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt. General Ballard, retired in 2000. Then, in the weeks leading up to the Iraq War in 2003, she attended a top-secret meeting at the Pentagon to discuss details of the Restore Iraqi Oil contract. Present in the room were representatives of Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, Cheney's former employer.

Greenhouse was concerned about awarding KBR with the no-bid, 5-year contract and urged to accept other bids and limit the duration of the deal. But her objections were never addressed, and KBR received the contract. Later, it was revealed in a draft audit that the company had overcharged the government for fuel purchases by $61 million. She ultimately testified in front of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.

Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the Army Corp and she was incredibly good at her job. Because the top brass at USACE couldn't actually fire her, which was a perk of having a high station in the government, they demoted her. When this happened, she was stripped of her security clearance and sent off to a remote cubicle somewhere; she was basically condemned to oblivion. After she filed her whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire placed around her cubicle and she fell, permanently damaging her knee.

The Defense Authorization Act Of 2009 reformed some of the very contracting practices that Greenhouse had objected to five years earlier and it limited the duration of certain no-bid contracts.

Greenhouse filed a mixed case lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers. The whistleblower case claimed that Greenhouse had been retaliated against for speaking out and had faced discrimination based on race, age, and gender.

USDA reports large U.S. soybean sale to China ahead of Trump-Xi meeting,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karl Plume', 'Min Read']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-soybeans/usda-reports-large-us-soybean-sale-to-china-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting-idUSKCN1TT2ET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday reported a large soybean sale to China, an apparent goodwill gesture a day before the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven months.

The trade war has curbed exports of U.S. crops to China and looms over the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Japan. Expectations have dimmed that the world’s two biggest economies can ease tensions when Trump and Xi meet in Osaka on Saturday.

The USDA said Chinese importers bought 544,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year which expires Aug. 31. It was the largest U.S. soybean sale to China since late March, USDA data showed.

The USDA said in a statement the sale was new and not a change of destination of a previously announced sale.

The deal surprised some traders as soybean export premiums for late-summer shipments were unchanged this week, showing little evidence that a large purchase was occurring, and because recent large purchases have come only after talks between the two countries.

A sharp drop in China’s hog herd, which consumes most of the soybeans processed by the world’s largest pork market, due to a deadly hog disease called African swine fever has also reduced demand for the oilseed.

“To me it looks like a good faith purchase, which we’ve seen before, although in the past they came after the two presidents shook hands. Today it’s coming before they do so it may be trying to influence talks,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone.

“All this comes against a backdrop of China having ample supplies of soybeans and talk of them delaying shipment of July beans into August because of the big supplies,” he said.

Beijing had agreed to buy nearly 14 million tonnes from American farmers over December to March during a temporary truce in the trade spat.

More than 8 million tonnes of those have already been shipped to China, but about 6 million tonnes, including Friday’s sale, still need to be delivered.

Trump said on Friday he hopes for productive talks but made no promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs that have cast a shadow on global growth.

U.S. soybean exports to China have plunged by more than 80 percent since Beijing slapped steep tariffs on shipments last July. China, the world’s top soybean importer, is on pace for its smallest U.S. soybean imports in 11 years as importers there have increased purchases from South America, mainly from top exporter Brazil."
House Dems Stiff-Arm DHS on Domestic Terror Funds,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'National Security Reporter', 'Political Reporter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-dems-stiff-arm-dhs-on-domestic-terror-funds,"As white supremacist terror attacks have left dozens dead around the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has faced blistering criticism for its approach to the threat. Earlier this year, however, congressional Democrats declined to make more money available for the department’s efforts to thwart domestic terrorist attacks.

Their reason, in part: concern the Trump administration could use new money to target American Muslims instead of white supremacists.

It’s a complex episode of a messy fight between Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives—a fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake. And it didn’t have to happen.

When Trump came into office, his Office of Management and Budget didn’t ask Congress for money for a small grant program DHS used to fund efforts to counter domestic terrorism. A source familiar with the department’s efforts said there were concerns that some of the grants provided by DHS at the end of the Obama administration to help prevent attacks by homegrown violent extremists were inefficient and failed to address the threats adequately.

After two years without funding, DHS officials decided to go straight to congressional appropriators to request the money instead of going through the White House. Per one congressional source familiar with the request, they asked for more than $17 million—$10 million to offset the grant money that existed under the Obama administration, plus about $7 million more. They made the ask in recent weeks.

But House appropriators didn’t bite, and declined to include that money in a recent funding bill. They worried, according to half a dozen sources familiar with the talks, that DHS doesn’t have a cohesive strategy for fighting domestic terror—a concern a DHS official said is unwarranted. And the White House has yet to release a clear strategy document on the growing threat, instead just having officials characterize it in speeches and congressional testimony. Four of those sources specifically said that concerns about potential anti-Muslim programs informed Democrats’ reticence to provide the new funds.

And the request’s timing didn’t help. One Democratic aide said the committee had already written a bill funding the department for 2020 by the time the request came in. DHS submitted its request in the spring, the aide said.

“The department requested funding for these grants under the Obama administration, but there was a [concern] that under Trump [the grants] would be used in the new administration to fuel anti-Muslim programming and rhetoric,” a House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast.

“ The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants... But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. ” — former DHS official John Cohen

A DHS official strongly disagreed with this characterization. “DHS is committed to protecting the homeland by working to prevent all types of violent extremism,” this official told The Daily Beast. “The department rejects the premise that its prevention programs have or would target Muslims.”

In testimony in front of Congress in June, Elizabeth Neumann, the assistant secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy, the division that oversees programs to prevent domestic terrorist attacks, said the tactics used by homegrown violent extremists make it “extremely difficult for law enforcement to detect and thwart potential attacks.”

The DHS request came as the Trump administration began to push a new strategy regarding security at the southern border. Over the past year, the White House and DHS have pushed for more resources to try to slow an influx of Central American migrants.

In May, the White House requested $4.5 billion in emergency border funding from Congress, more than $3 billion of which would go to humanitarian efforts. President Trump reportedly requested the additional funding for the border because the money the administration previously received from the Department of Defense came with several restrictions and limitations. The House voted Tuesday to approve the supplemental funding.

And over the weekend, Trump postponed nationwide raids to deport undocumented families after threatening to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out on the streets if Democrats on Capitol Hill did not agree to changes in asylum law.

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has drawn criticism for its handling of election security and domestic terrorism issues. The Daily Beast reported the department this year shuttered a group within its intelligence arm focused on analysis of domestic terrorism. It also gutted two task forces focused on election security and foreign interference.

On top of that, headquarters has asked each Homeland Security component to send volunteers away from their day jobs and to the border. The department’s agency responsible for protecting America’s vital infrastructure—including election systems—struggled to initially fulfill the request and had to send out more than one request for volunteers. Democrats and other outside observers say the White House’s decision to prioritize border security over other core DHS missions leaves the country at risk.

“The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants and others outside of this country,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “ But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. So, any effort to protect this nation has to focus on the domestic environment as opposed to being obsessed by that potential violence that feeds the administration’s anti-immigration agenda.”"
The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R. Segal'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/doj-noel-francisco-lies-census-case-supreme-court-defender-general.html,"Noel Francisco attends his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in D.C. on May 10, 2017. Mark Wilson/Getty Images

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind. And if the defender general can’t protect the rule of law, then maybe, by publicly confronting the failure of DOJ lawyering, she can avenge it.

Both presidents struck a diplomatic tone in their remarks.

Trump said his meeting with Xi was ""excellent ... as good as it was going to be.""

He made the brief remarks seated next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a quick media spray.

""We discussed a lot of things and we're right back on track and we'll see what happens, but we had a really good meeting,"" Trump said. ""I think President Xi will be putting out a statement ... and we will too.""

He added: ""We had a very, very good meeting with China, I would say probably even better than expected. The negotiations are continuing. ... We're doing very well.""

Trump was complimentary of Xi in brief remarks before the private meeting, saying, ""We've become friends,"" and recalling his trip to Beijing in November 2017 as ""one of the most incredible of my life.""

""I look forward to working with you,"" Trump said. ""We've had an excellent relationship but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade.""

The president said it would be historic if the two sides could reach a fair trade deal and expressed optimism that the meeting would bring a positive result.

""I think this can be a very productive meeting and I think we can go on to do something that will be monumental and great for both countries and that's what I look forward to doing,"" Trump said.

Xi began his comments by harking back to the days of so-called ping-pong diplomacy that began a process of normalizing relations between the two sides.

""The small ball played a big role in moving world events,"" Xi said.

""Enormous change has taken place in the international situation and U.S.-China relations, but one basic fact remains unchanged: China-U.S. relations benefit from cooperation and lose in confrontation,"" Xi said.

""Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation,"" Xi continued, and then referenced his recent exchange of calls and letters with Trump and said he looks forward to the meeting to forge a way toward cooperation.

Trump did not take any questions about whether they would be discussing the controversy surrounding Chinese telecom giant Huawei or whether the U.S. and China are close to a trade deal."

The future of their nominations now remain on hold, ""until the inhumane and substandard conditions for children at DHS processing and detention facilities improve significantly,"" Rosen said in a statement.

""I will maintain these holds until a nongovernmental third party certifies that DHS has complied. I will use all tools available to hold this Administration accountable for their treatment of vulnerable children and families,"" she added.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Soybeans were higher while grains were lower in overnight trading ahead of key reports from the USDA due today.

The government will release its Acreage and Grain Stocks Report at noon in Washington.

Analysts have pegged corn acres at about 86.7 million, down from a government estimate of 89.8 million earlier this month, and soybean area at 84.4 million, down slightly from the 84.6 million estimated in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, according to research Allendale.

All wheat area is pegged at 45.7 million acres, down marginally from the 45.8 million estimated earlier this month.

Analysts polled by Reuters have pegged corn stockpiles on June 1 at 5.33 billion bushels, up from 5.31 billion bushels a year earlier, and soybean inventories at 1.861 billion bushels, up considerably from the 1.22 billion in storage last year.

Wheat stocks at the start of the month are expected to be reported at 1.1 billion bushels, unchanged from the year-earlier level, Reuters said.

Soybeans for November delivery rose 1½¢ to $9.13¾ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal fell 30¢ to $312.90 a short ton, while soy oil added 0.03¢ to 27.96¢ a pound.

Corn futures for May delivery were down 1½¢ to $4.44¼ a bushel overnight.

3. Heat Warnings Issued in Parts of Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska

From excessive rainfall to weather that’s too hot, parts of the Midwest can’t seem to catch any normal weather this year.

A heat advisory has been issued for much of northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri, as temperatures are expected to climb into the mid-90s, which will push heat index values as high as 105˚F., according to the National Weather Service.

The area has seen major flooding for the past several weeks after excessive rainfall pushed the Missouri River and its tributaries over their banks. Flood warnings are still in effect for the region.

It’s not just the heat; another round of thunderstorms is possible in northern Missouri tonight. Small hail and gusty winds are expected.

Citing administration officials, the Times reported that Mnuchin has been lobbying President Donald Trump, who has signaled that he supports the idea of handing control of the agency back to Treasury.

Mnuchin held talks this month about the move with senior Secret Service agents at the Treasury Department, the Times reported.

Mnuchin has been interested in the agency's cybersecurity and anticounterfeiting work, according to the Times.

Some senior DHS officials oppose the move, concerned about losing an agency with those components, the Times reports.

Bill Wehrum is leaving his post as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Bill Wehrum spent only a year and a half as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top air official before announcing plans to resign Wednesday amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

But during that time, Wehrum served as one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the ambition and reach of the EPA, and to retreat from President Obama’s push to slash emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. He oversaw efforts to ease regulation of the coal industry, slow requirements that cars and trucks become more fuel efficient and overhaul how the agency calculates costs and benefits to favor industry.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back air pollution rules. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for “his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.”

Environmental groups, Democrats on Capitol Hill and other critics were quick to celebrate Wehrum’s departure, calling him an integral part of the “swamp” that President Trump had vowed to drain in Washington.

“William Wehrum was emblematic of the administration’s struggles to remain ethical,"" Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. ""While it’s a good thing that Wehrum’s potential ethics problems will no longer affect the agency, the tone is set at the top, and if the EPA is to clean up the mess started by Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration needs to get serious about policing its ethical failures.”

Wehrum, who was confirmed in November 2017, is the latest Trump appointee to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members — EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin — have all left under an ethics cloud, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General is currently investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties — a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,” Wehrum said, “because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.”

Still, the fallout from the disclosure about Wehrum’s ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets — including Politico, the New York Times and E&E News — has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a collection of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded earlier this year.

Wehrum has said he represented the group as its own entity, rather than the individual utilities that made up its membership. But investigators on Capitol Hill have explored whether he and his former firm represented the power companies as well, according to one person familiar with the inquiry, raising the prospect that Werhum’s meetings could have violated ethics rules on multiple counts. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.

Both Wehrum’s supporters and his critics say that he has accomplished some of industry’s long-sought goals. In doing so, he has rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s most sweeping air policies. Last week the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other controversial proposals as well, including one that would slow efforts to improve gas mileage for cars and light trucks. Another would limit how the EPA calculates public health benefits in proposed regulations, which could make it tougher to limit pollution sources.

“No assistant administrator at EPA had more on their plate than Bill,"" Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""He executed the job with a steady hand and got big things done.”

But what some industry officials saw as Wehrum’s reasonable measures to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, critics describe as undermining the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

“It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the Sierra Club.

In a phone interview, Coequyt said that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback for enlisting Wehrum’s help. “We believe he’s toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA’s inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump’s EPA.

“I can’t wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he’s out the door,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “What do you bet it’s with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?”"
The FTC’s Qualcomm Case Reveals Concerning Divide with DOJ on Patent Hold-Up,https://www.ipwatchdog.com,['The Author'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/06/28/ftcs-qualcomm-case-reveals-concerning-divide-doj-patent-hold/id=110764/,"“For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty.”

On May 2, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of submitting a Statement of Interest in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) case against Qualcomm to take a position contrary to the FTC. The DOJ argued that “[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests.” In response, the FTC informed the court that it “did not participate in or request” the DOJ’s filing, that it “disagree[d] with a number of contentions” made by the DOJ, and that the DOJ “misconstrues applicable law and the record.” In the end, the court agreed with the FTC and issued injunctive relief against Qualcomm without conducting the further remedy proceedings the DOJ advocated.

Underscoring the Divide

The public feuding between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies about how to resolve a case litigated by one them was a remarkable spectacle. It also brought into focus a broader divide between the FTC and DOJ on the role of antitrust law in addressing patents that are essential to industry standards (SEPs) and subject to commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

Since being confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017, Makan Delrahim has shifted the DOJ’s longstanding focus on the risks of patent hold-up—where SEP owners take advantage of large investments by companies to develop products using a standard to extract unreasonable, non-FRAND licensing terms—to address what he views as the greater risk of patent hold-out—which he defines as potential licensees colluding on issues such as licensing terms for SEPs. In a March 16, 2018 speech, Delrahim said that “hold-up is fundamentally not an antitrust problem, and therefore antitrust law should not be used as a tool to police FRAND commitments that patent-holders make to standard setting organizations” and offered his view that “implementer hold-out poses a more serious threat to innovation than innovator hold-up.”

Joseph Simons, the FTC Chairman, addressed this divide in a September 25, 2018 speech. While he noted that “[c]onsistency across the two federal enforcement agencies is . . . beneficial,” he observed that treatment of SEPs may be an area for “some potential inconsistency” between the agencies. He elaborated that “we agree with the Division that hold-out in the standard-setting process can raise serious concerns under antitrust law when such hold-out is the result of collusion among potential adopters/licensees. But we also believe that hold-up raises potential antitrust issues, as well.” Simons committed that the FTC “will continue our economically grounded and fact-based enforcement of the antitrust laws in this area.” Consistent with that approach, the FTC contended in a December 2018 filing in the Qualcomm case that “Qualcomm’s refusal to make SEP licenses available to competitors in breach of its voluntary commitments to standard-setting organizations is anticompetitive conduct.”

Although the DOJ submission in the Qualcomm case did not take a position on the merits, it appears to have been motivated by, and is consistent with, Delrahim’s efforts to downplay the potential for harm from patent hold-up. (Delrahim, who lobbied for Qualcomm, is reportedly recused from matters involving Qualcomm and did not sign the DOJ’s Qualcomm filing.) The DOJ filing highlighted the divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this important issue. It was not always so. For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty regarding what had been a consensus area of concern for the agencies.

The Roles of the DOJ and FTC

Before turning to how the DOJ and FTC have previously addressed patent hold-up, it is worth briefly examining the dual roles of the DOJ and FTC in enforcing the antitrust laws.

Among other statutes, the DOJ Antitrust Division is charged with criminal and civil enforcement under the Sherman Act and civil enforcement under the Clayton Act. The DOJ also provides guidance on the application of antitrust laws, including by issuing business review letters advising on how it may respond to particular proposed joint ventures or other business conduct.

The FTC was created with the passage of the FTC Act, which directs the agency to prevent “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2). As interpreted by the FTC, Section 5 of the FTC Act “encompasses not only those acts and practices that violate the Sherman or Clayton Act but also those that contravene the spirit of the antitrust laws and those that, if allowed to mature or complete, could violate the Sherman or Clayton Act.” Unlike the DOJ, the FTC does not conduct criminal enforcement.

The jurisdictions and roles of the FTC and DOJ thus overlap, including in merger reviews, investigations of anticompetitive conduct, and offering guidance on the antitrust laws. The agencies employ a “clearance” process to ensure that they do not undertake duplicative investigations that would, among other problems, subject targets to competing demands from the agencies and potentially lead to conflicting outcomes.

When it comes to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property, both agencies have oversight responsibilities and they have collaborated to issue guidance on their shared approach to enforcement. For example, in 1995, the agencies jointly issued Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property setting forth their policy on antitrust treatment of licensing intellectual property.

The DOJ and FTC Have Traditionally Agreed on the Dangers of Patent Hold-Up

Over the course of more than a decade—across both the Republican Bush Administration and the Democratic Obama Administration—the DOJ and FTC both consistently recognized that SEPs present a danger of hold-up, and that this was a proper subject for antitrust agency enforcement.

As early as 2006, the DOJ warned of the dangers of patent hold-up in a business review letter to a standard-setting organization (SSO): “Once a particular technology is chosen and the standard is developed . . . it can be extremely expensive or even impossible to substitute one technology for another. . . . Thus, those seeking to implement a given standard may be willing to license a patented technology included in the standard on more onerous terms than they would have been prior to the standard’s adoption in order to avoid the expense and delay of developing a new standard around a different technology.”

In 2007, the DOJ and FTC partnered to issue a report called Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition. The agencies described the “potential for ‘hold up’ by the owner of patented technology after its technology has been chosen by the SSO as a standard and others have incurred sunk costs which effectively increase the relative cost of switching to an alternative standard.” The agencies warned that this “power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms” could harm consumers “if those higher royalties were passed on in the form of higher prices.”

In 2013, the DOJ partnered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on a Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments. The Policy warned of the risk that SEPs could be used “to pressure an implementer of a standard to accept more onerous licensing terms than the patent holder would be entitled to receive consistent with the F/RAND commitment.” A DOJ official explained that the Statement “was informed by over a decade of thinking by the [DOJ Antitrust Division], the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the PTO about standards-setting activities and the IP policies of standard-setting organizations (SSOs).” (Delrahim announced in December 2018 that the DOJ was withdrawing its assent to the Statement.)

Beyond issuing guidance, the DOJ also accounted for patent hold-up in enforcement. In 2012, when the DOJ closed its investigation of Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and a consortium’s acquisition of Nortel Networks’ SEPs, it explained that it had “focused on whether the acquiring firms would have the incentive and ability to exploit ambiguities in the SSOs’ F/RAND licensing commitments to hold up rivals, thus preventing or inhibiting innovation and competition,” including by “seeking to prevent or exclude products from practicing those SEPs from the market altogether.”

For its part, the FTC has challenged hold-up through seven enforcement actions over two decades. Those include a 2005 consent order with Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) after the FTC accused it of monopolizing a market for low-emission gasoline by misrepresenting in state regulatory standard-setting proceedings that an approach to reducing emissions was in the public domain when Unocal was actively pursuing patents on the technology that would later allow it to charge hold-up royalties to its competitors.

A Cause for Concern

The DOJ’s turn away from its long-held position on the risks of patent hold-up is a cause for serious concern.

First, it is bad policy. In explaining the DOJ’s about-face, Delrahim has referred to a “so-called ‘hold-up’ problem in the context of SSOs” and contended that concerns with hold-up “rely on models devoid of economic or empirical evidence that hold-up is a real phenomenon.” But the DOJ’s prior recognition of the risks of patent hold-up was well supported.

U.S. courts have long recognized that SEPs pose a hold-up threat. In 2007, for example, the Third Circuit observed that “[t]o guard against anticompetitive patent hold-up, most [standards development organizations] require firms supplying essential technologies for inclusion in a prospective standard to commit to licensing their technologies on FRAND terms.” Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2007). More recently, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he development of standards . . . creates an opportunity for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior” and that “[u]sing that standard-development leverage, the SEP holders are in a position to demand more for a license than the patented technology, had it not been adopted by the SSO, would be worth.” Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“SEPs pose two potential problems that could inhibit widespread adoption of the standard: patent hold-up and royalty stacking”).

As to the economics of patent hold-up, the DOJ observed in a 2015 business review letter that the “economic bargaining model underlying claims of hold-up has been studied extensively and applied to the standard-setting context,” citing scholarship dating back decades. That conclusion echoed the views of the DOJ and FTC in their 2007 report that patent hold-up is simply a “variant of the classic ‘hold-up problem’.” The DOJ also noted in its 2015 letter that “litigated cases demonstrate the potential for hold up when owners of RAND-encumbered standards-essential patents make royalty demands significantly above the adjudicated RAND rate” and provided examples where licensors’ demands were on the order of about 170 to 230 times what courts determined were RAND rates.

Recognition of the dangers of hold-up is thus well supported as a matter of law and economics. To be sure, if competitors collude in an SSO to fix the terms on which they will license technology, antitrust enforcement would be appropriate. But simply because one can envision the possibility of an alternative form of anticompetitive conduct relating to standard setting does not mean that the DOJ should simply ignore the well-documented existence of another form of harm.

Second, the DOJ’s abrupt shift away from over a decade of guidance on hold-up creates uncertainty for the many industries that rely on standards. While the shift in policy has been cast as being motivated by a concern for fostering innovation, it threatens to have the opposite effect. Companies planning investments in standardized products now face greater uncertainty about whether they can count on established rules, particularly as articulated in the DOJ’s business review letters, to safeguard their ability to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Third, that a change in administration has led the DOJ to turn away from a long-held, bipartisan approach plays into the perception that antitrust enforcement is increasingly a political tool. While there may be higher profile examples of the politicization of antitrust enforcement, any step that suggests that a change in administration, not law and economics, will lead to wholesale departure from existing antitrust policy is troubling."

Some environmental groups raised questions about Wallace’s nearly two decades as a lobbyist for General Electric Energy and income from stock in the oil industry, but many conservation groups offered letters in support of his nomination.

The Senate also confirmed Aimee Jorjani to a post on the the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Like Wallace, Jorjani received words of praise from Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee

Her husband, Daniel Jorjani, has also been nominated to a position at Interior reviewed by that committee, but he does not enjoy bipartisan support.

Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer for Interior, has been nominated to fill the vacant role as solicitor for the department.

But he has been criticized by Democrats for his role in Interior’s controversial public records review process and responses to questions about it they said lacked candor.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else about, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got” about Jorjani, said Sen.

Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."

As President Trump heads into a crucial meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, sitting by his side will be Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is quietly but steadily pushing U.S.-China policy into a more competitive and often confrontational position.

Pompeo’s first year as the nation’s top diplomat focused largely on North Korea and Iran, but he is now spending more time and attention on dealing with China. For example, Pompeo often attends “Saturday morning seminars” at the State Department, where outside experts come in to talk about strategic issues detached from the daily crises — and where China is the most frequent topic.

Increasingly, Pompeo has been speaking out about China’s malign activities, while privately asking his staff to produce an overarching analysis of the motivations behind the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct and strategies to respond.

Their challenge is to take the Trump administration’s various actions on China and weave them into a broader strategy that can gain bipartisan support and outlive the current administration. “We are trying to create an intellectually persuasive argument about China being the number one challenge to the United States,” a senior State Department official told me.

The project, led by State Policy Planning Director Kiron Skinner and Miles Yu, a U.S. Naval Academy history professor, faced criticism after Skinner described the U.S.-China competition as “a fight with a really different civilization and ideology” in April. Critics of the Trump administration’s China approach seized upon those remarks, as did the Chinese government. State Department officials said her remarks, which also referred to China as “not Caucasian,” were taken out of context.

But Pompeo’s State Department has concluded that decades of engagement-focused U.S. policy have failed, and now the United States and its partners must change course and respond to the Chinese government’s strategy and behavior.

“We fundamentally erred by underestimating and misunderstanding China’s true intention, which is to create a Chinese Communist Party-dominated world order to replace the world order created by the U.S. and its allies,” the official said. “It’s not a clash of civilizations, it’s a clash of political systems.”

Critics like to say Trump’s China approach represents a Cold War mentality or a zero-sum game. That misunderstands what the U.S. government is trying to do. Pompeo’s approach is to separate the areas of the U.S.-China relationship where confrontation is needed from those where cooperation is mutually beneficial.

And while Pompeo hasn’t given a headline China speech such as the one Vice President Pence gave last year, he has ramped up his public criticism of Beijing. He called for Beijing to release more than 1 million ethnic minorities held in internment camps and heavily criticized Beijing’s human rights practices on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

In a May speech in Finland, Pompeo warned against Chinese encroachment in the Arctic. Two days later in London, he linked China’s internal repression, economic aggression and technological ambition as part of one comprehensive strategy and called on allies to help confront it by shunning Chinese tech companies.

“In China, we face a new kind of challenge. It’s an authoritarian regime that’s integrated economically into the West in ways the Soviet Union never was,” he said.

As secretary of state, Pompeo must balance confronting China with maintaining Beijing’s cooperation on issues such as North Korea and Iran. He must also balance limited diplomatic resources. Officials say he plans to shift personnel and expertise broadly and within each embassy to increase the focus on China.

Shortly after taking office, Pompeo sought to replace Rex Tillerson’s choice for assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Susan Thornton, whose pro-engagement views clashed with those of her Trump administration colleagues. The replacement effort took a year, but this month retired Air Force Gen. David Stilwell, whose views on China track Pompeo’s, was finally confirmed by the Senate for the job.

There’s a sense that Pompeo’s argument is directed internally, as well. Some officials, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are resisting a more confrontational China policy. Trump wants to be tough on China on trade and economic aggression but shows little interest in China’s human rights violations or its coercion of Taiwan, for example.

Skinner compared the State Department’s effort to George Kennan’s Long Telegram, which formed the basis for the Cold War containment approach. But she was not saying China is like the Soviet Union; she was saying the China challenge is more complex and, in a way, more daunting.

Kennan, in fact, was a realist who believed in accommodating the Soviet Union. Pompeo is no Kennan; he’s much more hawkish.

The truth is, nobody knows where Trump will end up on China on any specific point. But Pompeo’s twin approach of confronting China now while planning for longer-term resilience against Beijing’s strategy is meant to ensure that the ongoing shift in Washington over China is not dependent on any one administration.

Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

Trump EPA OKs ‘Emergency’ Use of Bee-Killing Pesticide on 13.9 Million Acres,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Jordan Simmons', 'Olivia Rosane', 'Arcadia Power', 'Natural Resources Defense Council', 'Modern Farmer', 'Jordan Davidson']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/emergency-trump-epa-pesticides-2638979880.html,"More than 40 percent of insects could go extinct globally in the next few decades. So why did the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last week OK the 'emergency' use of the bee-killing pesticide sulfoxaflor on 13.9 million acres?

EcoWatch teamed up with Center for Biological Diversity via EcoWatch Live on Facebook to find out why. Environmental Health Director and Senior Attorney Lori Ann Burd explained how there is a loophole in the The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act under section 18, ""that allows for entities and states to request emergency exemptions to spraying pesticides where they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to spray.""

In a press release sent to EcoWatch, the Center for Biological Diversity stated: The approval includes 2019 crops of cotton and sorghum in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Ten of the 11 states have been granted the approvals for at least four consecutive years for the same ""emergency."" Five have been given approvals for at least six consecutive years. If an occurrence is happening six years in a row, does that justify an emergency? ""This administration has been grossly abusing this exemption to allow the use of this one pesticide called sulfoxaflor on a vast acreage year after year,"" said Burd. Our biodiversity is at serious risk. For example, in Texas — where 5.8 million acres got emergency exemption to spray — more than 800 native bee species and eight species of bumblebees reside. It is also an important migration route for monarch butterflies. ""Monarch butterflies and eight species of bumblebees do overlap with Texas counties where there is sulfoxaflor spraying,"" said Burd. ""Even at subacute, very low doses, sufoxaflor will have a very dramatic effect on bumblebee reproduction."" The purpose of sulfoxaflor is to kill insects.

Farmers have only gotten away with spraying sulfoxaflor because they were granted emergency. The EPA has not approved the lethal insecticide sulfoxaflor to be used on sorghum because it is known to attract bees. At one point the EPA did allow the use of sulfoxaflor on cotton, however the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the approval — the result of a lawsuit brought to them by beekeepers. In a summary following the vacated approval in 2015, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit published conclusions: The panel held that because the EPA's decision to unconditionally register sulfoxaflor was based on flawed and limited data, the EPA's unconditional approval was not supported by substantial evidence. The panel vacated the EPA's unconditional registration because given the precariousness of bee populations, leaving the EPA's registration of sulfoxaflor in place risked more potential environmental harm than vacating it. Criticism has been raised by the fact-checking resource Snopes on the grounds that it is misleading to imply that Trump is the only one who's approved emergency exemptions for sulfoxaflor. EcoWatch asked the Center for Biological diversity to respond. ""This is not a new problem,"" said Burd. ""This has been going on for six consecutive years and we have not been in the Trump administration for six consecutive years."" So, yes, Trump's EPA did this, but ""this is by no means a new problem. Our pesticide registration and approval process is fundamentally broken. EPA's pesticide office is captured by industry and they are not doing their jobs protecting human health and the environment from these pesticides,"" said Burd.

EcoWatch asked Burd if there anything the public can do to stop these emergency approvals and prevent the use of toxic pesticides.

Burd suggested EcoWatchers consider signing a petition ""demanding that Trump's EPA stop rubber-stamping 'emergency' uses of pesticides that wreak havoc on our environment."" EcoWatchers can also help by getting involved with various groups working to protect the environment, choosing organic, refusing the use of pesticides at home, talking about not using them at work or at a homeowners association, supporting local ordinances going after pesticide issues, voting often or early and planting pollinator friendly gardens in rural and urban environments."
USDA identifies unapproved GMO wheat growing wild in Washington,https://www.upi.com,['Jessie Higgins'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/27/USDA-identifies-unapproved-GMO-wheat-growing-wild-in-Washington/6441561660173/,"No genetically engineered wheat is approved for use in the United States.

June 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the genetically modified, unapproved wheat found growing wild in Washington state as a grain created by Monsanto.

The wheat was genetically engineered to withstand the company's Roundup herbicide, which would allow farmers to better kill other plants without affecting their wheat crops. It's called Roundup Ready wheat.

The company also makes Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, both of which are approved by the USDA.

The wheat, also called MON 71800, does not have USDA approval -- no genetically engineered wheat is approved from commercial use anywhere in the world.

Monsanto petitioned for its approval in 2002 and 2004, but chose to withdraw its applications before the agency issued a ruling, said Rick Coker, a USDA spokesman.

However, the Food and Drug Administration completed a ""voluntary consultation"" of MON 71800 in 2004, ""concluding that this GE wheat is as safe as food and feed as non-GE wheat currently on the market,"" Coker said.

The Roundup Ready wheat was found growing wild in eastern Washington state in early June in an area that was ""possibly on the site of a former [Monsanto] field trial,"" Charla Lord, a spokeswoman for Bayer, which recently purchased Monsanto, said shortly after it was found.

The USDA still is reviewing the situation, and anticipates the investigation will take between six and nine months, Coker said.

Bayer had no comment on the USDA's most recent findings. Shortly after the USDA announced the discovery June 7, the company issued the statement, ""We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation. We will provide more information when possible."""
Reporters erupt after DHS chief McAleenan walks out of presser after four questions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/reporters-erupt-after-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-walks-out-of-presser-after-four-questions,"Reporters erupted in frustration with Kevin McAleenan after the acting homeland security secretary abruptly departed a rescheduled press conference after taking only four questions amid crossfire over questions about his leadership.

After reading Friday from a prepared statement for 11 minutes, McAleenan opened the floor to questions. He took four of them over seven minutes then cut off the briefing and said ""thanks"" before exiting.

""This is ridiculous! We get no..."" one reporter in the front row yelled as McAleenan walked out.

""Seriously, Andrew, it's so unprofessional,"" another reporter said, directing her comment to the only DHS official still onstage, acting Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan.

""Four questions and we haven't had a press conference in months,"" one person said, referring to McAleenan's installation in his current role nearly three months earlier.

""We'll be more engaging in the future,"" Meehan responded.

""Why don't we keep rolling and you keep answering our questions?"" one of the reporters asked.

Reporters immediately began asking a handful of additional questions before Meehan excused himself after four minutes of it.

McAleenan was accused by five current and former senior administration officials, in comments published by the Washington Examiner over the weekend, of attempting to sabotage a federal immigration operation by leaking details to a media outlet.

Since then, top officials at DHS and across the administration have used various press outlets, including the Washington Examiner, to try to undermine McAleenan by calling for him to resign and charging he is a liar for an alleged cover-up of what they claim was his own leak.

The Friday afternoon press conference was announced in an email from DHS around 9:30 a.m. The Washington Examiner, which received an invitation to attend the same event a day earlier, did not receive an invitation Friday.

On Thursday, the Washington Examiner reported that McAleenan was expected to lay the blame on Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Mark Morgan for the revelation in a Washington Post story of details about immigration raids. The report was published a half-hour before the Thursday briefing was scheduled to take place. Moments before it began, DHS abruptly called off the briefing.

A DHS spokesman claimed it was because the department did not want McAleenan's comments to interfere with Capitol Hill negotiations for supplemental border funding, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had publicly announced nearly an hour before the briefing the chamber would pass the Senate's supplemental bill, according to reporters.

DHS had said Thursday the event would be used for McAleenan to discuss the ""supplemental funding request for DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the changes needed to the immigration legal framework to address the humanitarian and border security crisis.""

McAleenan did not address the leaks in his appearance Friday."
