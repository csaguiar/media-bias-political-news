NBC News analysis declares Donald Trump the winner of first Democratic debate,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/donald-trump-winner-of-first-democratic-debate,"An NBC News analyst declared President Trump the winner of the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle.

Author and reporter Jonathan Allen expressed surprise that Trump emerged ""largely unscathed"" as the field of 10 candidates mostly avoided direct attacks on him.

Allen said the Democrats seemed more focused on positioning themselves furthest to the left to win over primary voters, rather than appealing to the swing voters that decided the 2016 election.

""For long stretches, it seemed, they completely forgot about the man who has been at the center of pretty much every discussion among Democrats for the last two-plus years — the man they're competing to take on next year. The obvious reason: The motivation to beat each other was, on this night, more urgent than defeating Trump — a life-or-death moment for some of their campaigns. Trump was the chief beneficiary of that dynamic,"" Allen wrote.

MSNBC HOSTS CLASH AFTER ONE SAYS NOBODY ON STAGE COULD BEAT TRUMP

He noted that after the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that ignoring Trump was intentional because ""he’s an old show that people are getting tired of.”

Allen argued that by doing so, Democrats could allow Trump ""to exploit their divisions and position himself for re-election"" and ""he was one step closer to that after Wednesday's debate.""

The sentiment was shared by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who said it was “a missed opportunity” for Democrats to not go after frontrunner Joe Biden or President Trump. Another MSNBC commentator, Donny Deutsch declared confidently after the debate that none of the 10 candidates on the stage could defeat Trump next year, including Warren.

Meantime, New York Post columnist John Podhoretz saw things similarly, taking particular issue with the candidates' far-left push on immigration. He said the candidates ""spent far more time talking about how they would help illegal immigrants than about how they would help the voters they most need to win over"" and that will benefit Trump.

""If I were Brad Parscale, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, I would be dancing a jig — because if this is the way the Democrats and the media want to discuss the economy and immigration, he is going to have a field day with the quotes they will generate from now until the election,"" he wrote."
Tillerson reveals frustrations about Kushner working behind his back,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kylie Atwood', 'Zachary Cohen']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/politics/tillerson-kushner-frustrations/index.html,"Washington (CNN) One evening during his tenure as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was out to dinner in Washington when the restaurant owner asked if he would like to say hello to the Mexican Foreign Minister, Luis Videgaray, who also happened to be at the same establishment. As they walked to the back of the restaurant Tillerson was shocked to find Videgaray, who Tillerson did not know was in town, dining with President Donald Trump 's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner .

The surprise encounter was revealed by Tillerson when he quietly met senior staff of Democratic chair Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul from the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month.

Tillerson who was unceremoniously fired by Trump last March spoke at length about how Kushner did not consult with the State Department or other agencies before getting involved in foreign affairs.

Tillerson also met Engel and McCaul, but there is no transcript of that meeting, which was agreed to before the meeting took place.

""I could see the color go out of the face of the Foreign Secretary of Mexico,"" Tillerson told the staffers, about the inadvertent restaurant meeting, according to the transcript. ""I said: Welcome to Washington. And I said: I don't want to interrupt what y'all are doing I said: Give me a call next time you're coming to town. And I left it at that.""

While Tillerson said that he later learned that the two men discussed matters that had already been run through the State Department and had his approval, he said that the foreign minister ""was rather shocked"" to learn that Kushner had not told the then-secretary about their meeting beforehand.

""One of the challenges I think that everyone had -- has had to learn to deal with was the role, the unique situation with the President's son-in-law and daughter being part {of} the White House advisory team. That's, you know, it's unusual. I don't recall it ever being the case before, not that there's anything wrong with it,"" Tillerson said, according to the transcript.

""There was not a real clear understanding of the role, responsibilities, authorities, and whatnot, which made it challenging for everyone, I think, in terms of how to deal with any activities that might be undertaken by others that were not defined within the national security process itself,"" he said.

When asked about this characterization, Kushner's camp has pushed back.

""Jared and the White House were coordinating with the state department, the problem is that Rex Tillerson couldn't figure out how to coordinate with the state department,"" wrote an Administration official.

Kushner's involvement in Middle East policy

Despite his lack of experience, Kushner was immediately thrust into the center of US foreign relations -- with responsiibility for many tough issues facing the administration.

His portfolio has expanded to include a globe-spanning collection of foreign assignments.

But it was Kushner's involvement in issues related to the Middle East policy presented particular problems for Tillerson, especially those involving Saudi Arabia, as the President's son-in-law has maintained close personal ties with the Kingdom's Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman.

Tillerson said that he did not have a ""particularly unique"" understanding of the relationship between Kushner and the crown prince but did say that he was aware there was ""a lot of communication"" between the two men and occasional trips.

He also said that Kushner mapped out a comprehensive strategy for US-Saudi relations -- a plan that Tillerson said he was only informed of very late in the process.

""At some point... Mr. Kushner contacted me and said: You know, I'd like for you to meet with this person so they can review -- this is what we've been working on for some time, so you could take a look at that,"" Tillerson said during his interview.

Tillerson then reviewed the plan, which included arms sales to Saudi Arabia and a ""roadmap"" for the future of the US-Saudi relationship. Tillerson did not appear to know the details of how the project had evolved but said he brought a State Department official with him to hear the contours of Kushner's plan.

Additionally, Tillerson was asked about events that occurred in May 2017 ahead of the President's decision to support a blockade of Qatar , led by the Saudis and United Arab Emirates.

At that time, Tillerson was in the Saudi capital of Riyadh prior to the President's Middle East summit but said that he was not aware that tensions in the region had risen despite indications that the situation was escalating.

He was also unaware that Kushner and Steve Bannon had hosted a private dinner with the rulers of Saudi Arabia and UAE around that time where the Gulf leaders presented their plans for a blockade of Qatar, according to the transcript.

'It makes me angry'

""What is your reaction to a meeting of that sort having taken place without your knowledge?"" Tillerson was asked during the May interview.

""It makes me angry,"" he responded. ""I didn't have a say. The State Department's views were never expressed.""

While Tillerson would not explicitly address questions related to Kushner's views of the blockade, he suggested Kushner and Bannon could have known it was going to happen. Tillerson also made it clear that he and then Secretary of Defense James Mattis were kept in the dark and blindsided when the announcement was made.

""I was surprised,"" Tillerson said. ""I think both Secretary Mattis and I both felt, given the significant footprint of our Defense Department assets and my role, that someone would have called us and told us.""

Kushner also did not tell Tillerson or anyone at State that he or his family was seeking the help of a Qatari sovereign wealth fund to refinance a property that they owned in New York City, and that their efforts had failed. But according to the transcript Tillerson refused to engage in a study of the timeline which, if extrapolated, could have indicated a connection between the refinancing and the blockade. Tillerson said he never had a conversation at State on how Kushner family finances could impact foreign policy.

Tillerson on Trump

Just as Tillerson had to handle the challenge of working with Kushner, he also experienced a learning curve in his working relationship with Trump. Tillerson said that the information he gave to Trump had to be brief in order for the President to absorb it.

""I learned to be much more concise with what I wanted to bring in front of him. Early days I came in with way too much information,"" Tillerson said. ""It caused me to have to get very, very focused on, you know, what's the most important thing I want him to remember about this discussion.""

The House staffers were particularly interested in Trump's May 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany. Tillerson said Putin seemed to be more prepared than Trump for the encounter.

""The meeting went much longer than the scheduled 30 minutes. So obviously the discussion was longer, lengthier. And on the issue that we proposed, President Putin had a great deal of interest in it. And he had clearly done a lot of thinking about it,"" Tillerson said, without specifically detailing what that issue was.

""We didn't undertake that kind of preparation for the President because we didn't expect that that's the way it was going to go now. As it played out, the President engaged with his views. He asked me on several occasions, you know, what did I think about what was being discussed.""

Tillerson did say that Trump raised the issue of election interference when the two met in Hamburg. ""The President did raise it, I can tell you that,"" he said.

In addition to discussing the meeting with Putin, Tillerson said he faced challenges hiring staff to fill key roles in the State Department.

""It was very difficult to get people through the vetting process ... oftentimes people were rejected by the White House Office of Personnel for reasons ... that they had,"" he said.

He said there was a particular problem hiring anyone who had expressed opposition to the President.

""If people had ever signed a 'Never Trump' letter, that would often times disqualify them. If they had tweeted or retweeted something that the White House office thought was inappropriate, then that might disqualify them. If they had a spouse who supported the other candidate, that would disqualify them,"" he said."

Twitter says it will label tweets from Trump and other leaders that break its rules,https://www.cnn.com,"[""Donie O'Sullivan"", 'Cnn Business']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/tech/twitter-trump-rules/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Twitter plans to place a disclaimer on future tweets from world leaders that break its rules but which Twitter decides are in the ""public interest,"" the company said in a blog post Thursday.

This policy change could face its most prominent test in President Trump. Trump has repeatedly tested Twitter's community standards with his regular tirades on the platform and some of the president's tweets have run afoul of Twitter's rules.

has in the past allowed tweets from Trump and other world leaders to remain online, even though they broke the company's rules, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business, because it believes the tweets are in the public interest.

But putting a disclaimer on one of Trump's tweets would almost certainly bring a firestorm of criticism down on Twitter's head. Republicans in Washington, including Trump, often claim without real evidence that technology companies are biased against conservatives . Such a disclaimer on a Trump tweet, even if he had clearly violated Twitter's rules, would provoke a new cycle of such complaints at a time when Washington is increasingly investigating Big Tech over concerns about antitrust and privacy.

""This is not about perceived bias but about providing more clarity if our rules have been broken,"" a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business.

The disclaimer Twitter will place on tweets that break its rules but it decides to keep on the platform.

Asked by CNN Business, Twitter would not provide examples of tweets that it had previously kept up as being in the public interest despite rule violations.

The new feature will make clear when Twitter makes that call in the future.

""The Twitter Rules about abusive behavior apply to this Tweet,"" the disclaimer will read. ""However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain available.""

There are some exceptions, however. ""[D]irect threats of violence or calls to commit violence against an individual"" are ""unlikely to be considered in the public interest,"" Twitter said in the blog post.

Twitter said a ""cross-functional"" team, including representatives from its trust and safety, legal, and public policy teams will decide if a tweet is in the public interest.

The company provided a list of criteria that would inform this decision, including ""Whether preserving a Tweet will allow others to hold the government official, candidate for public office, or appointee accountable for their statements.""

""When a Tweet has this notice placed on it, it will feature less prominently on Twitter,"" the company said, adding that such tweets will not appear in Twitter's algorithmically generated ""Top Tweets,"" its live event pages, and some other features.

The new feature will apply to verified government officials, political candidates and people who are being considered for a government position and who have more than 100,000 followers, Twitter said."
Tillerson Says Kushner Bypassed Him and Mattis to Make Foreign Policy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Sharon Lafraniere']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/rex-tillerson-trump.html,"Mr. Tillerson said he did.

A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said Thursday night that “Jared consistently follows proper protocols” with the National Security Council and State Department. The dinner in Riyadh as described “never happened,” he said, and no one in the White House was “involved in the blockade.” He added that Mr. Kushner’s work with Mexico had led to positive results on trade and other issues.

The New York Times obtained a copy of the committee’s interview transcript before its release on Thursday afternoon. Parts had been redacted at the request of Mr. Tillerson and the State Department.

Mr. Tillerson became secretary of state in February 2017, after being asked to meet with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and two other aides, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, in Trump Tower. But Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump subsequently clashed over policy, the president’s management style and his intellectual capacity — Mr. Tillerson is said to have once called Mr. Trump a “moron” to other officials — before Mr. Tillerson was fired in March 2018.

Mr. Tillerson also alienated State Department officials and career employees because he tried to cut the budget, left important posts open and, in their eyes, remained aloof — all of which he was asked about in the committee interview.

The most telling anecdotes show Mr. Kushner and, to a degree, Mr. Bannon, making foreign policy in the shadows.

Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that in the weeks leading up to a presidential summit in Riyadh in May 2017, Saudi officials did not give him any indication of their deepening political disputes with Qatar and their aim to join with the Emiratis and other Arab nations to impose a blockade.

One night around May 20, Saudi and Emirati leaders met with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon over dinner and told the Americans of their plans. Mr. Tillerson said he had not heard of the dinner until the committee interview."
New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-military-athletes-policy-defense,"President Trump on Wednesday told Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to come up with a policy that would allow athletes enrolled in military academies to play professional sports upon graduation.

The policy would be a rollback from what the Trump administration enacted in 2017, according to The Hill.

“Highly talented cadets and midshipmen who receive the extraordinary benefits of an education from an Academy or through a ROTC program at taxpayer expense should be able to both take advantage of the short window of time during which playing professional sports is realistically possible, while also honoring the commitment they have made to our Armed Forces and our country,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Trump signed a presidential memo to give Esper 120 days to come up with the policy.

“This will involve consulting with the civilian and uniformed leadership of the Military Departments,” a separate White House statement added.

Trump expressed interest in changing the policy earlier this year when he was awarding the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy to West Point after they defeated the Naval Academy in last season’s matchup.

Naval Academy pitcher Noah Song stands to benefit from the policy immediately. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the fourth round of the MLB Draft earlier this month.

“I hate to speculate on what people are thinking because that’s their job and they know what they’re doing,” Navy coach Paul Kostacopoulos told MLB.com. “But I do think there was some consideration that had to have been taken, considering that he does have a service commitment.”

TRUMP PRAISES FORMER NFL MVP, SAYS HE'S GOING TO READ HIS BOOK ON TRIP TO JAPAN

New England Patriots long snapper Joe Cardona benefited from the policy in 2015, allowing him to turn pro upon graduation. He has won two Super Bowls and was recently promoted by the U.S. Navy from lieutenant junior grade to lieutenant on the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

An uneasy tenure: how Tillerson found himself cut out by Kushner,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Patricia Zengerle', 'Lesley Wroughton']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/27/an-uneasy-tenure-how-tillerson-found-himself-cut-out-by-kushner/23758293/,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - In one of the most awkward moments of his time as U.S. secretary of state, Rex Tillerson realized his Mexican counterpart was in Washington only when he walked into a restaurant and found him dining with President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.

On another occasion, neither Tillerson nor Jim Mattis, who was then secretary of defense, knew Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates planned to blockade their regional rival Qatar even though Kushner and another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, had been told about it at a secret dinner with their governments.

Tillerson recounted the embarrassing incidents in a seven-hour closed-door interview with leaders of the House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee last month.

Trump fired Tillerson in March 2018 after months of friction and on Twitter called him lazy and ""dumb as a rock.""

Tillerson's testimony, a transcript of which was seen by Reuters House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, shows how Tillerson's 13-month tenure as secretary of state, one of the shortest ever, was undermined by public disagreements with Trump and a sense that the former ExxonMobil chief executive was being excluded from key discussions.

Tillerson said Trump is undisciplined and does not like to read and that he had to make briefings short and simple.

""I had to adapt to the fact that it wasn't going to be useful to give him something and say this is, you know, this is an article worth reading,"" Tillerson said.

A recurring theme in the interview was Tillerson’s frustration with Kushner conducting his own diplomacy from the White House, at times without the knowledge of Tillerson or Mattis.

Tillerson said he had just arrived for dinner at the Washington restaurant when the owner shared the unexpected news that Mexico's then-foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was at a table near the back in case he wanted to say hello.

Tillerson walked over and found Videgaray with Kushner.

""I could see the color go out of the face of the foreign secretary of Mexico as I very - I smiled big and I said: 'Welcome to Washington,'"" Tillerson told the congressional panel.

""And I said: 'I don't want to interrupt what y'all are doing.' I said: 'Give me a call next time you're coming to town.' And I left it at that,"" Tillerson said.

'IT MAKES ME ANGRY'

The Foreign Affairs Committee's new chairman, Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, asked Tillerson to talk to the panel as part of its oversight of foreign policy, after Democrats won control of the House in November 2018 elections.

In the meeting, Tillerson said there had never been discussion of Kushner's or Trump's business dealings in relation to foreign policy. He emphasized that Trump never asked him to break the law.

Tillerson said he and Mattis learned about the 2017 blockade of Qatar during a joint visit to Australia, which left them scrambling to determine the extent of the crisis and safety of U.S. assets in the Gulf.

He appeared surprised when told during the interview that the blockade was discussed at a private dinner by Kushner, Bannon and leaders of Saudi Arabia and UAE.

""It makes me angry,"" Tillerson said, ""because I didn't have a say. The State Department's views were never expressed.""

Tillerson also discussed Kushner's relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his travels to the Middle East without consulting U.S. embassies.

He said he raised the issue of such trips with Kushner, who said he would ""try to do better."" However, Tillerson said not much changed and that it made his job more difficult.

Trump's presidency has been dogged by accusations, which he denies, that his campaign colluded with Russia in 2016 as Moscow worked to boost the Republican's chances of winning the White House.

Tillerson described how Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived well prepared for a key meeting in Hamburg in July 2017, but the U.S. side had expected a ""fairly short"" session at which the two presidents would get acquainted.

The meeting lasted hours, with no one in the room taking notes.

Trump said afterward he believed Putin when the Russian leader denied Moscow had interfered in the election, drawing criticism because U.S. intelligence agencies had determined the opposite.

DHS chief McAleenan scraps news conference with minutes to spare as leak charges fly,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-scraps-news-conference-with-minutes-to-spare-as-leak-charges-fly,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan abruptly canceled a late afternoon press conference he had called earlier in the day amid crossfire over who leaked details of a pending immigration operation and an effort by senior administration officials to undermine him by branding him a liar.

DHS announced the briefing early Thursday morning and said McAleenan would discuss the ""supplemental funding request for DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the changes needed to the immigration legal framework to address the humanitarian and border security crisis.""

Approximately 30 reporters and cameramen gathered inside a room at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, which also holds U.S. Customs and Border Protection's headquarters.

Moments before the briefing was slated to begin, a DHS spokesman said the event had been canceled because the department did not want McAleenan's comments to interfere with Capitol Hill negotiations for supplemental border funding, even though House action on the border had been strongly expected to take place Thursday because lawmakers are scheduled to head back to their districts Friday for a weeklong recess.

The Washington Examiner published a report in the hour before the briefing that cited three sources with first-hand knowledge of what McAleenan planned to say at the briefing, asserting he would blame Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its chief, Mark Morgan, for the leak of a nationwide federal immigration operation last week.

In an interview with radio host Brian Kilmeade that aired midday Thursday, McAleenan said, ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

The same two current administration officials were among five who accused McAleenan of being the mastermind behind the leak of government information that the Washington Post published last Friday. In separate conversations Thursday, each official said the secretary had now gone from a ""leaker"" to a ""liar.""

“The acting secretary is a leaker, a liar, and should resign immediately. He’s lost the confidence of everyone,"" one person said.

""He's a leaker and liar. And he’s trying to walk it back, but why didn’t he come out and deny it right away? He danced around the issue,"" a second senior administration official said.

A third person who spoke with the Washington Examiner Wednesday night said McAleenan instructed acting ICE Director Mark Morgan twice in the two weeks leading up to the operation that he would not be allowed to carry out the operation.

When Morgan refused, McAleenan allegedly had a subordinate share the information with the Post reporter, who traveled with the secretary on a government plane to the border the day before the story was published.

The secretary, who was not seen at the briefing at any point, posted a statement on Twitter in the hour after it was canceled, just as the House voted.

...and ensure swift transfer of unaccompanied children into well-equipped @HHSgov facilities. I will continue to work with Congress to pursue targeted changes to the immigration laws to address the pull factors driving the crisis. — Acting Sec. Kevin McAleenan (@DHSMcAleenan) June 27, 2019

One senior administration official said McAleenan was trying to take credit for the bill's passage despite having been out of country all week as lawmakers worked on a compromise.

""Spending package came and went while the acting secretary was absent. The last ditch effort to help claim credit was too little too late. The cake was baked while he was out of the country,"" the official wrote in a text message Thursday evening.

A second senior administration official said the secretary was trying ""take credit and stand by himself for the supplemental."""
The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind. And if the defender general can’t protect the rule of law, then maybe, by publicly confronting the failure of DOJ lawyering, she can avenge it.

"President Trump goes back on 2017 decision, will now allow service academy players to go pro",https://www.cbssports.com,"['Tom Fornelli', 'Cbs Sports Writer']",,,,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/president-trump-goes-back-on-2017-decision-will-now-allow-service-academy-players-to-go-pro/,"President Donald Trump has signed a presidential memorandum that orders the Pentagon to create a new policy that will allow athletes from the nation's service academies to play professional sports immediately following graduation. The memorandum states that athletes from the service academies, as well as the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), should be allowed to defer their military service obligations due to the ""short window of time"" the graduates have to ""take advantage of their athletic talents"" while playing professional sports.

The defense secretary has 120 days to develop a plan to allow this to happen.

The President's decision goes against a decision he made in 2017. Shortly after being elected, President Trump rescinded a policy from President Obama's term that allowed service academy graduates to go directly to the pros upon graduation. At the time, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis said Trump had rescinded the previous rule because the service academies ""exist to develop future officers"" and that graduates should fulfill their obligations for duty.

President Trump said in May 2019 that he was considering making this change while he was presenting the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy to the Army football team while it was visiting the White House.

The 2019 NFL Draft saw Air Force long-snapper Austin Cutting drafted in the seventh round by the Minnesota Vikings. The last player drafted from Navy was Keenan Reynolds by the Baltimore Ravens in 2016, and the last player from Army to be drafted was defensive back Caleb Campbell in 2008.

The last basketball players from each of the service academies were drafted in 1978 (Air Force's Tom Schneeberger and Army's Gary Winston), and of course, Navy's David Robinson was the first overall selection by San Antonio in 1987."
Most House impeachment inquiry backers are Pelosi's investigators,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/pelosi-investigators-impeachment-inquiry-1383835,"Some Democrats argue that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s calculus on impeachment is unlikely to be swayed by the sheer number of Democrats who endorse the process. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Congress Most House impeachment inquiry backers are Pelosi's investigators Nearly half of the Democrats on the six investigative committees are publicly ready to pull the trigger.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a ready-made reply when pressed on impeaching President Donald Trump: Democrats have tasked six powerful committees with investigating Trump’s conduct, and they’ll “follow the facts” to chart a course for the House.

But a POLITICO review of those six committees reveals that the members of their members are significantly more inclined to back impeachment than the rest of the House.

Story Continued Below

The panels in Pelosi’s talking points are the Intelligence, Judiciary, Oversight, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services and Ways and Means committees. Each has been charged with investigating an aspect of Trump’s finances, personal conduct, foreign relationships and business ties. As impeachment fervor has raged among progressives across the country, Pelosi has consistently referenced the six committees and urged patience.

“I'm very proud of the work of the — our committees, six great committees, following the facts and making decisions about how we go forward,” Pelosi said at a June press conference.

She expressed similar sentiments a month earlier: “We have six committees, so many members so experienced in terms of the law and our Constitution, chairmen who are excellent — we’ll take our lead from them,” Pelosi said at a May event in Massachusetts.

Yet of the 114 Democrats who sit on the committees, almost half — 50 — publicly support launching a formal impeachment inquiry, with several others privately considering joining them in the coming days or weeks.

These members make up the bulk of the more than 80 House Democrats who have endorsed impeachment proceedings. And as those numbers grow, so too might the pressure on Pelosi to change course.

Many lawmakers say an impeachment inquiry is the only way to break a relentless White House effort to stonewall the committees’ investigations. Others say Trump’s conduct described in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report warrants impeachment, and others still assert that Trump has committed numerous “high crimes and misdemeanors” that necessitate removal from office.

For now, Pelosi remains unmoved, concerned that any political blowback could cost Democrats their House majority. And while the rank-and-file on the committees are warming to impeachment, the chairmen mostly remain in Pelosi’s camp — an important bulwark for the speaker.

Pelosi and her lieutenants have also argued that impeachment could polarize the country and backfire because the Republican-controlled Senate is virtually guaranteed to acquit Trump — handing the president a potent talking point heading into the 2020 election season. A senior Democratic aide noted that the speaker has indicated she wants to see public sentiment shift in favor of impeachment, as well as meaningful Republican buy-in, before she would consider it.

Democratic lawmakers and aides say it’s no surprise that the committees leading the Trump investigations are the most receptive to calls for impeachment proceedings — they’re the ones in the trenches with the White House and most familiar with Trump’s stonewalling.

“Most have seen enough to recognize that there is robust evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight committees.

The group of Democrats favoring impeachment proceedings is surprisingly ideologically diverse. It includes some of the most progressive members of the House Democratic caucus — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) — and lawmakers who have been designated by their own party as five of the most vulnerable in 2020: Reps. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.), Sean Casten (D-Ill.), and Harley Rouda (D-Calif.).

Rouda, who announced his decision on pursuing impeachment to POLITICO on Thursday, said it was “not difficult at all.” The freshman Democrat, who represents a historically Republican district, had set a deadline of the end of June for the Trump administration to comply with all congressional oversight demands and subpoenas.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/34/b9/35a7b14444e0b28c9fb2960fdcfb/190613-pelosi.png"" true

“For me, it was eyes watering up, a solemn moment. For me, the interpretation of the Constitution should not be driven by who’s in office or polling or political winds,” Rouda said in an interview. “I’m disappointed that there are members here who interpret the Constitution differently based on who’s in office.”

But some Democrats argued that Pelosi’s calculus on impeachment is unlikely to be swayed by the sheer number of Democrats who endorse the process — even if it becomes a majority of the caucus.

“She’s pretty tough. It should ratchet up the pressure. But I don’t believe it is,” said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), a senior member of the Oversight Committee who supports Pelosi’s view. “She is firmly convinced that she is right. And I don’t disagree with her. I think she is right. Sometimes, knowing you’re right helps you resist unwanted pressure.”

Other lawmakers and aides say Pelosi’s deference to the six committees is really code for her reliance on the six committee chairs — who are constantly taking the temperature of their colleagues and reporting back to her. These trusted lieutenants meet with Pelosi weekly to discuss investigative strategy, and most have hewed closely to her position on impeachment.

“[M]y judgment will spring from the judgment of our committee chairs,” Pelosi said last month.

Of the six, only Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), has called for Trump’s impeachment.

Yet one Democratic lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that the committee chairs themselves are susceptible to pressure from their members, which means the growing ranks of those favoring an impeachment inquiry could change the equation. Additionally, pro-impeachment Democrats hope Mueller’s July 17 testimony might open up the floodgates.

Each of the six investigative committees has faced different challenges in their efforts to probe Trump, leading to varying conclusions by their members.

The committees have taken a hard line against the Trump administration, holding officials in contempt of Congress and preparing to wage battles in federal court to enforce their subpoenas that have been summarily ignored.

“My personal position does not derive from being on an oversight committee,” Malinowski said in an interview. “It was not just the Mueller report. It was the continued obstruction of the investigations and the oversight requests.”

To calculate the support for impeachment among the six committees, POLITICO reviewed public statements by the lawmakers and interviewed dozens of House members and aides. The analysis accounted for the more-than-two-dozen members who sit on two of the six committees, and it excluded the three non-voting delegates from U.S. territories and the District of Columbia who sit on various committees. Some of the pro-impeachment Democrats sit on more than one of the critical six panels.

Here’s the breakdown of support for an impeachment inquiry from Democrats on each committee.

Judiciary: 15 out of 24 Democrats

The Judiciary Committee, which is traditionally tasked with leading the impeachment process, has been the most directly engaged in a confrontation with the White House over access to documents and witnesses related to Mueller’s probe — particularly the evidence that Trump obstructed the investigation.

The committee’s chairman, Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), has privately advocated to launch an impeachment inquiry, but he has publicly held Pelosi’s line.

Intelligence: 6 out of 13 Democrats

The Intelligence Committee has been reviewing Mueller’s evidence of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether Mueller’s still-secret counterintelligence evidence exposes national security risks.

The most recent endorsement came from Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the panel’s second-highest ranking member, in a significant win for pro-impeachment forces. Himes is a leader of the moderate New Democrats Coalition in Congress, which has generally shied away from the impeachment discussion.

“This is a moment for clarity. It’s a moment for speaking with conviction,” Himes told reporters, adding that he doesn’t buy the conventional wisdom that impeachment could help Trump politically. “On balance, a public airing of the facts… would probably work to his disadvantage.”

The committee’s chairman, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), is a close Pelosi ally and has resisted an impeachment inquiry.

Oversight: 12 out of 22 Democrats

The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), has been examining Trump’s hush payments to women who accused him of extramarital affairs in advance of the 2016 election. It has also been pursuing questions about Trump’s net worth and whether he lied to financial institutions to misrepresent his assets and debts.

Like the Judiciary Committee, a majority of the panel’s Democrats support opening an impeachment inquiry.

Financial Services: 16 out of 33 Democrats

The sprawling Financial Services Committee is the only panel among Pelosi’s six investigative teams chaired by a lawmaker who eagerly supports impeaching Trump: Rep. Maxine Waters.

The California Democrat’s committee is pursuing litigation against Deutsche Bank, which has a longstanding relationship with Trump and has been implicated in allegations over Russian money-laundering.

Ways and Means: 11 out of 25 Democrats

The powerful tax-writing committee is chaired by Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), who is seeking access to Trump’s tax returns from the IRS and recently issued a subpoena after the Treasury Department refused to comply. The Trump administration disregarded that subpoena, and Neal is expected to go to court soon to enforce it.

Foreign Affairs: 9 out of 26 Democrats

The membership of this committee is the least inclined among the big six toward an impeachment inquiry.

The panel, chaired by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), has been pursuing details of Trump’s private interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in addition to his conduct and posture on the world stage. Some of those probes even have buy-in from Republicans.

"VA ordered fake appointments to cut waiting list, whistleblower says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-va-ordered-fake-appointments-to-cut-waiting-list/2019/06/26/97e50648-9856-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Columnist

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans’ Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges such as these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve-racking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

EPA's top air policy official steps down amid scrutiny over possible ethics violations,https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/2732451-EPAs-top-air-policy-official-steps-down-amid-scrutiny-over-possible-ethics-violations,"WASHINGTON - Bill Wehrum spent only a year and a half as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air official before announcing plans to resign Wednesday amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

But during that time, Wehrum served as one of the chief architects of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the ambition and reach of the EPA, and to retreat from President Barack Obama's push to slash emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. He oversaw efforts to ease regulation of the coal industry, slow requirements that cars and trucks become more fuel efficient and overhaul how the agency calculates costs and benefits to favor industry.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler's announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back air pollution rules. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for ""his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.""

Environmental groups, Democrats on Capitol Hill and other critics were quick to celebrate Wehrum's departure, calling him an integral part of the Washington ""swamp"" that President Donald Trump had vowed to drain.

listen live watch live

""William Wehrum was emblematic of the administration's struggles to remain ethical,"" Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. ""While it's a good thing that Wehrum's potential ethics problems will no longer affect the agency, the tone is set at the top, and if the EPA is to clean up the mess started by Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration needs to get serious about policing its ethical failures.""

Wehrum, who was confirmed in November 2017, is the latest Trump appointee to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members - EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin - left under ethics clouds, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William ""Brock"" Long.

The Interior Department's Office of Inspector General is investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties - a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

""I have, from Day One, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,"" Wehrum said, ""because it doesn't do me any good, and it doesn't do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.""

Still, the fallout from the disclosure about Wehrum's ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets - including Politico, The New York Times and E&E News - has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a collection of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded this year.

Wehrum has said he represented the group as its own entity, rather than the individual utilities that made up its membership. But investigators on Capitol Hill have explored whether he and his former firm represented the power companies as well, according to one person familiar with the inquiry, raising the prospect that Werhum's meetings could have violated ethics rules on multiple counts. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.

Wehrum's supporters and his critics say that he has accomplished some of industry's long-sought goals. In doing so, he has rolled back some of Obama's most sweeping air policies. Last week, the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other controversial proposals as well, including one that would slow efforts to improve gas mileage for cars and light trucks. Another would limit how the EPA calculates public health benefits in proposed regulations, which could make it tougher to limit pollution sources.

""No assistant administrator at EPA had more on their plate than Bill,"" Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""He executed the job with a steady hand and got big things done.""

But what some industry officials saw as Wehrum's reasonable measures to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, critics describe as undermining the agency's mission to protect public health and the environment.

""It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,"" said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the Sierra Club.

In a phone interview, Coequyt said that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback for enlisting Wehrum's help. ""We believe he's toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA's inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump's EPA.

""I can't wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he's out the door,"" Whitehouse said in a statement. ""What do you bet it's with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?""

"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."

George F. Will: Let flawed court precedent fall,https://www.sltrib.com,"['George F. Will', 'The Washington Post']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/27/george-f-will-let-flawed/,"Washington • The doctrine that court precedents should have momentum for respect — the predictability of settled law gives citizens due notice of what is required or proscribed — is called stare decisis. This Latin translates as: “To stand by things decided.” The translation is not: “If a precedent was produced by bad reasoning and has produced irrational and unjust results, do not correct the error, just shrug, say, ‘well, to err is human,’ and continue adhering to the mistake.”

Last week, the Supreme Court was roiled by an unusually pointed disagreement about stare decisis. It occurred in a case that demonstrated how, when judicial review works well, Americans’ rights can be buttressed and American liberty enlarged by a process that begins when the denial of a right is challenged by someone who thinks that precedents, although important, are not graven in granite by the finger of God. Someone like Rose Mary Knick.

This 70-year-old got her dander up and challenged a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent that substantially impeded her ability to contest a township ordinance that significantly burdened her property rights over her 90 rural acres in eastern Pennsylvania. In the past, that state had many burials on private land, and in 2012 Knick's township decreed that all cemeteries (defined as any land ever used for burials) must be open to the public during daylight, and that township personnel could enter such properties to look for violations. There is some evidence that long ago there might have been a small burial plot on Knick's property.

The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause says that ""private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation."" Knick, who was exposed to cascading fines for resisting the township's ordinance, wished to challenge the ordinance as a taking. But because of a 1985 court ruling, she was confronted with what Chief Justice John Roberts last week called a ""Catch-22.""

That ruling held that before having access to federal courts, a plaintiff must first achieve a state court decision on the takings claims. But, wrote Roberts, if after the time and expense of the state process the plaintiff receives an adverse ruling there concerning just compensation, that ruling generally precludes a subsequent federal suit. So the court ruled 5-4 (Roberts with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in the majority) that the 1985 ruling should not stand as a burden on plaintiffs seeking a federal remedy for state infringements of their constitutional rights.

Writing for the minority (joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor), Elena Kagan, making what Roberts rightly termed “extreme assertions,” said the court’s decision “smashes a hundred-plus years of legal rulings to smithereens.” It does not, but suppose it did. What if those supposedly pertinent prior rulings — prior to 1985 — also were wrong?

A brief filed with the court on Knick's behalf by Washington's Cato Institute and others argued that the 1985 decision was an anomaly that effectively consigned ""Takings Clause claims to second-class status. No other individual constitutional rights claim is systematically excluded from federal court in the same way."" The post-Civil War 14th Amendment was enacted to secure federal rights for all citizens, which requires access to federal courts ""to vindicate their federal rights."" Congress wrote that amendment and other laws because, according to the brief, it worried that ""state courts could not be trusted to adequately enforce the federal Constitution against the coordinate branches of state government.""

In the court's long and often luminous history, there is no nobler episode than the protracted, piecemeal erosion — most dramatically, with the 1954 Brown decision concerning school desegregation — of the now completely overturned 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson precedent upholding the constitutionality of (supposedly) ""separate but equal"" segregated public facilities. Also, in 1943, in a 6-3 ruling, the court reversed an 8-1 ruling from just three years earlier that had upheld the constitutionality of laws requiring school pupils to salute the U.S. flag, regardless of deeply held religious objections to the practice.

More recently, the court has held (in 2003, when overturning a 1986 precedent upholding the constitutionality of anti-sodomy laws) that stare decisis is not an ""inexorable command."" Quite right. The inexorable command is to reason correctly so that justice is done, especially when constitutional rights are at stake.

“Fiat Justitia ruat caelum” is Latin for “Let justice be done though the heavens fall.” Perhaps that would not be prudent. However, when a flawed precedent falls, this is hardly equivalent to the heavens falling.

"Senate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals'",https://thehill.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450706-senate-vote-requires-military-epa-to-deal-with-harmful-forever,"The Senate passed a defense bill Thursday that would require an increased response from the government to harmful chemicals that have leached into water in at least 43 states.

Included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is language that would push the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a national drinking water standard for a class of chemicals known as PFAS that have been linked with cancer and other health problems.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to regulate the chemicals that are so persistent in the environment they’ve been deemed “forever chemicals.”

PFAS is used in a staggering number of products, including firefighting foam, which the bill directs the military to stop using.

A move by Congress to force a drinking water standard would be significant and ultimately require local governments to keep PFAS in water below a certain level. Currently, the EPA recommends water contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS, but many states, tired of waiting for the EPA, have set more stringent standards far below that figure.

The bill also directs the Department of Defense to take more aggressive action on PFAS following accusation that the Pentagon was trying to weaken EPA regulations that would force the military to take on expensive cleanup costs now estimated at around $2 billion.

The bill pushes the Pentagon to finalize agreements with states for cleaning up PFAS contamination caused by the military largely through the use of firefighting foam. The military would have three years to phase out use of the foam.

Other provisions would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

But the Senate version does not make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water, something Sen. Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperSenate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals' Hillicon Valley: Investigation finds federal agencies failed to address cyber vulnerabilities | Officials crack down on illegal robocallers | Warren offers plan to secure elections | Senators grill Google exec on 'persuasive technology' Senate investigation finds multiple federal agencies left sensitive data vulnerable to cyberattacks for past decade MORE (D-Del.) has been pushing for.

“The provisions we secured in this legislation will improve both the federal government’s understanding of and response to PFAS contamination. The Department of Defense’s use of firefighting foam containing PFAS is a significant source of this contamination,"" he said. ""The use of these chemicals in firefighting foam has undoubtedly saved lives, but the cruel irony is that those same life-saving chemicals can endanger lives when they wind up in a glass of drinking water.""

He added, ""While the provisions we included in this package are an important start, I am disappointed that we were unable to successfully include the legislation I introduced with Senator Capito that would designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, and I will continue to fight to ensure that important measure is enacted into law.”

Environmental groups hailed the bill as an important first step in dealing with the growing PFAS problem.

“The first step to addressing this catastrophe is knowing where PFAS pollution is coming from and understanding how far it has spread. This legislation will go a long way in doing just that. Much more needs to be done to address the crisis, but monitoring the scope of PFAS pollution will lay the groundwork for further progress,” Scott Faber, with the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement.

The Senate version also includes a number of other environmental measures, including funding for research into carbon capture."
USDA identifies unapproved GMO wheat growing wild in Washington,https://www.upi.com,['Jessie Higgins'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/27/USDA-identifies-unapproved-GMO-wheat-growing-wild-in-Washington/6441561660173/,"No genetically engineered wheat is approved for use in the United States. Photo by Alexandr Dobysh/Shutterstock

June 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the genetically modified, unapproved wheat found growing wild in Washington state as a grain created by Monsanto.

The wheat was genetically engineered to withstand the company's Roundup herbicide, which would allow farmers to better kill other plants without affecting their wheat crops. It's called Roundup Ready wheat.

The company also makes Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, both of which are approved by the USDA.

The wheat, also called MON 71800, does not have USDA approval -- no genetically engineered wheat is approved from commercial use anywhere in the world.

RELATED Unapproved GMO wheat found growing wild in Washington

Monsanto petitioned for its approval in 2002 and 2004, but chose to withdraw its applications before the agency issued a ruling, said Rick Coker, a USDA spokesman.

However, the Food and Drug Administration completed a ""voluntary consultation"" of MON 71800 in 2004, ""concluding that this GE wheat is as safe as food and feed as non-GE wheat currently on the market,"" Coker said.

The Roundup Ready wheat was found growing wild in eastern Washington state in early June in an area that was ""possibly on the site of a former [Monsanto] field trial,"" Charla Lord, a spokeswoman for Bayer, which recently purchased Monsanto, said shortly after it was found.

The USDA still is reviewing the situation, and anticipates the investigation will take between six and nine months, Coker said.

Bayer had no comment on the USDA's most recent findings. Shortly after the USDA announced the discovery June 7, the company issued the statement, ""We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation. We will provide more information when possible."""
Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Nancy Cook']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/dhs-chief-immigration-1557047,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo employment & immigration Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

"So deep in student debt, they're suing Betsy DeVos over delays in loan forgiveness",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Sarah Min'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/betsy-devos-former-students-sue-betsy-devos-and-department-of-education-over-loan-forgiveness-delays/,"Seven plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, alleging they're illegally stalling on processing more than 158,000 applications for student loan forgiveness.

Under the ""borrower defense"" rule, defrauded students can apply for loan relief if their schools were found to have misled them.

The Education Department blamed a constant stream of politicized litigation for any holds on processing claims.

Alicia Davis feels like she was scammed. As a student at Florida Metropolitan University from 2006 to 2008, she said she was told the cost of her online criminal justice program would be covered by Pell grants and scholarships. She was told her credits could be transferred to other schools. Graduating from the school, a subsidiary of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges, would lead to a job and a decent wage.

None of it was true, said Davis, who accrued more than $22,000 in student loans from FMU. The 36-year-old is now one of seven plaintiffs suing the U.S. Department of Education and its chief, Betsy DeVos, for allegedly failing to offer relief to more than 158,000 student-loan borrowers who claim they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.

""They pretty much sold me a lie and a dream,"" Davis told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Turns out pretty much all of it was a lie.""

More than 158,000 pending claims for loan forgiveness

Davis and her co-plaintiffs are pinning their lawsuit on the ""borrower defense"" rule, which allows students to apply for loan forgiveness if their schools were found to have misled them. The rule was expanded during the Obama administration after Corinthian Colleges collapsed in 2015, spotlighting widespread fraud at some for-profit schools. Over 200,000 former students have applied for loan cancellation since 2015 — and the suit says three-quarters of those claims are still pending.

Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending, which filed the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said the Department of Education has illegally halted processing forgiveness applications under DeVos's tenure, neither rejecting nor approving any claims. According to the complaint, the department ""intentionally adopted a policy of inaction and obfuscation."" The Education Department last approved a borrower-defense application in June 2018.

Financial tips for new college grads with student debt

""The Department of Education has knowingly enabled for-profit colleges to defraud students,"" Eileen Connor, legal director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, said in a statement. ""It recklessly continued to act as a loan broker for disreputable schools despite clear records of abuse and misconduct,"" Connor added.

The Harvard Law project, which also released an open call for testimonials from former for-profit students, said the online form received more than 200 submissions in 24 hours. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco.

Previously delayed

The Education Department disputes the allegations, saying it's ready to finalize borrower-defense claims when other pending litigation over student loans is resolved and the courts allow it to proceed. Department officials also blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of claims, saying it failed to put into place an effective process to review a flood of applications.

""The only thing stopping the Department from finalizing thousands of these claims is the constant stream of litigation brought by ideological, so-called student advocate special interests,"" spokeswoman Liz Hill said in a statement.

DeVos has been sued before for her stance on the Obama-era borrower-defense policy, which she tried to delay from being implemented in 2017, saying it too easily allows students to ""raise his or her hand"" to get ""free money."" A federal judge ruled against the delay last September, finding it unlawful and calling it ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Instead, DeVos rolled out a more restrictive tiered relief system in December to partially compensate defrauded students based on their earnings. The plan has been frozen as part of a separate lawsuit.

Key issue in 2020

The latest lawsuit against DeVos has already won praise among dozens of progressive groups and Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted her support Tuesday saying, ""If she doesn't care about helping defrauded students, then let's hope a federal judge will make her care.""

I’m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn’t care about helping defrauded students, then let’s hope a federal judge will make her care. https://t.co/nJp0mwbw4S — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 25, 2019

The lawsuit comes as student loan debt becomes a key issue on the presidential campaign trail. Both Senators Warren and Bernie Sanders announced plans to forgive student loan debt, which has climbed to nearly $1.6 trillion nationwide for 44 million Americans. While proposing different solutions, both presidential candidates seek to erase a burden making it difficult for Americans to reach traditional milestones, like owning a home or a car or starting a family.

U.S. Reps. Susie Lee and Rosa DeLauro released joint legislation Wednesday to improve protections of students, including veterans, at for-profit colleges, including bolstering and enforcing borrower defense against repayment.

Today, along w/@Rosa_DeLauro, I introduced the PROTECT Students Act to finally give student protections from #4profit colleges.@BetsyDevosED has rolled back for-profit oversight, leaving students open to all kinds of predatory practices. No more. Let's put our students first. — Rep. Susie Lee (@RepSusieLee) June 26, 2019

Davis, with her $22,000 in federal loans to attend FMU, said she had to start her education over from scratch after learning her college credits weren't transferable and her certifications were not recognized. She went on to amass an additional $75,000 in loans to get her bachelor's and master's degrees and is now a crime analyst at a law enforcement agency.

But Davis, an Orlando resident, said her time at FMU continues to dog her in other ways: Even after establishing a borrower-defense claim in 2016, she received notices from the U.S. Department of Education threatening to garnish her wages. Having defaulted on her FMU loans at that time, she has had to explain her poor credit score to employers before any hiring offer. It has also prevented her from buying a car.

She hopes her suit can help others who may feel embarrassed or ashamed to move forward: ""Then we can do the next step and close this next part of our lives and hopefully recover financially, emotionally and become stable,"" she said."

In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would be interested in attending the Presidents Cup in Melbourne, ahead of a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the sidelines of the G20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan.

Asked by a reporter if he would go to the premier golfing event, Trump, an avid golfer, said he wanted to but was noncommittal.

“I’ll tell you what - I’d like to,” Trump said. “It might not be easy, but I’d like to.”

Morrison offered Trump a “warm invitation” to the major golfing event, scheduled in early December.

Citing administration officials, the Times reported that Mnuchin has been lobbying President Donald Trump, who has signaled that he supports the idea of handing control of the agency back to Treasury.

Mnuchin held talks this month about the move with senior Secret Service agents at the Treasury Department, the Times reported.

Mnuchin has been interested in the agency's cybersecurity and anticounterfeiting work, according to the Times.

Some senior DHS officials oppose the move, concerned about losing an agency with those components, the Times reports.

FedEx sues the US government over Huawei ban confusion,https://www.theinquirer.net,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3077964/fedex-sues-us-gov-over-huawei-ban-confusion,"FedEx is lining up to take on the US government

PARCEL FLINGER FedEx has launched a lawsuit against the US government arguing that it isn't its place to screen packages for products banned under export rules.

The suit was filed in the aftermath of an incident which saw a number of packages containing Huawei devices 'mishandled' by the company, with one unit actually refused for delivery.

FedEx has argued that its 'common carrier rights' have been breached by being forced to assume liability for handling packages covered by laws such as the recent White House Executive Order which effectively bans Huawei from the US.

In a message to the Department of Commerce, FedEx argued that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers.""

In one specific incident, a UK tech journalist sent a Huawei handset to colleagues in the US via FedEx, only to have it returned due to ""a government issue"". FedEx later admitted it had made an error by refusing.

Meanwhile, Bejing authorities also began investigating FedEx after two packages bound for China were diverted to the US.

In a statement, the company said: ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" whilst the lawsuit argues that the rules ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"".

A US government spokesman said: ""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"".

FedEx has said that Huawei is just one significant example of a wider issue for carriers in the 21st century. It also demonstrates just how unclear the rules over Huawei's US ban actually are, and they don't seem to be getting much clearer. μ"
William Barr pipes in talk of national priorities at the DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bill-barr-pipes-in-talk-of-national-priorities-at-doj,"Attorney General William Barr surprised the crowd gathered at the Justice Department on Wednesday when he jumped out of his seat and grabbed a set of bagpipes to join the Emerald Society Pipe Band in a rousing rendition of Scotland the Brave.



Attorney General Barr speaks to gathering of U.S. attorneys at the @TheJusticeDept.



When the @NYPDnews Bagpipe Band is playing, you can see Barr sneak off stage.



He walks back on stage from behind the curtains with big surprise for audience: pic.twitter.com/z5bxwcss7L — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) June 26, 2019



It was a moment of levity for the controversial attorney general as he kicked off the U.S. Attorneys' Conference.

When Barr got up to the podium, he briefly diverted from his prepared remarks, saying that his colleagues at the DOJ had tried to surprise him with bagpipers, but that he'd figured it out. ""But as you know, I’m very proficient at, dare I say the word, spying,” Barr said. “And I discovered the plot. So this was my counter surprise.”

Barr famously told a Senate committee earlier this year that referred to some of the surveillance actions taken by the U.S. government during the Trump-Russia investigation as “spying did occur” while speaking in front of a Senate committee in April, and despite criticism from many Democrats, Barr has repeatedly defended his use of the term since then, calling it “a good English word.”

Barr said today was the first time he’d played the bagpipes since performing at his daughter’s wedding late last year.

He recounted that Trump called him up in early December, saying Trump told him that he was about to jump on a helicopter and wanted to move up the announcement of his appointment as attorney general on a whim so he could tell the reporters on the way out.

“So sure enough, as my first out-of-body experience, and there have been a lot since then, but I turn on the TV and there he is announcing me as attorney general,” Barr said.

The attorney general also talked about the challenges the DOJ faces.

“On the one hand, the department’s law enforcement efforts are at their all-time best,"" Barr said. ""On the other hand, the threats we face are greater and more complex than ever.”

Barr said that he was particularly focused on violent crimes, dangers posed to federal law enforcement officials, transnational gangs, national security threats, and the crisis on the southern border.

Barr also said he was worried about hate crimes, saying he was “deeply concerned” about the “rise that we have seen over the past decade” and made it clear that we “must have zero tolerance for violence that is motivated by hatred against their fellow citizens, whether on the basis of their racial, religious, or sexual characteristics.”

Barr pointed to illegal drugs as another growing threat, knocking the Obama administration for not being aggressive enough and saying that “a tsunami was allowed to build up which is now hitting the country.” Barr said that “when I look at the overdose deaths, the blighted lives, and the families and communities broken by drug addiction, it reminds me why we cannot surrender.”

And Barr weighed in on the immigration controversy, saying that “a lasting solution will involve changing our laws, but in the meanwhile we must do all we can to support DHS.” Barr also said that “even if we devoted every AUSA in the country to those cases, we could not solve the crisis on the southern border through prosecutions alone” and said he hoped that more immigration judges and Trump’s recent agreement with Mexico would help solve the issue.

“Much of what we’re trying to do is make up ground that we’ve lost as a result of inattention in the past,” Barr told the crowd. “And I assure you with sustained efforts and firm resolve we will make up this ground and surmount these challenges.”

Barr did not comment on Robert Mueller agreeing to testify in July nor did he mention his ongoing investigation into the origin of the Trump-Russia probe."
"Treasury Department watchdog to investigate delays on Harriet Tubman $20 bill - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/treasury-department-watchdog-investigate-delays-harriet-tubman-20-bill-2019-jun,"The U.S. Treasury's watchdog says it will look into why the redesign of the $20 bill featuring abolitionist Harriet Tubman was delayed.

The Office of the Inspector General said in a letter on Friday to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that it will consider the matter as part of an audit that is about to begin. The Senate minority leader had asked the inspector general's office earlier this month to investigate the circumstances surrounding the decision to delay the redesign ""including any involvement by the White House.""

The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled to coincide with the 100th anniversary in 2020 of passage of the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month that it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited. He said those bills will now be introduced before a redesigned $20 bill.

The decision to put Tubman on the $20 bill had been made by Mnuchin's predecessor, former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who had served in the Obama administration.

The Office of the Inspector General said it will be looking into whether security measures are properly being implemented into currency, among other measures. As part of that audit it will specifically include a review of the process with the $20 bill. The effort is expected to take 10 months, according to the letter.

Schumer said he is pleased the matter will be reviewed quickly.

""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population ... the $20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that disparity, and rectify it,"" he said in a statement.

Schumer said the Trump administration's decision to delay the new note ""has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""

The Treasury did not respond to a request for further comment."

SoilWeb App 2.0 Offers Valuable Soil Info on the Go,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Tammy Cheever', 'Dee Ann Littlefield', 'Usda Nrcs In']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/26/soilweb-app-20-offers-valuable-soil-info-go,"Technology Posted by Tammy Cheever and Dee Ann Littlefield, USDA NRCS in Conservation

SoilWeb brings multiple soil data sources together to provide key soil-related information on the go.

Have you ever wondered about the soil you are standing on, at any given spot in the United States? Curious about what soil type it is? How about if the soil is easy to dig? If the soil is ideal for supporting the weight of a house or a barn? Or simply, if it will help you grow better tomatoes?

Thanks to an innovative mobile app, the world’s largest soil survey data base is available on the go. The USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the University of California at Davis recently announced that the SoilWeb app, version 2.0, is available as a free download from Google Play (Android) and the Apple app store (iOS). The app was created through a partnership between NRCS and UC Davis.

With its embedded GPS system, SoilWeb provides convenient, instantaneous soil information from the exact soil the user is standing on. The app gives users greater accessibility to NRCS’ soil survey information that has been collected across the United States since the late 1890s. The app presents the data in mobile form, helping users make better-informed decisions about the location they are researching.

A soil sample with a sharp shooter can provide a real life visual of the soil profile image detailed in the SoilWeb app.

The information can inform insurers about flooding frequency and builders about if the location could be suitable for roads, basements, or septic tanks. The agricultural real estate industry, farmland owners, and farmers interested in renting or purchasing land commonly need information about soil productivity and land capability. Knowledge of soil is also important to home gardeners and landscapers. Although soil survey information can be used for general farm, local, and wider area planning, a professional onsite evaluation is needed to supplement this information in some cases.

Location accuracy settings allow users to select between standard accuracy (less accurate and uses less battery power) and high accuracy (more accurate but may use more battery power). The location auto-refresh feature allows users to access soil maps and data real-time even as they travel about their property.

Users can simply click “Get Soil Data” on the app’s home screen and get detailed soil survey data for that spot. Furthermore, they can get information on soil taxonomy, soil series descriptions, soil property depth profiles, land classification ratings, hydraulic and erosion ratings, forest productivity, and soil suitability ratings.

The “Details” tab in the soil series description offers robust site information indicating if the site is a good location for a pond as determined by slope and water-holding capacity. This feature can also determine if site is suitable for cropland, including the type of crops it is best suited for and even the types of plants one could expect to find at that location – from trees to forbs to grasses. This is especially helpful for long range management plans for the property.

Soil suitability ratings provide customer reports based on a user’s interest. Categories include agriculture, forestry, engineering, irrigation, urban/recreation, soil contamination awareness, and wildlife. This portion of the app displays what the soil could be best suited for and provides information on how to manage the land for best productivity.

The app was developed by NRCS Soil Scientist Dylan Beaudette, in 2010 when Beaudette was a Ph.D. student at UC Davis, along with Anthony O'Geen, UC Davis professor and Cooperative Extension specialist. Through an agreement between NRCS and UC Davis, contractor Mike Walkinshaw was able to devote the last 12 months to bringing the app up to current standards with new features. The app accesses NRCS’ Web Soil Survey information, with is an accumulation of valuable soil information the agency has been collecting since the 1890s.

When producers look out across their fields and pastures, they have a good idea of what is growing above the ground. But it is soil underneath that really drives their management systems. The better farmers and ranchers understand the soils beneath their land, the more they can improve the production capability on their land.

The SoilWeb app offers this and more from the convenience and ease of a mobile device. Download it today. It’s free and we know it will become an important tool in your farming toolbox.

SoilWeb app offers detailed information about plants likely to be found in the area, offering a great opportunity for landowners to do a pasture walk and plant identification."
"Border official resigns amid uproar over migrant children - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/border-official-resigns-amid-uproar-over-migrant-children-2019-jun,"HOUSTON (AP) — The acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection resigned Tuesday amid an uproar over the discovery of migrant children being held in pitiful conditions at one of the agency's stations in Texas.

Acting Commissioner John Sanders' departure deepened the sense of crisis and added to the rapid turnover inside the agencies responsible for enforcing President Donald Trump's hardline immigration priorities as the U.S. deals with record numbers of migrant families coming across the border.

In a message to employees, Sanders said he would step down on July 5. He did not give a reason for leaving.

Advertisement - Story continues below

""Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career,"" he said.

Hours after Sanders' departure became public, two officials told The Associated Press that he was being replaced by Mark Morgan, who was named acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement just last month. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the move and declined to be identified.

In an interview last week, Sanders blamed the problems in detention on a lack of money. He called on Congress to pass a $4.5 billion emergency funding bill to address the crisis — legislation the House was planning to take up Tuesday.

At the White House, Trump said that he did not ask for Sanders' resignation — adding that he doesn't think he has ever spoken to the man — but that he is ""moving some people around into different locations"" amid the crisis.

While activists welcomed Sanders' departure, Trump defended U.S. border authorities, saying, ""The laws are so bad and the asylum rules and laws are so bad that our Border Patrol people, who are so incredible, aren't allowed to do their jobs.""

The unprecedented surge of migrant families has left U.S. immigration detention centers severely overcrowded and taxed the government's ability to provide medical care and other attention. Six children have died since September after being detained by border agents.

After he was picked to lead ICE, Morgan, the new acting director, showed a willingness to deport families during enforcement sweeps. However, past Trump immigration officials hesitated over concerns about logistics and the public's reaction.

The Trump administration has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days over conditions inside the Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, first reported by The Associated Press: inadequate food, lack of medical care, no soap, and older children trying to care for toddlers.

In one case reported in Clint, attorneys said a 2-year-old boy without a diaper was being watched by older children. Several youngsters had the flu. Many were separated from extended family members like aunts and uncles who brought them to the border; others were teenage mothers with babies.

As word of the children's plight got out, people moved by their stories started showing up the station's doors to donate boxes of diapers and even a Cookie Monster stuffed toy. They were not allowed in the building. Customs and Border Protection says it has enough supplies, but was checking with lawyers to see if it could accept donated items.

An official from Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that the majority of the roughly 300 children detained at Clint last week had been moved to facilities operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, wouldn't say exactly how many.

But around the same time Sanders announced his resignation, his agency said officials had moved more than 100 children back to the station.

The human costs of the migrant surge were driven home this week by a searing photo of the bodies of a Salvadoran man and his nearly 2-year-old daughter, face down in shallow water along the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. On Sunday, two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead on the Texas side, overcome by the sweltering heat.

Trump said he is ""very concerned"" about conditions at the border but claimed without evidence that things are ""much better than they were under President Obama, by far"" and in ""much better shape than it ever was"" — an assertion immigration activists said is simply not true.

""We did not have the kind of overcrowded conditions for unaccompanied kids in Border Patrol holding cells like we saw in Clint,"" said Michael Bochenek, a lawyer from Human Rights Watch.

Previously CBP's chief operating officer, Sanders was named acting commissioner in April after the agency's previous leader, Kevin McAleenan, became acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Other key DHS agencies also have interim or acting directors, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Morgan, who also served as chief of the Border Patrol, a subsidiary of CBP, under President Barack Obama, is now expected to be replaced as ICE's acting leader by Matthew Albence. Albence served as acting director earlier this year after the departure of another former leader, Ronald Vitiello.

ICE on Saturday delayed an operation to sweep U.S. cities and arrest hundreds of people accused of flouting orders to leave the country, days after Trump tweeted about the upcoming crackdown. Former ICE acting director Thomas Homan, a Trump administration ally, then went on television to accuse McAleenan of leaking information about the operation because he opposed it.

CBP is the agency that apprehends and first detains migrant parents and children crossing the Mexican border.

CBP's facilities at the border were almost all built when most people crossing into the U.S. illegally were single adults. Now, the agency is apprehending tens of thousands of parents and children weekly. It recorded 84,500 apprehensions of adults and children traveling together in May.

In the wake of Sanders' resignation, Democratic Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, lashed out at the administration's immigration policies and ""bad actors in the White House.""

""There is simply no excuse for the horrific conditions children and families are being held in at the border,"" he said.

Jennifer Quigley, director of refugee advocacy for Human Rights First, called on Congress to hold hearings on the youngsters' treatment.

""Trump administration officials need to be held accountable for the disgraceful response to the situation at the border,"" she said in a statement. ""This is only the tip of the iceberg. We need a full accounting of how children came to be caged in filthy and unsafe conditions."""

Catherine Rampell: Those aren’t the emails we should be looking for,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Catherine Rampell', 'The Washington Post']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/25/catherine-rampell-those/,"President Trump would like to make someone’s email a central issue in the 2020 election, just as it was in 2016.

I’m on board — though I disagree with which someone we’re talking about.

We should be laser-focused on newly discovered private emails between a high-ranking census official and a GOP operative, and what they reveal about a long-term Republican conspiracy to rip political representation and financial resources from Democrats and people of color.

Thanks to recent court filings, we've learned that the late Thomas Hofeller, a Republican strategist and gerrymandering savant, helped devise a scheme to rig the political system in favor of his party for years, perhaps decades. The plan hinged on an innocuous-sounding addition to the decennial census — a new question about citizenship.

Adding this question could help Republicans in two ways. First has to do with how legislative districts are drawn.

The Constitution says federal congressional seats must be apportioned by total population, but states have some leeway in how they draw their state and local legislative districts. Currently, they generally do so based on equally sized groups of people, as measured by total population. As Hofeller described in a secret 2015 study, data from a census citizenship question could instead help states draw districts around the citizen voting-age population.

Redrawing the legislative map this new way, the study concludes, would dilute the political power of Democrats and Hispanics and ""be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

Second, adding a citizenship question would likely make households with immigrants or ethnic minorities much less likely to participate in the census at all.

Sure, filling out the decennial census is mandatory, and census data must legally be kept confidential. But these groups have reason to worry about how their information would be used, given how the current president has demonized and threatened to deport them.

In unrelated 2017 survey testing, respondents expressed fears that immigration authorities might come after them or other members of their households; some worried about the ""Muslim ban""; some offered fake names and birth dates.

Those fears are likely to worsen if every household is asked to report on the citizenship status of every occupant. A new paper from career U.S. Census Bureau officials estimated that, if the question were added, the census self-response rate for households with at least one noncitizen would be eight percentage points lower than for all-citizen households, all else equal.

Article continues below

The end result is that public officials wouldn't have to pretend these people don't exist when they draw electoral maps, as with the proposed switch from total population to citizen voting-age population (a change that might get blocked in courts anyway).

According to official census records, they actually wouldn’t exist, period.

That would mean fewer congressional seats for, say, California, regardless of how the legislative map within California got drawn. It would also mean fewer federal funds for areas with large immigrant or ethnic-minority populations, as census data helps determine how hundreds of billions of dollars get allocated each year.

Hofeller's unpublished study would have remained secret had his estranged daughter not recently discovered his old hard drives and given them to a voting-rights group. These materials showed that portions of the 2017 Justice Department letter that provided the supposed legal rationale for adding a citizenship question — an obviously bogus explanation involving the Voting Rights Act — were taken verbatim from Hofeller's study.

Faced with this new electronic paper trail, which appeared to contradict statements administration officials had made under oath, the administration at first appeared indignant. It improbably claimed there was no evidence that there was even a connection between the Hofeller study and the Census Bureau.

And then, in another recent court filing, plaintiffs challenging the citizenship question dropped another bombshell: Hofeller had been emailing with Christa Jones, now the chief of staff to the deputy director at census. For years.

The messages show that Jones, while a census employee, communicated with Hofeller from both her government email and a separate private account about census-related and redistricting issues since at least 2010. At one point, shortly before the 2015 study was done, she specifically flagged a Federal Register notice for comment on the Census Bureau's 2015 Content Test, saying that it could ""be an opportunity to mention citizenship.""

The Supreme Court heard a challenge to the citizenship question this spring — before these Hofeller bombshells dropped — and a decision about its legality is expected this week. Given these lies, damned lies and (would-be) statistics, the court should have little choice but to block this tainted question from being asked.

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."

Trump’s Feud With the Fed Is Rooted in Presidential History,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeanna Smialek'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/business/economy/federal-reserve-trump.html,"December 2018

Chatter about firing the Fed chair

“I think he put out a tweet last night specifically saying he now realizes he does not have the authority to fire.” — Mick Mulvaney, who had recently been named the acting White House chief of staff, on ABC

That fourth rate increase fueled Mr. Trump’s ire and the president privately talked about firing Mr. Powell, telling advisers that the Fed chair would “turn me into Hoover,” a reference to the Great Depression-era president.

Spring 2019

Envisioning an economic ‘rocket ship’

“China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‘match,’ it would be game over, we win!” — Mr. Trump, on Twitter

With his re-election campaign looming, Mr. Trump has increasingly focused on the strength of the economy and portrayed the Fed as the skunk at a garden party. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the economy would take off like a “rocket ship” if not for Mr. Powell and that the stock market could be 5,000 to 10,000 points higher if the Fed had done its job “properly.” He has urged the Fed to start cutting rates, saying it is putting America at a disadvantage relative to its trading partners, like China and Europe.

June 2019

A potential demotion for the Fed chair, instead

“We’ll see what happens; they’re going to be making an announcement pretty soon, so we’ll see what happens.”— Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters about whether he would try to demote Mr. Powell

On the eve of a major Fed meeting, Bloomberg reported that the White House had looked into the legality of stripping Mr. Powell of his chair title and demoting him to a governor. The president himself seemed to imply that it was a possibility while talking with reporters on June 18. After the Fed’s June 19 meeting, at which the central bank signaled that rate cuts could be coming soon, Mr. Trump repeated in a television interview that he was unhappy with the Fed but said he had never suggested demoting Mr. Powell — though he said he believes he has the authority to do so.

The Past

A legacy of Fed bashing

“I was stunned. Not only was the president clearly overstepping his authority by giving an order to the Fed, but also it was disconcerting because I wasn’t planning tighter monetary policy at the time.” — Paul A. Volcker, former Fed chair, in his memoir “Keeping at It”

Other presidents have also seen the Fed as their nemesis.

By lifting rates, the central bank restrains economic growth in hopes of making it more sustainable into the future. Politicians, focused on their legacies and re-elections, do not like it when that happens on their watch.

Lyndon B. Johnson famously warred with his Fed chair, William McChesney Martin Jr. By some accounts, he pushed Mr. Martin against a wall at his Texas ranch and dressed him down over monetary policy at one contentious meeting in 1965.

Richard M. Nixon also pressured Mr. Martin’s successor, Arthur Burns, to keep rates low. The White House had its way, and many economists partly blame the Fed’s capitulation for the runaway inflation of the 1970s.

Mr. Volcker, who was the Fed chair from 1979 to 1987, said in his recent memoir that during a 1984 White House meeting with Ronald Reagan and James A. Baker III, then the chief of staff, Mr. Baker declared that “the president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election.” Mr. Volcker, who had not planned on raising rates and found the attack to be an overstep, walked out without replying."
"Acting ICE director: Detailed leak about planned raids was 'egregious,' put agents' lives at risk",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-ice-director-mark-morgan-leak-raids-egregious,"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Mark Morgan said Tuesday that the detailed leak about planned ICE raids last week was ""egregious"" and placed agents' lives ""at risk.""

Morgan was asked on ""Fox & Friends"" about a report that Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan leaked the plans and ordered him to call off an operation that was expected to target 2,000 families living illegally in up to 10 cities across the country.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

Morgan declined to address the alleged stand-down order from McAleenan, saying it would not be ""appropriate"" for him to talk about ""privileged"" discussions with McAleenan or the White House.

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

""Detailed information about the operation was leaked and that's egregious. The operation was compromised and when that happens, the lives of agents and officers are absolutely put at risk,"" said Morgan.

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April — prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up — and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

McAleenan's office vehemently denied the accusation, saying through a spokesperson to ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan has never leaked anything in his 18-year career.

""That's exactly what I've heard ... that the acting secretary has denied that the leaks came from him,"" said Morgan.

"Utah Sens. Mike Lee, Mitt Romney looking to involve EPA earlier in local pollution prevention plans",https://www.ksl.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Jun']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46582502/utah-sens-mike-lee-mitt-romney-looking-to-involve-epa-earlier-in-local-pollution-prevention-plans,"SALT LAKE CITY — Utah's two senators have introduced legislation to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to work with local governments to lower pollution before they violate the Clean Air Act.

Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Mitt Romney say the Early Action Against Ozone Act would let local communities work with the EPA before ozone levels reach unhealthy levels.

""Local governments that want to work with the EPA to lower pollution shouldn’t have to wait till pollution is already a problem in their communities before they are credited for reducing emissions,” Lee said.

Romney said that under current law, the EPA can only work with local governments when ozone levels have become elevated.

""Our bill will authorize the EPA to engage in partnerships with those local communities which are at risk of elevated ozone emissions before those unhealthy levels have been reached,"" he said.

In 2002, the EPA started the Early Action Compact Program to give communities at risk of violating the EPA’s ozone standards the option of entering into a cooperative agreement with the agency before they actually violated the standards.

Thirteen of 14 areas that voluntarily entered the program improved air quality and avoided a “non-attainment” designation, according to the senators.

EPA scrapped the program in 2017 due to ligation, which argued that the program was outside EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

The senators said their bill would give clear authorization and direct the EPA to implement a similar program to the so that other areas throughout the country can have the option of taking early action to improve air quality."

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

Story Continued Below

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

The Trump Administration’s attempts to suppress climate science are unacceptable. This isn’t a political game — this is the livelihoods and futures of farmers & ranchers across the country.



We need answers. That’s why I will be calling on @USDA to release the science. https://t.co/Urzj7z0wAn — Michael Bennet (@SenatorBennet) June 24, 2019

""Our farmers and ranchers know as well as anyone the devastating effects of climate change, because they're living with the realities of droughts in places like Colorado and floods in places like Iowa,"" he said.

Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur, tweeted the story soon after it posted Sunday evening: ""Suppressing scientific research and findings is the opposite of what we should be doing.""
