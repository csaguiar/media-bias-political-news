Trump declares victory over ‘Deep State’ as court tosses challenge over his businesses,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-declares-victory-over-deep-state-after-court-tosses-case-over-businesses,"President Trump scored a big win on Wednesday when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to throw out a case that accused him of violating the Constitution through earnings from D.C. businesses including the Trump International Hotel.

The lawsuit, brought by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C., claimed that earnings from the hotel and its related businesses violated prohibitions against receiving benefits from foreign governments, the U.S., or individual states. The Fourth Circuit declared that Maryland and D.C. lacked standing to bring the case in the first place, and ordered the lower court to dismiss the complaint.

DOJ FILES TO HALT TRUMP SUIT DEMANDING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS

“Word just out that I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “Unanimous decision in my favor from The United States Court of Appeals For The Fourth Circuit on the ridiculous Emoluments Case. I don’t make money, but lose a fortune for the honor of serving and doing a great job as your President (including accepting Zero salary!).”

The complaint claimed that by maintaining ownership of his businesses, Trump earned “millions of dollars in payments, benefits, and other valuable consideration from foreign governments and persons acting on their behalf, as well as federal agencies and state governments.” The Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits people holding office from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state” without congressional consent.

Similarly, the Domestic Emoluments Clause says that the president “shall not receive … any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them” other than a salary.

The Fourth Circuit ruled that D.C. and Maryland could not properly bring such a case against Trump because they did not establish that they suffered any harm that justified the lawsuit. They claimed that their interest was in protecting local businesses that allegedly lost out on business because officials would patronize Trump’s establishments instead. They also claimed that the Trump International Hotel has an “unlawful competitive advantage” over D.C. properties and that Maryland loses out on tax revenue because business is going to Trump’s D.C. businesses instead.

The Fourth Circuit did not buy these arguments.

“The District and Maryland’s interest in enforcing the Emoluments Clauses is so attenuated and abstract that their prosecution of this case readily provokes the question of whether this action against the President is an appropriate use of the courts, which were created to resolve real cases and controversies between the parties,” the court’s opinion said, noting that the “alleged harm amounts to little more than a general interest in having the law followed,” which is not enough to constitute an actual case or controversy to be heard by the courts.

CUOMO SIGNS BILL ALLOWING CONGRESS TO GET TRUMP TAX RETURNS

""We are pleased that the Fourth Circuit unanimously decided to dismiss this extraordinarily flawed case,"" Justice Department spokesperson Kelly Laco said in a statement. ""The court correctly determined that the plaintiffs improperly asked the courts to exceed their constitutional role by reviewing the President’s compliance with the Emoluments Clauses.”

Trump’s personal attorney Jay Sekulow celebrated the outcome as “a complete victory.”

“The decision states that there was no legal standing to bring this lawsuit in the first place,” Sekulow said in a statement. “This latest effort at Presidential harassment has been dismissed with.”

D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a joint statement that they ""will continue to pursue our legal options,"" and that they believe the Fourth Circuit got it wrong.

""Although the court described a litany of ways in which this case is unique, it failed to acknowledge the most extraordinary circumstance of all: President Trump is brazenly profiting from the Office of the President in ways that no other President in history ever imagined and that the founders expressly sought—in the Constitution—to prohibit,"" the statement said. ""We have not and will not abandon our efforts to hold President Trump accountable for violating the Nation’s original anti-corruption laws.""

According to Bloomberg, the profits the Trump Organization as a whole earned from foreign countries and officials over the past year amounted to $191,538, an increase of 26 percent from the year before. The Organization, the operation of which Trump left to his children when he took office, donated that same amount to the U.S. Treasury to avoid Emoluments Clause concerns.

On Monday, the Justice Department filed a challenge in a separate Emoluments Clause case with the D.C. Court of Appeals. That case, brought by congressional Democrats, involved Trump properties including hotels in New York and D.C., as well as Mar-a-Lago in Florida. The DOJ's filing seeks the dismissal of the case, or at least a halt to the discovery process that would involve turning over various business records.

Home Depot Responds To Calls For Boycott Over Co-Founder's Support For Trump,https://www.npr.org,['Amy Held'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740173176/home-depot-responds-to-calls-for-boycott-over-co-founders-support-for-trump,"Home Depot Responds To Calls For Boycott Over Co-Founder's Support For Trump

Facing a backlash, Home Depot sought to distance itself from billionaire co-founder Bernie Marcus after he pledged to back President Trump's bid for re-election in 2020.

Calls to boycott the retailer took off this week on social media as news spread that Marcus told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late last month that he plans to support Trump's bid for another term.

""If you plan on buying a hammer, wood, or ANY home improvement items from Home Depot, you may as well send donations DIRECTLY to trump's 2020 campaign,"" read one tweet under the hashtag #BoycottHomeDepot.

Home Depot spokeswoman Margaret Smith said in a statement to NPR that Marcus retired more than a decade ago and is not speaking on behalf of the company. ""In fact, as a standard practice, the company does not endorse Presidential candidates,"" she said.

It was unclear Wednesday whether the calls for a boycott had gained traction.

But the threat was enough that Trump took to Twitter to express support for Marcus, whom he called a ""patriotic & charitable man,"" and to rail against the boycott, which he said was led by people who are ""vicious and totally crazed.""

""More and more the Radical Left is using Commerce to hurt their 'Enemy.' They put out the name of a store, brand or company, and ask their so-called followers not to do business there,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""They don't care who gets hurt, but also don't understand that two can play that game!""

Indeed, Trump himself has often used boycotts as a means of leverage. Just last month, he urged his more than 60 million Twitter followers to boycott AT&T, apparently in retribution for the coverage of him by its subsidiary CNN.

""I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway,"" the president tweeted on June 3. ""It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn't they act.""

Over the years, Trump has asked consumers to shun several U.S. entities.

Among the boycotts Trump has endorsed: Macy's after the retailer cut ties with the then-presidential candidate over controversial remarks about immigrants from Mexico, Harley-Davidson over a plan to move some of its production overseas and NFL games over player protests during the national anthem.

Many people on social media were quick to express their support of Trump and Home Depot.

""Ridiculous,"" was how one person characterized the boycott calls in a tweet. ""I'm heading out tomorrow to shop my heart out at their store. Thank you Home Depot for supporting President Trump.""

In his interview with the Journal-Constitution, Marcus said that while Trump ""sucks"" at communication, the president has ""got a businessman's common sense approach to most things.""

Marcus's support of Trump is not new. The 90-year-old donated more than $7 million to Trump's 2016 presidential run, according to OpenSecrets, a project of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Forbes estimates Marcus's net worth at $5.9 billion. He told the Journal-Constitution that he has given away some $2 billion to philanthropic causes worldwide and plans to donate the bulk of his wealth after his death."

Mueller III’s deputies from testifying before Congress, potentially jeopardizing an agreement for two of the former prosecutors to answer lawmakers’ questions in private next week, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

The department told the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees last week that it was opposed to the testimony and had communicated its view to the two former members of Mr. Mueller’s team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the discussions. A Justice Department official confirmed that account and said that the department had instructed both men not to appear.

It is unclear what effect the Justice Department’s intervention will have on the men’s eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel.

Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department’s view — depending on how strongly it is expressed — could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying."
Rep. Nunes on Christopher Steele's grilling by DOJ investigators: A lot of the dossier 'was just made up',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-christopher-steele-dossier-fbi-questioning,"Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday he believes the public will soon see that much of the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was ""made up.""

According to a New York Times report, FBI officials questioned one of Steele's sources and ""came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Mr. Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.""

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Reacting on ""Fox News @ Night,"" Nunes, R-Calif., said Steele refused to talk to the House Intelligence Committee while he served as chairman in 2017 and 2018.

""This is a man who made up this entire document. As you're starting to see it's unraveling, his sources are not real or if they are real they're second and third hand. So a lot of this is just made up out of whole cloth,"" said Nunes.

Shannon Bream then asked Nunes about a Politico report which suggested Steele's 16-hour grilling led to ""new and important information"" and could therefore ""dampen expectations among the president's allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

Nunes scoffed at that notion, saying either Steele had credible sources or he did not.

""The fact remains that they used that garbage that was paid for by a political campaign before a court,"" said Nunes, adding that there is information that is ""equally as bad or worse"" that has not been made public about Steele's work."

"Teen migrant claims Border Patrol agent sexually assaulted her, sparking federal investigation",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Meagan Flynn', 'Morning Mix Reporter', 'July At Am', ""Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team. She Was Previously A Reporter At The Houston Chronicle"", 'The Houston Press.']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/07/10/teen-migrants-allegations-sexual-assault-by-arizona-border-agent-sparks-federal-investigation/,"

An overcrowded area holds families at a Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Tex., on June 11. (Office of Inspector General/DHS/Reuters) (Handout/Reuters)

Authorities are investigating a complaint from a 15-year-old migrant girl that a U.S. border agent sexually assaulted her while she was detained in a facility in Yuma, Ariz., Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday night.

The allegations are contained in an internal report obtained by NBC News. The teenager from Honduras said a CBP officer put his hands inside her bra, pulled down her underwear and groped her, under the guise of a routine pat-down search, NBC reported. She reported he was laughing with the other guards in plain view of other migrants, leading her to feel embarrassed.

A spokesman for CBP confirmed in a statement to The Washington Post that the complaint is under investigation, along with other claims of mistreatment and retaliation against children contained in the incident reports compiled by Department of Health and Human Services case managers and cited by NBC.

“The allegations do not align with common practice at our facilities and will be fully investigated,” the CBP spokesman said. “It’s important to note that the allegation of sexual assault is already under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General.”

The latest allegations of mistreatment of child migrants come as CBP’s overcrowded detention facilities face mounting scrutiny, with detained children describing awful experiences ranging from a lack of basic hygiene products to being forced to sleep on a concrete floor. Although border arrests fell 28 percent in June, DHS officials said the situation in the region remained an “acute and worsening crisis.” On Monday, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said she was “deeply shocked” by the conditions.

[U.N. human rights chief ‘deeply shocked’ by migrant detention center conditions in Texas]

The allegations contained in the HHS incident reports cited by NBC, however, go beyond poor conditions caused by overcrowding and describe alleged deliberate mistreatment by CBP agents. Children described feeling afraid to ask for anything because agents would punish them for complaining. Others said guards hurled derogatory language at them, calling some “puto,” an anti-gay slur in Spanish, while giving orders, NBC reported. One boy said he wore soiled underwear for 10 days because he feared asking for a clean pair. A 16-year-old Guatemalan boy said agents took away mats from him and the other boys in his cell after they complained about the food and water. Instead, they slept on the bare concrete, NBC reported.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told the news outlet the “very concerning” allegations “need to be fully investigated.”

The complaints cited by NBC all came from one facility in Yuma, but federal court documents suggest retaliation against children may occur elsewhere, too.

Last month, attorneys visited several Border Patrol detention facilities in the Rio Grande Valley to interview dozens of detained children. They were investigating whether the federal government was complying with a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires that children be kept in “safe and sanitary conditions.”

The dozens of interviews, filed in federal court, also contain reports of retaliation and physical abuse. At least one girl said she was so afraid of retaliation by guards that she refused to allow attorneys to put her name on her declaration.

In another case, a 7-year-old girl said that children in her cell were found to have lice and so agents gave the other girls in the cell one lice comb each night as a preventive measure. But when the girls lost the comb, the guard punished them by taking away their mats and blankets, she said.

“We all slept on the hard tile floor last night,” she said.

Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University, told The Washington Post last month that when she alerted agents to that claim, they denied it. “I’m like, I’ve got a cell full of kids telling me that’s exactly what happened,” Binford told The Post.

One minor who had been detained in McAllen, Tex., for 21 days, without a shower or a phone call, claimed she witnessed CBP agents hit child migrants in the stomach but said the guards “try to intimidate us into not reporting these types of things,” according to the court filing. She claimed one officer warned that if they reported an assault that they couldn’t prove was true, they could go to jail for 25 years.

Another child, a 12-year-old, said the guards were “mean and scary.” One day, the boy said, a guard came in to the cell demanding to know who had “snuck food in the cell.” One hungry teenager cowered. He had smuggled in a burrito, pudding and juice. When the guards found his stash, they handcuffed him, the boy said. “My cousin and I were very shocked and scared,” he said.

Like the children in Yuma, others interviewed by lawyers who visited the Rio Grande Valley facilities said they were afraid to ask agents for food, to raise the temperature or to take a shower.

“The staff is so abusive I am afraid to ask for anything,” one teen mother detained in McAllen said in Spanish. “Yesterday, my baby was crying because he was hungry and the staff said to me, ‘Hey, take care of your baby. It’s okay to have them but you have to take care of them.’ They didn’t bring me any food for him.”

Another teen mom said that when a male guard at the Clint, Tex., facility saw her crying he asked, “Why did you come here if you don’t like it?” “When I think about what he said, I start to cry,” she said. “It is so difficult to be here.”

Only a few children said they weren’t scared. “No one scolds me or is mean here,” one 8-year-old detained at Clint said, adding that the “kids take care of each other.” “It is ok but I want to see my parents.”

The sworn declarations were filed as evidence last month as attorneys sought emergency relief from U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee and immediate remedies to fix the overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.

[Attorneys seek emergency court order to end ‘health and welfare crisis’ in migrant detention centers]

In a June 28 order, Gee ordered the federal government and attorneys for the children to work with an independent monitor to develop a plan to remedy the conditions at the detention facilities. In her three-page order, Gee appeared irked that the government did not already have a plan, given the Flores Settlement Agreement has been in place for two decades.

“If 22 years has not been sufficient time for Defendants to refine that plan in a manner consistent with their ‘concern for the vulnerability of minors’ and their obligation to maintain facilities that are consistently ‘safe and sanitary,’ it is imperative,” Gee wrote, that they make a plan right now.

The parties are expected to file a report on their progress by Friday.

Justice Dept. Watchdog Is Preparing to Deliver Verdict on the Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Adam Goldman', 'Charlie Savage', 'Matthew Rosenberg']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/ig-russia-investigation-steele.html,"Mr. Trump’s allies have sought to conflate the much broader Russia investigation with the dossier and have increased their attacks since the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded that while the campaign welcomed and expected to benefit from Russia’s election interference, the evidence did not prove any conspiracy.

Investigators working for Mr. Horowitz have asked witnesses about whether the F.B.I. properly opened the Russia investigation and how the bureau handled a pair of informants, including Mr. Steele, whose work was financed by Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Reuters first reported the investigators’ interview of Mr. Steele. They have conducted more than 100 interviews and have begun drafting their report, Mr. Horowitz wrote to lawmakers last month.

Mr. Horowitz is expected to answer whether Mr. Steele’s information played a role in opening the Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. Former law enforcement officials have insisted it did not, saying they opened the inquiry in July 2016. The Steele dossier did not reach the relevant agents until Sept. 19, 2016, nearly two months later, people familiar with the matter have said.

But the primary focus of the inspector general’s inquiry is the role that Mr. Steele’s information played in investigators’ effort to obtain court permission to wiretap Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved the application on Oct. 21, 2016, about a month after Mr. Page had left the campaign, and the wiretap order — one of 1,559 the court issued that year — was renewed three times in 2017, including twice by Trump-era Justice Department officials.

In August 2016, a month before agents on the Russia investigation received the Steele dossier, they had already started discussions with the Justice Department about seeking a wiretap order targeting Mr. Page, according to people familiar with the investigation’s timeline. Agents identified Mr. Page as a potential conduit between the campaign and Moscow, if there was any, because he had close business ties to Russia, had traveled there in July after joining the campaign, and had been targeted as a potential recruit by Russian intelligence agents in 2013 — yet did not seem concerned when the F.B.I. talked to him about it.

Still, the arrival of the dossier in September kicked the deliberations over whether to seek a wiretap order into a higher gear, according to people familiar with the Russia investigation. By adding further weight to their reasons to be suspicious of Mr. Page, Mr. Steele’s information helped officials overcome bureaucratic reluctance stemming from fears that any leak of the existence of such a wiretap would be politically radioactive."
Former State Department employee sentenced to more than three years in China spy case,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-state-department-employee-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-china-spy-case,"A federal judge sentenced former State Department employee Candace Claiborne to more than three years in prison and a $40,000 fine Tuesday for accepting thousands of dollars in cash and gifts from Chinese intelligence agents in exchange for information.

U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss said, “sentencing is never easy,” but also called Claiborne’s crime, “a truly grave offense, a betrayal of her employer and a betrayal of her country” before giving her 40 months in prison in a Washington D.C. courtroom.

Claiborne, 63, whom Moss agreed up until now had been a model citizen with no criminal history, said, “I’m sorry for what I did.” She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in April and faced up to five years in prison.

STATE DEPT. CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY PAID BY CHINESE AGENT TO SPY ON AMERICANS – YET NO CHARGES FILED

Claiborne, who held a top-secret security clearance, began working as an Office Management Specialist for the State Department in 1999. She served in multiple postings in Baghdad and Khartoum, Sudan, as well as Beijing and Shanghai.

“This is not what I had envisioned for my life... I still don’t know how I lost myself,” Claiborne told the judge. ""I lost my job, reputation and the trust of the government. I made a terrible mistake and now I'm paying the price.""

Federal prosecutor Thomas Gillice pressed for the maximum sentence, saying Claiborne knew what she was doing was wrong and kept doing it for her own financial gain for a long period of time.

“She did this repeatedly over a period of years and at the expense of her country,” said Gillice.

The government produced extensive evidence of contacts between Claiborne and two Chinese intelligence agents, including emails, text messages and at least one voicemail. Some of the documents she shared with the agents included U.S. economic strategies and visits by dignitaries between the two countries.

WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS

Prosecutors highlighted some of the conduct that occurred in 2011.

Over five years, the agents provided Claiborne with cash, meals, tuition payments for a Chinese fashion school, vacations, a furnished apartment, a laptop, a phone and a monthly stipend. Some of the gifts were given directly to Claiborne and others to her close family members.

In her journal, she noted that working for one of the agents could “Generate 20k in 1 year,"" the Justice Department said. In an email between Claiborne and a Chinese agent, the agent said: ""I will help your kids and also you make money in China.""

""Sounds like a plan!"" replied Claiborne.

Prosecutors also presented a ledger from Claiborne that specified a to-do list, which included ""Clean up Yahoo contacts.""

Moss noted that none of the information Claiborne gave to the Chinese was classified, but said it was still internal government information and that he wanted to send a message that this kind of conduct was “unacceptable.”

""If this has been classified information we would be talking about a sentence three or four times longer than this,"" Moss said.

In an effort to conceal her crimes, Claiborne instructed her co-conspirators to delete evidence of her connection to the agents.

As a term of her sentencing, Claiborne will also serve 36 months of supervised release and will sit down for an interview with the FBI as well as cooperate for a video with the State Department that may be used as a deterrent for current employees."
US rift with UK deepens as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cancels meeting over presence of British ambassador,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-cancels-meeting-with-uk-trade-minister-over-presence-of-british-ambassador,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross abruptly canceled a long-planned meeting with Britain's Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox Tuesday because the British Ambassador to the U.S. Kim Darroch was also due to attend.

A Trump administration source said that the meeting was jettisoned because of the row over leaked secret cables from Darroch that described President Trump as ""inept"" and ""incompetent."" The source said that it showed the rift between the Trump administration over the leaks was ""a real thing"" and growing.

The source said that Ross has been on personally ""warm and friendly"" terms with Darroch, who has been ambassador since January 2016, sitting down for dinner with him only a few days ago. The cancellation of the meeting calls into question the ability of Darroch, 65, to do his job and could hasten his recall to London.

A Commerce Department spokesman told the Washington Examiner: ""The department is working to reschedule today’s meeting to a mutually agreeable time.” The spokesman declined to comment further.

On Monday, Darroch's invitation to a White House dinner was rescinded. On Tuesday morning, hours before the planned meeting with Ross, Trump mocked Darroch via Twitter, describing him as a ""pompous guy"" and a ""very stupid fool.""

President Trump said Sunday Darroch had “not served the UK well” by writing in official cables to London, subsequently leaked to the public, that the White House was “uniquely dysfunctional” and “inept."" He added: ""We are not big fans of that man … I can say things about him, but I won’t bother.""

Fox, a longtime ally of Washington conservatives, has criticized the leaks but defended Darroch, saying he was ""held in high regard."" He told BBC Radio Monday: ""It’s not a problem with the ambassador. This a problem with the ethics of the individual who carried out this particular leak.""

Darroch, a former British national security adviser and ambassador to the European Union, was due to leave his post at the end of the year and to retire."

"Border apprehensions decline 28 percent following US-Mexico partnership, DHS says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Deputy Commissioner For U.S. Customs', 'Border Protection Robert Perez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-apprehensions-decline-dramatically-following-us-mexico-partnership,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that apprehensions at the southwest border plummeted in June after the Mexican government agreed early in the month -- under the threat of punishing U.S. tariffs -- to dramatically step up its own immigration enforcement efforts.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data showed a 28 percent drop in apprehensions from May, when 144,278 individuals were detained. Although some analysts blamed the ""summer heat"" for part of the new decline, the Trump administration noted in a statement that the decline in apprehensions ""outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent"" in the same period.

The numbers refer to would-be immigrants caught trying to illegally cross the border, and not migrants who approach ports of entry.

The reduction in apprehensions ""accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala,"" DHS said in a statement.

""Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care,"" the statement continued.

Law enforcement and administration officials said President Trump's hard push for the deal with Mexico had made all the difference. Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday that morale among law enforcement at the border had increased.

BORDER PATROL DECLARES 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY,' AS FORMER DHS OFFICIAL SAYS 'DESPERATION' HAS SET IN

""I think it's a combination of a few things,"" Perez said. ""I think it certainly is an unprecedented agreement that we've made with Mexico, that the president was able to secure about a month ago. We are definitely seeing and are encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken.""

Some Republicans, however, were not pleaded with Mexico's efforts. Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter that it was ""unacceptable"" to see the fourth straight month of more than 100,000 border arrests, even though he praised the decrease in monthly apprehensions as a ""good"" sign.

""The President was right to demand more from Mexico,"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Now some actions from Congress would be nice.""

Earlier in June, Mexico committed to deploy thousands of National Guard troops throughout Mexico, including at its northern and southern land borders, as well as to increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico just prior to that breakthrough, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% [sic] level ...!""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% [sic] Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump warned on May 30. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Shortly after Trump's threat but before the deal was reached, Mexico's financial intelligence agency announced it had frozen the bank accounts of 26 people who it claimed to ""have presumably participated in migrant smuggling and the organization of illegal migrant caravans.""

MEXICO USING X-RAY TECHNOLOGY TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

The agency said it had detected money transfers from central Mexico to six Mexican border cities presumably related to the caravans.

And some 200 Mexican military police, immigration agents and federal police blocked the advance of about 1,000 Central American migrants who were walking north along a highway in the southern part of the country.

""We are definitely seeing and are encouragd by the steps Mexico has taken."" — Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez

The group of migrants, including many women and children, set out early from Ciudad Hidalgo at the Mexico-Guatemala border and was headed for Tapachula, the principal city in the region. State and local police accompanied the caravan. The officials blocked the highway near the community of Metapa, about 11 miles from Tapachula.

And this week, it emerged that while the Mexican National Guard deploys to places like Tapachula on the country's southern border and makes changes to its asylum protocol, agents with the country's National Migration Institute (INM) are using a giant X-ray to find migrants being smuggled into the country in trucks.

Mexican officials said they caught more than 200 migrants hidden in trucks the last two days, using X-rays to see the people hidden inside.

The Mexican security ministry also said it found 228 migrants in a routine search of a soft drink transportation truck in one of its southern states on Monday.

"Kim Jong-un believes Trump is ""different,"" State Dept's intelligence arm assesses",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kim-jong-un-believes-trump-is-different-state-depts-intelligence-arm-assesses/,"It's likely that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continues to adhere to a deep-seated belief that the United States is seeking regime change in North Korea, but he is less convinced Washington will take military action and believes President Donald Trump is ""different,"" according to Ellen McCarthy, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR).

""I can't say whether or not [Kim] likes or dislikes [President Trump], we don't know that,"" McCarthy said. ""But we definitely [have] assessed that he does look at the president and thinks this one is different.""

As head of INR – the oldest all-source U.S. intelligence agency, and among the smallest, within the 17-member community – McCarthy leads a cadre of about 250 analysts at the State Department who provide assessments to the secretary of state, relevant policymakers and the president.

North Korea is an area where it's ""particularly hard"" to arrive at a fulsome intelligence assessment, McCarthy said. ""We're really relying on media analysis and other intelligence to get a sense of – in terms of Kim Jong-un – how he thinks of us.""

But she added, ""I would say that, based on our understanding of the media and things that he has said, he really does think that the U.S. is looking for regime change, and that he does not believe we'll take military action, and that – I think he thinks – we cheat on agreements, and that we're not necessarily to be trusted in that regard.""

In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, McCarthy, who assumed her current post in January after more than two decades spent in a variety of roles in the intelligence community and private sector, said the ""different relationship"" Kim and Trump have forged may have lessened Kim's suspicions about certain U.S. objectives.

""I think in general, when you look at all these world leaders, they all think that [regime change is] what we want, and frankly that has been a goal in many of our previous operations,"" McCarthy said. ""I don't know if that is as heavy on [Kim's] mind as it was in the past,"" she said.

Trump and Kim's most recent face-to-face meeting took place late last month in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, roughly 30 hours after president Trump first tweeted an offer to ""say Hello"" to Kim. Once they shared a handshake, and to Kim's apparent glee, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to, in about 20 paces, cross into North Korean territory.

While the three-hour visit generated worldwide headlines and wall-to-wall television coverage, it was unclear whether Trump's meeting yielded any more substantive progress in the nuclear talks, which have been stalled since the failed February summit in Hanoi.

And despite the consistently warm rhetoric exchanged by the two leaders, U.S. intelligence assessments about Kim's willingness to give up his nuclear weapons program remain unchanged. The 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment said the intelligence community ""continues to assess that [North Korea] is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities.""

""My sense is that that's still very much where our analysts lie,"" McCarthy said.

""But if all the intelligence is suggesting that this is what the intelligence says, we will give it to the policymaker,"" she continued. ""If they don't agree, they get to do that.""

""[A]n analyst is not losing a moment of sleep because of it, because it's our job to feed them the intelligence,"" McCarthy told Morell. ""It's their job to develop the policy.""

Trump administration will issue licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei,https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/us-will-issue-licenses-to-sell-to-huawei-says-commerce-secretary-ross.html,"A man walking past a Huawei P20 smartphone advertisement is reflected in a glass door in front of a Huawei logo, at a shopping mall in Shanghai, China December 6, 2018.

The U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell American-made goods to China's Huawei where there is no threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday, but left key questions unanswered about what products will pass muster.

Seeking to revive trade talks with China, U.S. President Donald Trump announced late last month that American companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.

Trump's comments came after the United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.

While American chipmakers welcomed Trump's announcement, many industry and government officials were confused about the new policy.

Speaking at an annual department conference in Washington, Ross affirmed that the company would remain on the Entity List, which meant licenses would likely be denied and that the new policy would not change the scope of items requiring licenses. However, he also said there would be some approvals.

""To implement the president's G20 summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,"" Ross said, referring to Trump's announcement at the meeting of world leaders in Japan.

""Within those confines, we will try to make sure that we don't just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms,"" he said.

After Huawei was added to the Entity List, the semiconductor industry lobbied the U.S. government for carve-outs to sell nonsensitive items that Huawei could easily buy abroad, arguing that a blanket ban would harm American companies.

On Tuesday, industry observers said Ross's comments lacked the clarity and relief many hoped for after Trump's announcement.

""The actual policy of what is not going to endanger U.S. security is not clear,"" Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said. ""The only way that industry can determine the line is by submitting (license) applications and knowing what types will be approved and which types will be denied.""

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."
Justice Dept. Seeks to Halt Democrats’ Suit Over Trump’s Profits in Office,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Monday asked a federal appeals court to issue an emergency order halting a lawsuit by congressional Democrats that alleges that President Trump has illegally profited from his family business while in office.

In a court filing, the department’s lawyers asserted that Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia had committed a series of “clear and indisputable” legal errors in allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The most glaring of them, the department said, was his decision that members of Congress had legal standing to sue the president.

Judge Sullivan, they argued in a filing to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrongly treated a complaint based on novel and flawed legal constitutional arguments as if it were “a run-of-the-mill commercial dispute.” If the appeals court refuses to intervene, they argued, the case will proceed into the evidence-gathering phase, in which Mr. Trump will be forced to reveal details of his financial affairs."

"Bill Clinton 'knows nothing' about financier Jeffrey Epstein's 'terrible crimes,' former president's spokesman says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Senators and State Department at Each Other’s Throats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Political Reporter']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-and-state-department-at-each-others-throats,"On Friday, June 28, an email with an odd subject line hit the inboxes of the Senate’s top national security staffers.

“RE: Gabriel—does this look good to you?” it read.

Beneath the cryptic subject line was an invitation from the State Department asking Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff to join a question-and-answer conference call with a top official working on Iran policy.

The call, on the following Monday, did not go well. Staff had been eager—and impatient—to hear how the administration would handle Iran’s decision to amp up its uranium enrichment. But after reading a bland statement full of already public information, Matt McInnis, a political appointee who works on Iran policy, said a technical difficulty meant he couldn’t take questions. The whole call lasted less than 10 minutes, according to multiple people on it.

“It was insulting,” said one staffer on the call. “It was such a box-checking exercise for them.” Another staffer described feelings of amusement mixed with horror.

For participants, the blunders were a microcosm of the metastasizing tensions between SFRC and the State Department. The committee is supposed to oversee the department. But five Hill staffers familiar with its work told The Daily Beast it has struggled under the leadership of Chairman Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump ally who wasn’t distinguished for broad foreign policy chops when he ascended to the post. Before Risch took the gavel, Sen. Bob Corker—who retired last year—ran the committee. While Corker was a traditional Republican who almost always voted with President Trump, he used the post to lambaste the administration’s frequently perplexing foreign policy choices. He even called the White House “an adult day care center.”

Under Risch, things are different. The conservative from Idaho has taken a much more deferential approach and is loath to publicly criticize the administration. He has yet to schedule open hearings on the war in Libya, the violent unrest in Sudan, and the free trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico.

Multiple staff blamed Risch’s non-combative approach for the committee’s struggles to get briefings and testimony from the department. And they point to debacles like the Iran conference call as evidence of the department’s disregard for the committee.

Risch’s defenders, meanwhile, say he engages in effective behind-the-scenes advocacy to the president and that until a few months ago, there were hardly any Senate-confirmed senior State Department officials who could testify. They also credit Risch with securing a long-awaited classified briefing from Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, though Democrats say they’re still frustrated Khalilzad hasn’t testified publicly.

The committee still has trouble getting answers. To this day, according to two staffers, the department has yet to provide the committee with a copy of the U.S./Mexico agreement on tariffs that Trump himself waved around in front of news cameras on June 11. Committee staff have sent weekly emails to the State Department—for months now—asking for details on the administration’s decision to cut aid to Central American countries and have yet to get substantive answers to their questions, per one aide.

“ It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration. ” — Senate aide

“It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration,” another aide said.

“We get very much a head-pat acknowledgement,” said a third staffer. “Kind of, ‘There, there, Congress, we’ll tell you the bare minimum and that’s that.”

Suzanne Wrasse, the communications director for Risch on the committee, said the chairman effectively advocates for SFRC.

“The chairman is a pragmatic lawmaker with a long history of working ‘behind the scenes’ to get results, not to make political points,” she said. “He is in regular contact with the president and his senior advisers, and has used his stature to deliver results for the committee on a bipartisan basis.”

Risch has also touted his warm relationship with Trump.

“He has treated me with nothing but respect and listened carefully to what I had to say, and sometimes I was able to move him,” the senator said in a February Roll Call interview. “Sometimes a little bit, sometimes more than a little bit. Sometimes not at all.”

One tense moment came when the administration decided to use an emergency declaration to green-light billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Traditionally, the State Department consults with SFRC on arms sales—but not this time. And it wasn’t for lack of talking; in the days leading up to the declaration, there was communication on the Iran situation between senior Trump administration officials and the Senate. Sec. Mike Pompeo and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a members-only briefing for senators just two days before the arms announcement. But the topic of an emergency declaration didn’t come up in that briefing, according to people familiar with it. Instead, SFRC staff found out about the arms deals the day the administration announced them, on May 24.

That day, State set up another conference call for congressional staff to explain their move. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary for political-military affairs, was on the call. At one point, a staffer pushed Cooper on why the department hadn’t worked with Congress on the move, given its oversight responsibility.

“That’s a matter of semantics,” Cooper replied, according to a source who was on the call—which then exploded. To some listeners, Cooper’s comment sounded like a glib write-off of Congress’s constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable.

Reached for comment on this incident, a State Department spokesperson pointed to congressional testimony Cooper gave several weeks later, where he said the department “value[s] deeply this Committee’s and Congress’ role more broadly in the review of the arms transfer process.”

The frustrations are percolating as Trump faces some of his thorniest foreign policy dilemmas yet. Just weeks ago, the president said he nearly green-lit a strike on Iranian targets that could have killed scores of people. Instead, the president deferred to the non-interventionists in his orbit—including Fox News host Tucker Carlson. But as crises materialize like it’s Whack-A-Mole, staff working with the committee responsible for overseeing American diplomacy say it’s in the dark. And they have to wonder: How could this administration handle negotiations with the Iranians if they can barely run a conference call about them?"
DOJ abruptly replaces lawyers defending Trump census citizenship question,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Nick Visser']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/08/doj-abruptly-replaces-lawyers-defending-trump-census-citizenship-question/23765795/,"The Justice Department abruptly announced Sunday it will replace the legal team that has represented the Trump administration in its efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom.”

The department gave no reason for the switch, but the move is another dramatic shift in President Donald Trump’s effort to add the question to the census. The Washington Post on Sunday noted that a person familiar with the case said some of the department’s career attorneys were uncomfortable with the president’s insistence on the issue. The New York Times reported that no DOJ attorneys in the federal programs branch, which traditionally represents the government in court, will be on the census case as it advances in the courts.

“The Attorney General appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters, and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress,” Kupec said.

Last week, government lawyers told a federal judge the White House would continue to move forward with its efforts to add the fraught citizenship question to the census, despite legal obstacles. Days earlier the Trump administration said it would drop the question after a Supreme Court decision temporarily barred the government from adding it.

The Census Bureau began printing forms for the tally after the decision, and had long noted that it needed a decision by June 30, the agency’s printing deadline.

But the administration reversed course a day later. Trump called reports he was abandoning the question “FAKE!” and said he was pressing ahead. Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge on Friday that they would continue argue the case, and Trump said he was mulling various strategies to get the question approved, including an executive order.

So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2019

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We could also add an addition on. So we could start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we’re working on a lot of things including an executive order.”

Civil rights groups have vowed to fight the White House once again should it attempt to add the question. The ACLU has argued it is meant to intimidate people of color and immigrant communities and would result in a massive undercount of up to 6.5 million people.

The census, mandated by the Constitution to count everyone living in the U.S., is used to allocate federal resources and also to allot seats in the House of Representatives.

KC police investigate death of veteran outside VA hospital,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article232443717.html,"Director of Kansas City VA Hospital has history of cover-ups from her previous job at Florida VA hospital Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later.

The Kansas City Police Department is investigating the death of a veteran who had a fatal brain hemorrhage after a confrontation with Veterans Affairs Police last year.

Department spokesman Jacob Becchina said the case of Dale Farhner has been assigned to Sgt. Richard Sharp, a longtime homicide detective.

“The results of our investigation will ultimately be compiled and forwarded on to the prosecutor’s office for their decision as to what if any applicable charges may apply,” Becchina said. “There is little info that can be released at this point, as it is now an open death investigation on our end.”

The VA has said the incident has already been investigated by federal law enforcement, and its officers have been cleared of wrongdoing.

But Becchina said that “a little less than a month ago” the Jackson County medical examiner forwarded the results of Farhner’s autopsy to Kansas City police to investigate.

The medical examiner has declined to release the results of Farhner’s autopsy, citing open investigations first by the VA and now by police.

Farhner, of Kingston, Missouri, was driving himself to the emergency room at the Kansas City VA Medical Center in May 2018 because of an infection from a hernia surgery he’d had there. A VA Police officer stopped him because he was going the wrong way in the parking lot. An argument ensued, and one or two officers took Farhner to the ground, according to a suit filed by his family.

He was semi-conscious when he got to the emergency room and was transferred to the University of Kansas Hospital, where he died two days later at age 66.

The Star began looking into Farhner’s death after receiving an anonymous tip about it shortly after.

An open records request revealed that the VA had nearly 20 pages of documents, plus audio and video recordings related to the incident in the parking lot. But the agency has rebuffed repeated requests for the information, saying the matter was still under investigation and that making it public “would likely negatively impact a frank discussion on matters of policy between subordinates and supervisors.”

The VA has also refused to provide information about Farhner’s death to members of Congress and Farhner’s family, who filed their wrongful death suit in May 2019 after they got no response to an administrative complaint.

The leader of a Kansas City Vietnam veterans group has said the agency’s silence smacks of a cover-up, and Kansas City VA Medical Center director Kathleen Fogarty has been accused of cover-ups at her previous job leading the Tampa, Florida, VA hospital.

Kansas City VA hospital spokesman Vernon Stewart denied last month there was any attempt to obscure what happened, saying that federal law enforcement had “fully investigated this matter and determined that VA acted appropriately in its interaction with the veteran.”

“VA will cooperate fully with any additional official investigations,” Stewart said.

That now means cooperating with Sharp, the KC Metropolitan Crime Commission’s 2018 Officer of the Year. Sharp’s duties include coordinating Metro Squad investigations of murders in small towns near Kansas City.

“He has some paperwork from the VA and he is waiting on some more, and he’s also going to check with our federal partners to gather any investigative material they may have compiled on this prior,” Becchina said. “This may be a process that takes some time, as any death associated with police contact would, in order to get everything right.”

A report published in December by the VA’s Office of Inspector General found that the agency’s 4,000-plus police officers operate without effective management or oversight, leading to a system lacking accountability.

In an article published Monday, the news website The Intercept said it had reviewed the VA Police’s performance over the last 10 years and “identified dozens of credible allegations that VA cops in every corner of the United States have neglected standard police procedures, violated patients’ constitutional rights, or broken the law.” It briefly mentioned the Farhner case.

Anyone with information on the case is asked to contact the Kansas City Police Department homicide unit at 816-234-5043. To remain anonymous, call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477."
USDA Report Could Set Tone for Higher Corn Market Highs,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/successful-marketing/usda-report-could-set-tone-for-higher-corn-market-highs-successful,"Traders want to know what acreage number the USDA will print in tomorrow's July Crop Production Report.

The expectations for the monthly July Supply and Demand report are not as clear as they normally are this year. For instance, we could see changes in this report that we normally would not see in a July report. The main one: any adjustment to acres from the late June Planted Acreage report.

Typically, the USDA takes the acres from the late-June report and uses the exact numbers for the monthly July report. The last time it made any major adjustment to this process was in 1993. It is no secret that 1993 and 2019 have many similarities. This is why it would not surprise me to see some adjustments to acres in the report tomorrow (Thursday).

Keep a close eye on the cash corn market. Cash basis levels are reaching or have already hit record-tight levels in many areas. This is a great sign for the bulls. The life of a bull market is often longer when it is being led by a strong cash market.

Is it too early to talk about frost? One reason that cash corn is so strong could be that end users are concerned about finding enough new-crop corn this fall. With the extended window of pollination this year, the threat of an early frost is much more serious.

U.S. State Department approves possible $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/u-s-state-department-approves-possible-2-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1U32HT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Taiwan of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an estimated value of $2.2 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday, despite Chinese criticism of the deal.

China’s foreign ministry expressed anger about the sale and urged the United States to revoke it. The timing is especially sensitive as the Washington and Beijing are seeking to resolve a bitter trade war.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, would not alter the basic military balance in the region.

DSCA notified Congress on Monday of the possible arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative tanks, heavy equipment transporters and related support.

Reuters reported last month that an informal notification of the proposed sale had been sent to the U.S. Congress.

The United States has no formal ties with self-ruled and democratic Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a serious violation of international law and a “crude interference in China’s internal affairs, harming China’s sovereignty and security interests.”

“China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this and has already made stern representations to the US side,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

“Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory and nobody should underestimate the Chinese government’s and people’s firm determination to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose foreign interference.”

China urged the United States to immediately revoke the planned arms sale and end all contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added.

Taiwan’s Presidential Office expressed “sincere gratitude” to the U.S. government for the arms sale.

“Taiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,” Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan’s president, said in a statement.

Related Coverage China calls on U.S. to withdraw arms sale to Taiwan

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.

The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taipei’s military raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said last month in a statement."

Obama judge denies DOJ request to change lawyers in census citizenship question case

A New York federal judge barred the Justice Department on Tuesday from changing its lawyers in a legal fight over the Trump administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman, an Obama appointee, said government lawyers' motion for the change was ""patently deficient"" except in the case of two lawyers who have already left the department or the civil division which is handling the case. President Trump lashed out at the ruling on Twitter, writing, ""So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?"" So what's next? The president has indicated in the past week that he would use his executive order power to add the question to the census.

Trump stands by Labor secretary but says he will look into his handling of the Epstein case

President Trump on Tuesday defended Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who is facing mounting calls to resign over his handling of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s 2008 sex trafficking case. Acosta, who was U.S. attorney for Florida at the time, helped Epstein to secure a plea deal that resulted in an 18-month sentence—he served just 13 months. The deal was criticized as lenient because Epstein could have faced a life sentence. Acosta negotiated a deal that resulted in two state solicitation charges, but no federal charges. Trump said a lot of people were involved in Epstein's case a decade ago and that it needed to be reviewed very carefully. But he added that Acosta has been an ""excellent"" secretary of labor who's done a ""fantastic job.""

Howard Kurtz, host of ""Media Buzz"" on Fox News, has one warning about the Epstein case, as lurid as the allegations are: Be careful about implicating Trump, former President Clinton and others, despite the hedge fund manager's many political connections.

AOC-Pelosi war of words rages on in fight for soul of Democratic Party

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., fired back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., saying she found remarks by the leader of their party's caucus ""puzzling"" after Pelosi dismissed her and three other progressives, Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., who'd voted against a $4.6 billion border aid package at the end of June. “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi told the New York Times last Saturday. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people, and that’s how many votes they got.” On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez responded, ""It’s not even the four of us. It’s like ‘These ones.' What the speaker said... it’s not true. It’s just wrong... as progressives, it’s okay not to vote for the legislation to make a point."" Fox News' Sean Hannity says ""all-out war"" is erupting in the Democratic Party and Pelosi is losing control of her caucus to AOC and ""the new extreme left.""

NYC to give World Cup champion US women's soccer team heroes' welcome

Thousands of fans and tons of confetti are expected as New York City and the nation honor the U.S. women's national soccer team for its World Cup title victory with a ticker tape parade up Gotham's Canyon of Heroes. The parade will begin at 9:30 a.m. ET and move up the Canyon of Heroes, a section of Broadway between the Battery and City Hall. The stretch of lower Manhattan has long hosted ticker tape parades for world leaders, veterans and hometown sports stars. The festivities come amid speculation over whether the team will be invited to the White House and whether its stars would accept the invitation. Team superstar Megan Rapinoe doubled down in her opposition to visit the Trump White House on Tuesday but expressed that she was open to accept invitations from anyone who ""believes the same things we believe in"" like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, and Rep.

Remembering Ross Perot, populist pioneer

Ross Perot, billionaire businessman and 1992 independent presidential candidate who won 19 percent of the vote, died Tuesday at age 89. One presidential historian argues Perot may have been President Trump's predecessor in terms of offering a populist, anti-establishment message to voters and was not the spoiler in the 1992 election that figures in the George H.W. Bush re-election campaign made him out to be. ""There's always been a populist strain in American politics,"" Craig Shirley told ""The Ingraham Angle,"" calling Perot ""prescient"" regarding comments he made about NAFTA. In those remarks in the early 1990s, Perot famously claimed the trade agreement would result in a ""giant sucking sound"" as jobs left the U.S.

""There is no impeachment team,"" Jay Sekulow, who has represented the president from the early days of his administration, told ABC News' ""The Investigation"" podcast. ""I just don't see this as a real threat.""

Sekulow said calls for impeachment by Democrats were simply ""political theater.""

Although pro-impeachment Democrats face an uphill battle from party leadership, they are likely to get another chance to ratchet up support in the public arena when special counsel Robert Mueller appears for open hearings before two House committees next week.

Sekulow told ABC News that his team is not concerned about Mueller's testimony.

""I do not expect that he will deviate at all from [his report], nor do I expect that he will go into anything extemporaneous or extraneous from this,"" Sekulow said. ""I think he's going to stick to the report. In that sense, I think it's going to be the great letdown.""

In May, during his only public comments following his investigation, Mueller said his report was his final testimony and that he would not share information beyond what was written in the report during his public testimony.

Peter Halmagyi/Handout via Reuters

But even though impeachment is not Sekulow's main focus, his team is working to defend the president from several inquiries currently playing out in court.

Most recently, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit against the Department of Treasury to gain access to Trump's tax returns. The committee subpoenaed these records from the department in May, but the Treasury Department has resisted turning over the records, arguing that the committee lacks a ""legitimate legislative purpose"" for requesting them.

""We will be intervening in that lawsuit on behalf of the president,"" Sekulow said, adding that he anticipates the case making it to the Supreme Court.

The president's tax returns are also still under audit, according to Sekulow.

""I won't disclose the context of the nature of the audit because that would be disclosing attorney-client privilege,"" Sekulow said. ""But what I am going to tell you is that there is an ongoing audit.""

The president has said the main reason he has not released his tax returns is because of this ongoing audit. The IRS has previously declined to comment on the matter.

Outside of the Mueller probe and battle for the president's tax returns, Sekulow said his role has expanded to managing other cases involving the president an his family, including cases from the Washington D.C. District Court, the Southern District of New York and the New York State Attorney General's Office. The president, his foundation, his personal business and his family remain under legal scrutiny in these districts. Attorneys for the president have argued that many of these cases, including the New York attorney general's investigation into Trump's foundation, are ""politically biased.""

Trump's legal team has been in frequent flux since the start of his presidency, but Sekulow has remained a constant figure.

He attributes his staying power to his years spent playing drums.

""I think part of the success here is having the right tempo,"" Sekulow said. ""So I think I stayed in the groove, so to speak."""
DHS officials set for grilling over facial recognition tech,https://thehill.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/452282-dhs-officials-set-for-grilling-over-facial-recognition-tech,"Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are set to testify before a House panel on Wednesday about the government’s use of facial recognition as Congress presses toward legislation curtailing the use of the controversial technology.

The hearing comes as lawmakers reel over the release of documents showing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses state driver’s license databases for facial recognition searches without consent from individuals.

Though an ICE representative will not be present at the hearing, a House Homeland Security Committee spokesperson told The Hill the tranche of documents – which revealed the government is scanning millions of Americans’ faces without their permission – is likely to come up.

Representatives with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), agencies within DHS, will face tough questions about how the department is using the technology increasingly across the U.S.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonHillicon Valley: Appeals court rules Trump can't block people on Twitter | Tech giants to testify in House antitrust investigation | DHS set for grilling over facial recognition tech | Commerce to allow sales to Huawei DHS officials set for grilling over facial recognition tech Cuccinelli: Critics of detention conditions 'complaining about the numbers they're attracting' MORE (D-Miss.) in a statement said he believes it is “imperative” that such sensitive technologies “only be used for authorized purposes in a fully transparent manner.”

“Federal agencies – like DHS – must balance their critical security mission with a commitment to safeguard citizens’ civil liberties,” Thompson said. “Before the government deploys these technologies further, they must be fully scrutinized and the American public needs to be given a chance to weigh in.”

Documents released by a top privacy group over the weekend have set off alarm bells for privacy hawks in Congress and outside, providing insight into how ICE and the FBI use state driver’s license databases when searching for suspects in investigations.

According to records obtained by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology and shared with The Hill, ICE has requested facial recognition searches of driver’s license databases in Utah, Vermont, and Washington hundreds of times in total. The queries offer one of the first glimpses into ICE’s use of the controversial biometric tool, which scans people’s faces for the purposes of identifying them.

Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Georgetown privacy center, said it’s likely that ICE is running similar searches in other states.

“If ICE is running face recognition searches in these states, ICE may well be searching driver’s license databases across many of the other ten states (and the District of Columbia) that allow undocumented residents to drive,” Rudolph wrote in a blog post, calling the secretive partnership a “serious betrayal of residents’ trust.”

ICE defended its use of face scanning, saying it tracks with its general approach to prosecution.

“During the course of an investigation, ICE has the ability to collaborate with external local, federal and international agencies to obtain information that may assist in case completion and prosecution efforts,” ICE said in a statement defending the practice. “This is an established procedure that is consistent with other law-enforcement agencies.”

It has also been known for some time that the FBI is one of the top federal agencies using facial recognition capabilities, conducting over 4,000 searches on average per month. The FBI has amassed a database of over 640 million photographs, including 36 million mugshot photos, 21 state driver’s license directories and multiple other sources of information.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said this year they are working to come up with legislative solutions to the rapid rise of facial recognition tech across the country, which they say raises privacy and civil rights concerns. The House Oversight Committee has been at the forefront of the push, holding a series of hearings in which lawmakers on opposite sides of the political spectrum have come together to voice opposition.

Jordan said his office is currently working with top Democrats “to come up with the right kind of legislation.”

On Wednesday, the House Homeland Security Committee will jump into the debate as members press the witnesses over one of the most controversial government uses of the technology -- its implementation in airports.

Officials with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), agencies within DHS, will testify about their efforts to implement an expansive face scanning program in airports, a plan that has drawn significant ire from Capitol Hill.

Rogers plans to spotlight the improvements CBP has made to its facial recognition program and ask questions about best practices for the technology.

DHS has said it hopes to use facial recognition technology on 97 percent of departing air passengers by 2023, and its face scanning program – dubbed “Biometric Exit” – has been implemented at over a dozen U.S. airports so far.

CBP and TSA are likely to defend the merits of facial recognition technology, which can be used to identify people in the U.S. illegally and speed up the process of getting through the airport. But amid a larger uproar over whether the federal government is overstepping in the technology’s uses, they’re likely to get significant pushback.

“What I hope gets discussed is both the degree to which agencies, especially CBP, have simply really gone ahead using what is in many ways a novel and very dangerous technology without congressional authorization, without getting anyone’s approval,” Jake Laperruque, senior counsel with the Project on Government Insight, told The Hill in a phone interview.

The various federal agencies use facial recognition technology for different purposes – the FBI and ICE say they only tap their face scanning capabilities during criminal investigations, while CBP and TSA are leading the effort to implement the technology in airports and at the border.

But any legislative solution is likely to rein in all of those uses as public sentiment grows increasingly wary of the technology.

Top digital rights group Fight for the Future on Tuesday launched a campaign to impose a total federal ban on the government’s use of facial recognition technology, as other privacy groups press for a temporary pause or stricter regulation.

“Our position is that this technology is simply too dangerous to be used for government surveillance,” Fight for the Future said in a statement. “It falls into a category with nuclear and biological weapons, where the potential harms to human society far outweigh any potential benefits. That's why we're calling for an outright ban.” The group asking its supporters to raise their concerns with Congress.

Jordan during the Tuesday interview said he’s not sure if lawmakers are planning to call for an all-out ban or a pause on the technology.

“Whether it's an all-out ban or not, I don't know,” Jordan said. “Whether it's a time-out, I don't know. But the good news is we're working together, and this is one of those few areas where we've been able to find some common ground.”

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
The UK ambassador who called Trump 'inept' was reportedly disinvited from a Treasury Department dinner. The White House will have plenty more opportunities to shun him.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Alexandra Ma'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-ambassador-kim-darroch-disinvited-mnuchin-dinner-report-2019-7,"The British ambassador who called Trump ""inept,"" ""insecure,"" and ""incompetent"" in a series of leaked diplomatic cables was reportedly disinvited from a Monday dinner.

It appears to be a swift enactment of Trump's intention to freeze out Sir Kim Darroch, the first of many opportunities to show official displeasure.

Sir Kim Darroch was notably absent from a dinner that US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hosted for President Donald Trump and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, Bloomberg and CBS reporter Mark Knoller reported.

Both cited unnamed US officials who said his invitation had been rescinded. Darroch's invitation after Trump tweeted on Monday that "" we will no longer deal"" with the British ambassador, Bloomberg and Knoller said.

Trump's tweet did not make clear whether the administration would cut off all communication with Darroch. The White House has yet to respond to Business Insider's request for clarification.

Business Insider has contacted the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office for confirmation and comment.

Monday's dinner, which was held in the Treasury Department's historic Treasury Cash Room, was attended by US officials including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Transport Secretary Elaine Chao, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner facing charges of soliciting prostitution and paying for sex in Florida, was on Trump's table, photos of the event show.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF director nominated to lead the European Central Bank, was also pictured at the table.

""This is a who's who of people in business,"" Trump said of the attendees, according to White House pool reporters.

Freezing Darroch out of Washington?

Darroch's leaked memos have already irked the Trump administration, and his apparent disinvitation from Monday's dinner could be the start of the White House's campaign to shun him in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday further piled on Darroch, calling him in a series of tweets a ""a wacky Ambassador,"" ""not someone we are thrilled with,"" ""a very stupid guy,"" and ""a pompous fool.""

Prior to the leak the British ambassador had hosted many high-profile events, which were attended by White House officials including Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway, former Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Mnuchin, Politico reported.

Their past attendance seem to contradict Trump's claim on Monday that Darroch ""is not liked or well thought of within the US.""

However, now that the displeasure of the president has been noted publicly, Trump's inner circle may help make this a reality.

'There are no winners here'

Despite Trump's protestations, British Prime Minister Theresa May defended Darroch, saying that she has ""full faith"" in him even though she disagrees with his view of the president.

Leslie Vinjamuri, head of Chatham House's US and Americas program, told Business Insider: ""Britain will keep Sir Kim in Washington, and he will be marginalized on a daily basis.""

""There are no winners here. Not in America and not in London. The US and UK need each other,"" she added.

""Trump is now going to be doing a workaround. The question is whether he looks to others in the British government for an ally, or whether he simply looks beyond Britain.""

The New York Times cited unnamed British officials in the US as saying that the leak may have been engineered to ensure that Sir Mark Sedwill, the current head of the UK civil service and a longtime diplomat, was not appointed.

According to this theory, the leak may have been trying to encourage the UK to appoint a more pro-Trump, pro-Brexit diplomat to succeed Darroch, the Times reported.

This is not the first time the Trump administration has snubbed its allies in Washington.

Last year it quietly downgraded the EU's diplomatic status, for an unexplained reason, from being the equivalent of a full nation state to a lesser rank.

This manifested itself when the EU ambassador, David O'Sullivan, was called on last from a line of more than 150 diplomats to pay respects at former President George H.W. Bush's funeral last December.

The administration also left O'Sullivan out of diplomatic events for weeks. The higher rank was later restored."
Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452066-environmental-groups-fight-epas-new-public-records-restrictions,"A coalition of environmental groups pushed back Monday against a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that could restrict access to public records.

The new EPA rule, the details of which were first reported by The Hill, allows the administrator and other political appointees to review all materials requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”

The groups that signed the letter, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and many others, have asked Wheeler to withdraw the rule, saying it would be improper to implement it without giving the public a chance to weigh in on its impacts.

EPA’s new rule is similar to the controversial process employed by the Department of the Interior, which also lets political appointees review FOIA requests before they are released to the requester.

Critics of the rule at EPA and Interior have highlighted the potential for abuse.

“Aside from this requirement intuitively granting political staff heightened opportunities to interfere with FOIA requests, it is difficult to see how this change could possibly improve the Agency’s FOIA efficiency or enhance the public’s lawful access to information,” the groups wrote in their Monday letter.

There is already talk in Congress of using legislation to limit the review of public records documents by non-FOIA staff, something the agencies refer to as an “awareness review.”

“Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access,” Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyOvernight Health Care — Sponsored by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids — Appeals court appears skeptical of upholding ObamaCare mandate | Drug pricing deal faces GOP pushback | Trump officials look for plan B after court strikes drug TV ad rule Trump officials seek plan B on drug pricing rule GOP senators raise concerns over potential deal to lower drug prices MORE (R-Iowa) said in a late June speech on the Senate floor.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”

Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyKatherine Clark quietly eyes leadership ascent Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule UN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty MORE (D-Mass.) is also considering legislation in response to the new rules.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” an EPA spokesman said last month.

In Monday’s letter, the groups contend that holding back documents from a FOIA request is illegal.

“The law is clear that FOIA does not permit agencies to withhold a record or a portion of a record “on the basis of responsiveness,” they wrote.

EPA and Interior have said the FOIA rules are a necessary update to congressional changes to the FOIA law in 2016.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights when the rule was first unveiled in late June. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” the EPA said in a statement when it first announced the rule change."
New Human Rights Panel Raises Fears of a Narrowing U.S. Advocacy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Eileen Sullivan']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/state-human-rights.html,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that he was installing a human rights advisory panel in the State Department, and named a conservative law professor as its chairwoman, to review and tighten the agency’s definition of human rights and ensure it is grounded in the “nation’s founding principles” and a 1948 United Nations declaration.

The State Department already houses an internal bureau that oversees human rights issues. But the new panel, which Mr. Pompeo said would examine “the role of human rights in American foreign policy,” will not be managed by the bureau and was created without substantial input from its experts and officials.

“International institutions designed and built to protect human rights have drifted from their original mission,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect.”

The announcement, along with a blunt commentary by Mr. Pompeo that was published in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, raised worries among human rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Pompeo is moving to curtail State Department advocacy for some rights, particularly ones related to women’s health and reproduction and gay and transgender issues."
Department of Justice is reportedly planning to replace in-person interpreters with informative videos at immigration hearings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Lauren Frias'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-officials-replace-human-interpreters-with-videos-at-immigration-hearings-2019-7,"The Department of Justice is planning to replace human interpreters at immigration court hearings with informative videos briefing migrants facing deportation on their rights, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The DOJ introduced the switch to immigration judges across the US last month, calling it a ""cost-saving measure"" for a bogged-down immigration court system, according to The Chronicle. The plan could be implemented as early as mid-July.

The video was proposed as a solution to the issue of ""master calendar"" hearings, where immigration judges meet with dozens of undocumented immigrants in ""rapid succession"" to inform them of their rights and obligations and schedule cases, the number of which is close to reaching one million, according to The Chronicle.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department told INSIDER that there is no specific policy change for using informative videos for ""master calendar"" hearings, which typically only last 10 to 15 minutes. Rather, the shift away from in-person interpreters is ""part of an effort to be good stewards"" of the limited resources of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The video, which would be recorded in multiple languages, would serve a similar purpose: informing immigrants on their rights and the course of the court proceedings. Telephone services will also be used for on-demand translation to migrants, when available.

Some judges and immigration advocates, however, are concerned about the videos.

""It's a disaster in the making,"" one judge told the Chronicle, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have approval to talk publicly. ""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate? You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?""

Los Angeles judge Ashley Tabaddor, who is also union president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told the Chronicle that she believed budget concerns don't justify the shift away from human personnel.

""Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost; it's an integral part of every case,"" Tabaddor said to the Chronicle. ""If they actually look at the [immigration] courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters.""

Jeffrey Chase, a former immigration judge, said to The Chronicle that he believes the lack of human interpreters could discourage trust in the court system. Chase, who now volunteers for organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants, is also concerned about due process for immigrants.

""There's no longer concern about the balance,"" he said. ""It's totally efficiency-heavy these days, and I think it's being decided by people who haven't been in the court much and don't understand the consequences."""
"Homeland Security requests 1,000 additional troops at border",https://nypost.com,['July'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/08/homeland-security-requests-1000-additional-troops-at-border/,"The Trump administration wants to send 1,000 more troops to the US-Mexico border “to provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support” to Border Patrol agents, officials said Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security made the request last week and is waiting to get approval from the Pentagon, according to an agency spokesperson.

DHS officials are looking to send troops from the Texas National Guard.

“Governor Abbott has consented to the use of the National Guard to support CBP,” said the DoD spokesperson in a statement.

“Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,” the statement added. “These holding facilities house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. These holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.”

The additional 1,000 National Guard members would be a major boost to President Trump’s policing of the US southern border. There were already 6,000 troops in the region as of April — 2,100 of whom were members of the Guard, The Hill reports.

Trump has gotten criticized recently over the conditions at federal detention centers along the border, with Democratic lawmakers calling them terrible and “disgusting.”

The president has denied the accusations.

Vice President Mike Pence is planning to travel to the border town of McAllen, Texas, with a bipartisan delegation later this week."
VA loan churning is driving up mortgage costs for all government borrowers,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Jessica Guerin Is An Editor At Housingwire Covering Reverse Mortgages', 'The Housing Wealth Space. She Is A Graduate Of Boston University', 'Has A Master S Degree Northwestern S Medill School Of Journalism. She Worked Previously As The Editor-In-Chief Of The Reverse Review Magazine', 'Which Was Recently Acquired Housingwire.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49518-va-loan-churning-is-driving-up-mortgage-costs-for-all-government-borrowers,"The churning of loans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs has long been a thorn in Ginnie Mae’s side, as the agency has worked for three years to curb abuses by VA lenders, even going so far as booting some lenders from its securities platform and restricting others for questionable conduct.

And, it seems even the authorities are getting involved, with the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York subpoenaing at least eight lenders earlier this year as part of its investigation into loan churning that amounts to higher mortgage fees for military veterans.

Now, the Urban Institute has tacked a number to the problem.

The institute recently released a study asserting that fast prepayments as a result of churning is driving up rates on all government mortgages by seven basis points, or 0.07%.

That means that on an annual basis, the payment for a $250,000, 30-year mortgage with a 4.25% interest rate is $175 more because of the costs of churning on VA loans.

While the institute acknowledges that this is “not a huge number,” it says it is nonetheless significant, especially because it stands to increase if larger investors lose faith in Ginnie Mae because of rampant churning.

“Churning can cause a VA borrower to pay an above-market rate for a period of time and additional origination fees on the new mortgage,” the study states. “In many cases, the new mortgage is a cash-out refinance, so the increased balance includes both the fees and some equity taken out for the borrower.”

All Ginnie Mae borrowers pay the price for high VA prepayment speeds in the form of higher interest rates, the study states.

While Ginnie Mae has expressed its concern over VA loan churning and has taken steps to curb abuses, the Urban Institute says more must be done.

One potential route would be strengthening the net benefit test for refinancing to require lenders to better explain to borrowers the impact of a refi. Or, the agency could consider further restricting refis on recent originations. Among the most drastic changes would be the creation of a separate Ginnie Mae security for the VA program.

But of course, with all actions there are reactions, and Ginnie Mae must weigh the total impact of such moves before it acts.

“Any of these options could impose significant costs on the mortgage system and create winners and losers,” the study states. “Nonetheless, doing nothing is not a good option.”"
U.S. refiners urge EPA to keep biofuel waiver requests secret from USDA,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuel-refineries/u-s-refiners-urge-epa-to-keep-biofuel-waiver-requests-secret-from-usda-idUSKCN1U4244,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A law firm representing small U.S. refineries has urged the Environmental Protection Agency to keep refiners’ applications for waivers from the nation’s biofuel policy secret from the Department of Agriculture, arguing that the petitions include confidential business information.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo

The request, made by Perkins Coie in a letter to the EPA dated July 8, adds to mounting pressure from representatives of the refining industry for the Trump administration to box the USDA out of the controversial waiver program.

The letter follows Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue publicly expressing opposition to the way the program has been run in recent years.

The program can exempt small refiners in financial turmoil from their responsibility to blend ethanol into gasoline under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Waivers can save them tens of millions of dollars but are broadly opposed by the corn industry, which argues they undercut biofuel demand.

Since President Donald Trump took office, the EPA has roughly tripled the number of waivers it has granted to small refiners, drawing anger from the corn lobby and putting Trump in the middle of a battle between two powerful constituencies important to his re-election campaign.

In the letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Perkins Coie said the applications contained confidential business information (CBI) that should not be shared with the USDA.

“The USDA seeks the small refineries’ CBI in order to assert influence over EPA’s final decisions and thereby reduce the number of small refinery petitions granted by EPA. This interference is improper as a matter of law,” it said.

The letter added that refiners feared the USDA would share the confidential information in the applications with players in the agriculture community, which could undermine the refineries’ ability to compete.

“We would view any release of CBI to USDA as an indication that USDA was given improper influence over the decision-making process for small refinery hardship relief,” the letter said.

Last week, Republican senators representing oil states wrote to Trump asking him to keep Perdue away from any decision-making process over the petitions. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also wrote to Perdue saying he will block confirmation of agency nominations until Perdue “stops interfering.”

Perdue has often sided publicly with farmers on the issue of biofuel waivers and told farmers at an event in Iowa recently that he had spoken to Trump about it and was helping to devise a fix. Trump has also ordered a review of the small refinery waiver program after hearing criticism from farmers during a recent tour of farm country."

Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reluctant-witnesses-in-fisa-abuse-probe-agree-to-talk-to-doj-inspector-general,"Key witnesses sought for questioning by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."
Trump 'dossier' author grilled by U.S. Justice Dept. watchdogs - sources,https://af.reuters.com,"['Mark Hosenball', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1U40ZY,"(Reuters) - Federal lawyers probing the origins of the investigation of ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign have interviewed the author of a “dossier” that alleged misconduct between Trump and Moscow, prompting the lawyers to extend their inquiry.

Three attorneys from the Inspector General’s office of the U.S. Department of Justice met in person in early June with dossier author Christopher Steele in Britain, said two sources with direct knowledge of the lawyers’ travels.

The interview with Steele, a former top spy on Russia for Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, took place while Trump was in London for a formal state visit with Queen Elizabeth and a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May.

Steele’s dossier, made public in 2017, alleged that Moscow attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that there was potential collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign, along with other unverified and salacious claims about the president.

The Justice Department’s inspector general has been examining the earliest stages of an FBI investigation of Trump, his former 2016 presidential campaign rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Russia and former Trump adviser Carter Page.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office is an internal Justice Department watchdog, launched his probe in March 2018 amid allegations by Republican lawmakers that the FBI erred in seeking a warrant to monitor Page.

Trump has described the Steele dossier as “bogus” and Republicans have long sought to discredit the FBI’s investigation, which was later taken over by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His final report on Russia and the Trump campaign was released in redacted form in mid-April.

In that same month, Attorney General William Barr, who now heads the Justice Department, told a congressional committee that the Horowitz probe would be completed by May or June.

One of the two sources said Horowitz’s investigators appear to have found Steele’s information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation. Its completion date is now unclear.

A key focus of the Horowitz probe is whether the FBI followed proper procedures when it applied for a warrant with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to secretly conduct surveillance on Page and his ties to Russia.

Declassified documents show that the FBI cited information in Steele’s dossier when it asked the secretive FISA court in late 2016 for a warrant to eavesdrop electronically on Page, a U.S. businessman with interests in Russia.

Horowitz’s office in Washington declined to comment.

A spokesman for Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele’s London investigations firm, declined to comment.

UK government agencies declined to disclose whether they were in contact with Horowitz’s team in London.

Moscow repeatedly rejected accusations of interfering in the election.

Mueller’s report, released on April 18, said that Russia did meddle in the election in an attempt to boost Trump’s candidacy. It said Trump campaign officials had multiple contacts with Russian officials. But it found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow.

The report also described numerous attempts by Trump to impede Mueller’s inquiry, but it stopped short of declaring that he committed a crime. Mueller during his inquiry brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and ex-Trump aides.

Page, a foreign policy adviser during Trump’s campaign, drew scrutiny from the FBI, which said in legal filings in 2016 that it believed he had been “collaborating and conspiring” with the Kremlin. But he was not charged.

Investigators working for Mueller in September 2017 twice interviewed Steele, who also gave written testimony to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee in August 2018. That panel and other committees of Congress have taken up where Mueller left off after his investigation ended."

The approval was received after a more than 15-month rigorous assessment of the flight, payload, and data management assurance performance of DJI Matrice 600 Pro and Mavic Pro drones equipped with DJI Government Edition firmware and software. “The Department of Interior’s report validates DJI’s effort to build software and hardware solutions that meet the evolving data security needs of its customers,” said Mario Rebello, vice president and regional manager of North America at DJI. “The DOI has a strong track record of leadership within the US government for its ability to pragmatically evaluate and implement drone technology for use across a wide variety of applications. We appreciate their partnership and value the collaborative effort to help create a DJI drone solution that will allow emergency first responders and others to save lives and effectively manage our public lands. We look forward to continuing to support the Department of Interior and other federal agencies with DJI’s industry-leading drone technology.” The DOI’s findings were presented in a flight test and technical evaluation report issued last week*. Key findings of the report included: 1. DOI has been working with DJI for over two years to create a solution that would allow its bureaus access to DJI’s high-quality off-the-shelf hardware equipped with custom firmware and software to prevent intentional or unintentional data leakage to any outside entities. 2. Testing of the DJI Government Edition solution began in April 2018 as part of the three-phase testing plan developed by DOI. 3. Testing included 1,133 flights totaling 298 hours on the DJI Matrice 600 Pro and 1,112 flights totaling 240 hours for the DJI Mavic Pro drones. 4. DOI collaborated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center as well as other industry and federal partners with expertise in data management assurance testing to conduct targeted assessments of DJI Government Edition hardware, firmware, and software. 5. During testing there was no indication that data was being transmitted outside the system, confirming that they were operating as promised by DJI. While DJI customers have full control over how the data they generate with drones is collected, stored and transmitted, DJI Government Edition’s unique architecture ensures that drone data – including photos and videos captured during flight – can never be intentionally or accidentally shared with unauthorized parties. The solution is based on DJI’s industry-leading drone hardware and is controlled by custom device firmware and operational software in a unique architecture that supports high data security requirements: • No Data Transmission — A permanently enabled Local Data Mode within the custom DJI Pilot application prevents users from accidentally or even intentionally transferring data from the mobile application over the internet to third parties or to DJI. • Firmware Reviews — Government agency aviation and IT departments can review firmware updates in electronic isolation before applying them to their fleets, and have full control over how to validate them and when to install them on DJI drones. • Restricted Hardware Pairing — Drones and remote controllers running DJI Government Edition solution firmware can only be linked with each other and are not compatible with other off-the-shelf DJI products, preventing the use of unsecure hardware and unauthorized third-party applications. The DJI Government Edition solution as validated by the DOI, referred to as DJI Government Edition v1.0**, for DJI Matrice 600 Pro and DJI Mavic Pro drones is available for purchase through select authorized DJI Enterprise resellers in the United States.

State Department awards new $2B supply chain security contract,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/state-department-gdit-supply-chain-rebid/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

General Dynamics Information Technology will continue managing the State Department’s global supply chain’s security, under a $2 billion rebid it announced Tuesday.

Another company, AECOM, had protested the initial award in September but was denied, allowing Falls Church, Virginia-based GDIT to move forward on the five-year, single-award contract with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security Countermeasures Directorate.

The new contract enhances its 2012 predecessor with the provision of a “fully integrated, turnkey solution” that includes technical security systems, hybrid supply chain and distribution management, and a global logistics and transportation network.

“This award demonstrates GDIT’s commitment to providing world-class solutions for our customers and expanding the broader security mission of federal agencies,” said Amy Gilliland, president of GDIT, in the announcement. “We are excited to continue supporting one of the federal government’s largest supply chain and logistics operations.”

GDIT, a business unit of General Dynamics, will continue delivering security solutions to embassies and other high-threat State Department posts worldwide."
DHS continues surging personnel to border despite big decline in illegal crossings,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-continues-surging-personnel-to-border-despite-big-decline-in-illegal-crossings,"The Department of Homeland Security has continued to surge hundreds of supplemental personnel to the border even as the number of people who illegally crossed and presented at ports of entry in June declined dramatically.

Manuel Padilla, chief of the department’s Interagency Border Emergency Cell, told the Washington Examiner in a recent interview 500 DHS personnel were sent to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; El Paso, Texas; and Yuma, Arizona, to assist Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the height of the deployments this spring.

The number of nonborder personnel deployed south fluctuates day to day but remained around the same levels in late April.

“There’s still over 500 DHS personnel being deployed,” a senior DHS official told the Washington Examiner Monday afternoon. The official said “there’s no discussion” to stymie those efforts, even after the number of people arriving at the border dropped by more than 37,000 in June to 94,500, from 132,000 in May.

Padilla said the southern border is still in “crisis” and additional personnel are necessary to transport people in custody to medical facilities, prepare food, and other standard tasks. Those borrowed personnel free up agents and officers to return to normal responsibilities.

He added the border crisis — as the Trump administration has described the state of affairs — will not cease until the number of people in custody at DHS facilities matches the number each facility is supposed to hold. In early June, CBP reported 20,000 in custody despite room in facilities for 4,000.

CBP, which includes Border Patrol and port officers, is the first agency that encounters migrants on the border. Individuals are then either released from custody into the U.S. or turned over to ICE for deportation or held there before also being released into the U.S.

The downturn comes weeks after Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to step up the country’s enforcement efforts to curtail people traveling through Mexico to the United States.

Padilla has returned from Washington to San Antonio, Texas, where he is managing the deployments as part of a longer-term operation, as well as carrying out his regular duties as director of the department’s Joint Task Force-West."
Trump shuts out British ambassador for high-level dinner,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Dave Boyer']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/8/kim-darroch-disinvited-treasury-department-dinner-/,"The British ambassador to the U.S. was disinvited to a high-level dinner at the Treasury Department Monday night in honor of the emir of Qatar, as President Trump moved to freeze out the diplomat who wrote unflattering cables about his administration.

The move to pull the invitation for Ambassador Kim Darroch came after Mr. Trump tweeted that his government “will no longer deal with” the diplomat.

Mr. Darroch missed out on a glittering dinner in the ornate “Cash Room” at Treasury, adjacent to the White House, featuring a guest list of Fortune 500 CEOs and international financiers.

At the dinner, Mr. Trump called the Amir a great friend of the U.S. and thanked him for building a U.S. military base there.

“Better your money than ours,” the president joked.

“This is a who’s who of people in business,” Mr. Trump said of the attendees.

Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin hosted the dinner for Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, on the night before the emir meets on Tuesday with Mr. Trump at the White House.

The president said Tuesday’s meeting will be big, “from defense to purchases and trade, and I know everything’s going to be very positive.”

Qatar has been embroiled in a public feud with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, who have accused Doha of backing Islamist militants and Iran.

Among the guests at the dinner were Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg; Trump confidante Thomas Barrack, chairman and CEO of Colony Northstar; Ron Burkle, co-founder of The Yucaipa Companies; Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and a Trump friend; Eli Miller, managing director of Blackstone Group; Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO of Bank of America Corp.; Michael Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Company; David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group; Edward Breen, chair and CEO of DowDuPont; John DeGioia, president of Georgetown University; Raytheon Chairman Tom Kennedy; Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken; Steven Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm Inc.; Lorenzo Simonelli, CEO of General Electric; Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times; Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T; Chevron chairman and CEO Michael Wirth; Christine Lagarde, managing director and chairman of the International Monetary Fund; and World Bank President David Malpass.

Several Cabinet members also attended, as well as presidential advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

Department of Labor reports trucking employment on the rise,https://www.ccjdigital.com,['Commercial Carrier Journal'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.ccjdigital.com/new-figures-from-labor-department-show-trucking-employment-upswing-in-recent-months/,"CCJ‘s Indicators rounds up the latest reports on trucking business indicators on rates, freight, equipment, the economy and more.

New data released by the Department of Labor on Friday presents a rosier picture of trucking employment through the first half of 2019 than originally indicated by earlier, preliminary data. Instead of a lackluster 400 jobs added since January — compared to the nearly 50,000 between December 2017 and December 2018 — the DOL’s upwardly revised numbers indicate the for-hire trucking industry added 7,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in 2019’s second quarter and 11,700 jobs since the beginning of the year.

According to the DOL’s monthly Employment Situation Report, the second-quarter upswing was capped by a 4,300-job uptick in June. The U.S. economy as a whole added 224,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate climbed a tenth of a percent to 3.7 percent.

Employment in the for-hire trucking industry totaled 1.519 million in June — a gain of 36,800 jobs from the same month last year.

The transportation and warehousing sector as a whole in June added 23,900 jobs, according to the DOL, while major freight producing sectors like manufacturing and construction added 17,000 jobs and 21,000 jobs, respectively."
