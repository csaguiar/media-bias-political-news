"Angry Dem says Trump ‘raping the country,’ as impeachment push nears critical mass",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/angry-dem-says-trump-raping-the-country-as-impeachment-push-nears-critical-mass,"A rapid-fire string of developments has congressional Democrats putting increased pressure on party brass to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, with one rank-and-file lawmaker reportedly saying the president is “raping the country” and others indicating it's only a matter of time before leadership changes course on the politically fraught issue.

Amid the internal tensions, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a special meeting of House Democrats for Wednesday morning, where the impeachment issue and other battles are expected to be discussed.

Prior meetings involving Pelosi and top Democrats held Monday evening escalated into heated exchanges, with the party torn over how to address Trump controversies -- most recently, the decision to block the former White House counsel from testifying. Democratic leaders, who for the most part have not been publicly in favor of impeachment, are now finding it difficult to maintain their position as calls grow from the ranks to flip that switch.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN NADLER: TRUMP IS MAKING IT 'MORE DIFFICULT' NOT TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT

A senior House Democrat told Fox News late Monday that Pelosi “isn’t going to be able to hold off on impeachment much longer,” and that the speaker may have to change her position “within the next two weeks.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while saying Pelosi is working to bring the party together, suggested Tuesday that politics are the main element preventing members from pressing ahead at this stage.

“Just as impeaching without cause could be construed, and is, politically motivated, choosing to not impeach when there is an abundance of cause could also be construed similarly,” she told reporters.

Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., reportedly confronted Pelosi during a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee meeting as he demanded the president's impeachment. According to Politico, Cohen said that while former President Bill Clinton was impeached “over sex,” Trump was “raping the country.”

Cohen reportedly suggested Pelosi is worried about politics in her reluctance to proceed, but Pelosi countered, “This isn’t about politics at all. It’s about patriotism.”

Cohen is among the most outspoken Trump critics in Congress. He drew attention by eating fried chicken during a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing as a commentary on Attorney General Bill Barr’s refusal to testify. Cohen referred to the attorney general as “Chicken Barr,” despite Barr having testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee the previous day. Cohen has also called for the House to use its inherent contempt power to throw Barr in the Capitol jail.

But as House Democrats weigh contempt proceedings for Barr, another fight broke out Monday after former White House Counsel Don McGahn was instructed by the president's team to defy a subpoena from the same committee. Democrats wanted him to testify regarding information he provided to the Special Counsel's Office, but the White House directed him not to appear, with the Justice Department asserting he has immunity from testimony about his official duties.

""The Democrats do not like the conclusion of the Mueller investigation – no collusion, no conspiracy, and no obstruction – and want a wasteful and unnecessary do-over,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said after a closed-door meeting with Pelosi that Trump is “making it very difficult to avoid” considering impeachment.

Pelosi insisted that her party remains united, saying Tuesday that she's not feeling pressure from colleagues.

“There’s no divide,” she said a day earlier. “We’re fine. We’re good.”

Nadler, meanwhile, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that he intends to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress for not complying with the subpoena. Nadler said the White House’s effort to keep McGahn from testifying was part of a pattern of “lawless behavior,” and Trump is “willing to go to any lengths to prevent testimony that might implicate him.”

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., head of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Monday that McGahn’s failure to testify on Tuesday would be grounds for opening an impeachment inquiry.

In addition to fighting off Democratic efforts to have McGahn testify, the president is currently in the midst of legal battles over Democratic subpoenas for his personal records. He sued Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to block a subpoena for his banking records, and was also trying to keep documents from accounting firm Mazars USA away from Congress.

A judge ruled against Trump in the Mazars case on Monday, stating that the House Oversight Committee was entitled to view the documents. The main argument from the Trump administration has been that Democrats lack a legitimate legislative purpose for their inquiries, but Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the possibility of finding conflicts of interest in the administration or violations of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause sufficed.

FEDERAL JUDGE SIDES WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER SUBPOENA FOR TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

Pelosi touted Mehta’s ruling as a win, as well as a reason why impeachment is not necessary at this point.

“Today, we won our first case,” Pelosi reportedly said at the Steering and Policy Committee meeting. “We’ve been in this thing for almost five months and now we’re getting some results.”

Rex Tillerson Secretly Meets With House Foreign Affairs Committee to Talk Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-secretly-meets-with-house-foreign-affairs-committee-to-talk-trump,"Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson spoke with the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs committee on Tuesday in a lengthy session that, an aide said, touched on his time working in the Trump administration, the frictions he had with the president’s son-in-law, and efforts to tackle issues like Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Tillerson’s appearance, first reported by The Daily Beast, took place as virtually every other Trumpworld luminary has been stonewalling congressional oversight efforts. At the same time the former secretary of state was speaking before lawmakers, former White House counsel Don McGahn was ignoring a subpoena to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

Tillerson’s arrival at the Capitol was handled with extreme secrecy. No media advisories or press releases were sent out announcing his appearance. And he took a little-noticed route into the building in order to avoid being seen by members of the media.

Tillerson reached out to the committee and expressed a willingness to meet, a committee aide said. In a more than six-hour meeting, he told members and staffers that the Trump administration actively avoided confronting Russia about allegations of interference in the election in an effort to develop a solid relationship with the Kremlin, a committee aide told The Daily Beast.

Tillerson also told members and aides that he had tried to establish a formal and disciplined interagency process at the State Department whereby the president could receive informed briefings on sensitive foreign policy matters, the aide said. That effort never manifested, Tillerson told the committee, in part because of the president’s management style, but also because of interference from other aides.

Tillerson told the committee that the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at times impeded his ability to communicate effectively and introduce to President Trump policy proposals developed by State Department experts on major foreign affairs matters across the globe, not just in the Middle East. Kushner, a White House adviser, has publicly focused much of his international efforts on the Middle East and is set to unveil a Middle East peace plan in the coming weeks.

Tillerson had a notoriously prickly relationship with the president, reportedly calling him a “moron” in private. But he was present during critical moments of the administration, including Trump’s private 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany.

Since leaving his post, Tillerson has rarely made public appearances, save for speaking at a panel in Houston in December. During that appearance, he said there was “no question” Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

“So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’ and I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law,’” Tillerson said.

Tillerson’s interview by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) comes a month after special counsel Robert Mueller published his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, top Democrats on the Hill have demanded that Attorney General Bill Barr and Mueller answer questions related to the report and its publication. Barr has declined to testify before the House, citing the insistence of the committee that staff lawyers be allowed to conduct some of the questioning. Mueller is reportedly in negotiations to testify, though the Department of Justice had previously not agreed on a date for him to do so.

On Tuesday, CNN reported that Mueller’s team had expressed reluctance about the possibility of a testimony taking place in public for fear that it would appear political.

Opinion | China Deserves Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas L. Friedman'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html,"China kept insisting it was still “a poor developing country” that needed extra protection long after it had become the world’s largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world’s biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world’s next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.

And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a “Made in China 2025” modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China’s private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.

This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America’s best companies.

As a result, all China’s subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we’d be crazy. Trump is right about that.

Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time — and they have been. I’m not sure Trump understands that.

But I’m not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?

And how much money did China save — to subsidize its own companies — when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?"
"Pelosi’s Strategy Is Working, and Trump Is One Step Closer to Being F*cked",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Rick Wilson'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pelosis-strategy-is-working-and-trump-is-one-step-closer-to-being-fcked,"I’ve been a deep skeptic of impeachment as a political strategy, putting me solidly in the Nancy Pelosi go-slow camp. I’ve argued time and again that the smart play is IIABN: Impeachment in All but Name, but the great beast of Washington shambles ever forward, its ponderous, inexorable tread leading it toward the inevitable impeachment proceedings against Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States.

Can you make an impeachment case for obstruction based purely on the released information in the Mueller Report? Absolutely.

First on CNN: Another top Trump aide to exit as legislative activity dries up,https://www.cnn.com,"['Sarah Westwood', 'Pamela Brown']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/shahira-knight-white-house-exit/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's point person on Capitol Hill, Shahira Knight, is leaving her post as multiple aides in the White House legislative affairs office and beyond eye the exits heading into a campaign season that will likely freeze legislative activity on both sides of the aisle.

Multiple sources close to Knight say she has discussed leaving the White House for months, and her impending exit was widely expected -- particularly because she told colleagues she wanted to last a year in the job, and her anniversary in the role is approaching in mid-July.

""Shahira has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director. She was outstanding for us and for our country and will be a tremendous success in the private sector,"" Trump said in a statement to CNN.

Knight informed the President of her decision to leave on Tuesday afternoon.

""It has been a great honor to serve President Trump and this country,"" she said in a statement. ""I will always be grateful for the experience I have gained, and proud of the accomplishments I have helped achieve alongside a very talented White House team.""

A White House official says she was given a job offer in the private sector that she felt she couldn't turn down.

Knight has warned legislative staff that now is the time to leave, a source familiar with her comments said, if they want to land the lucrative consulting jobs many ex-aides have hoped would be their reward for working in the White House. The reason: consulting firms and corporations may soon start to hold off on writing lavish paychecks to Trump-connected operatives until they see if the President will be reelected or if they will need to seek personnel connected to a new administration.

The uncertainty surrounding who will occupy the Oval Office less than two years from now could temporarily limit job prospects for departing White House officials, forcing those currently on the inside to decide on their next move sooner rather than later -- or risk being stuck in their jobs through January 2021.

Johnny DeStefano, a top White House aide , became the latest senior official to submit his resignation this week after working in the West Wing since the start of Trump's presidency. A source close to DeStefano said he is in talks to take on an advisory role at Juul, an e-cigarette company, although he is not expected to lobby for them.

And the legislative affairs team could slim down even more significantly due to the dim prospects for passing any substantial legislation in a presidential election year, when all members of the House and many in the Senate will be focused on running for their own seats as well as campaigning for their party's nominees.

An administration official says its typical for legislative affairs shops to slim down after two years when it gets closer to the election. At least one legislative affairs aide has already left to take a job at a consulting firm in the past month, and more are expected to follow him out the door in the months ahead.

Leon Panetta, who spent three years as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and who is also close to former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, told CNN that dramatic turnover in a White House legislative affairs shop is ""not normal.""

""The problem today is that Washington is more dysfunctional than ever, and there is a growing inability of the President and the leadership and the Congress to be able to work together to get things done, and that frustration may clearly be having an impact on the people who work in the legislative area,"" Panetta said.

He noted past presidents have typically pursued aggressive legislative agendas during the first two years of their first terms and then struggled more on Capitol Hill during the second two years, but have still retained their legislative affairs offices because things like spending bills still need attention, even in an election year.

Sources say Knight has also seen her clout diminished by the arrival of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, whose Capitol Hill ties as a former congressman have allowed him to engage directly with members and effectively sideline Knight in many discussions.

A similar dynamic has played out with the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, according to one of the sources. A source familiar with the dynamics said Knight is frequently left out of senior-level meetings in which legislative issues are discussed. At times, the source said, legislative aides have received phone calls from lawmakers about upcoming meetings at the White House that Knight and her team did not even know had been scheduled.

""Shahira is an incredible asset to me, to this administration, and to the country,"" Mulvaney said in a statement. ""She's as valuable for her strategic political insights behind the scenes as she is for her numerous public contributions. I've enjoyed working alongside her every day I have been here, and it is an understatement to say that she will be sorely missed.""

Two White House officials refuted the suggestion that Mulvaney has bypassed Knight routinely, noting the acting chief of staff frequently loops Knight in on his talks or briefs her afterward on conversations he has had with members. The official said Mulvaney values Knight's opinion.

""Their relationship is solid,"" one of the officials said.

A source close to Kushner said he also does not intentionally circumvent Knight when he interacts with lawmakers and that he always aims to fill her in after the fact if he's had substantial conversations on the Hill. But the nature of his increasingly hands-on role with policy means he is conducting his own congressional outreach, the source acknowledged, and that has sometimes left Knight on the sidelines.

""It was truly a pleasure to work with Shahira on so many important issues including the historic tax reform package and criminal justice reform,"" Kushner said in a statement to CNN. ""Her ability to navigate the politics on Capitol Hill will be greatly missed here at the White House."""
Trump Expected to Pick Ken Cuccinelli for Immigration Policy Role,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/trump-ken-cuccinelli-immigration.html,"He is the second person to be given a prominent role in the Trump administration this month after publicly backing aggressive immigration policies on cable news, which Mr. Trump consumes with gusto. Mr. Trump named Mark Morgan, who was forced out as Border Patrol chief two days after Mr. Trump took office, to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Mr. Cuccinelli served as attorney general in Virginia from 2010 to 2014, running unsuccessfully for governor there in 2013. A prominent conservative, he supported Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president in 2016, leading an effort to win over delegates to the party’s convention, including those supporting Mr. Trump. That kind of history has kept other officials from jobs they had hoped to get in the Trump administration.

Cecilia Muñoz, the director of the domestic policy council in the Obama administration, said the appointment of Mr. Cuccinelli was concerning given his support in the past for denying citizenship to American-born children of undocumented immigrants and for a proposal to allow employers to fire workers who do not speak English on the job.

“It’s hard to put into words,” Ms. Muñoz said. “The president is trying to send an ever tougher message, but ultimately these things are symbols just in the same way the wall is a symbol. Even if you are desperate to show how tough you are, you’re not likely to produce a policy that addresses the problems at the border or the interior.”

Mr. Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, were both under consideration for the immigration role. But Mr. Cuccinelli was always seen within the White House as the favorite, and Mr. Kobach did not help his case with Mr. Trump and some of his advisers with a list of the 10 “requirements” he had for taking the job, including access to a government jet 24 hours a day, weekends off with his family in Kansas and a promise to be nominated for Mr. McAleenan’s job by November if he wanted it."

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
DOJ renews counteroffer to Schiff over unredacted Mueller report,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Darren Samuelsohn', 'Kyle Cheney']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/21/justice-department-mueller-schiff-letter-1337537,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff got another counteroffer from the Justice Department in response to a request for the full Mueller report. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress DOJ renews counteroffer to Schiff over unredacted Mueller report

The Justice Department on Tuesday reiterated its counteroffer to the House Intelligence Committee to view an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in a last-ditch effort to avert an “enforcement action” against the attorney general.

In a letter to the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff on Tuesday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd again offered members of the committee to review a “minimally redacted” version of Mueller’s report — tripling the number of lawmakers allowed to view the report from 12 to 34.

Story Continued Below

So far, the six Democrats currently allowed to access the report have refused to view it in protest of the restrictions.

The less-redacted document does not include grand jury material or the requested foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information Mueller’s team gathered as it investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

Boyd’s latest letter follows a protracted back-and-forth between the House panel and DOJ over the full Mueller report. Schiff and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, asked the Justice Department for the full, unredacted report and its underlying evidence in March. Schiff subpoenaed the Justice Department earlier this month with a deadline of May 15, claiming the department had failed to respond to the panel’s requests.

Schiff on Tuesday said he’s “not ready to comment yet” on DOJ counteroffer.

In his letter, Boyd warned Schiff that “in recognition of the committee’s interest in counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence matters,” DOJ is “willing to expedite access” to the prioritized information the panel wants — provided the committee “confirms today that it will not pursue any vote on an ‘enforcement action’” now or in the future.

Boyd also warned that the DOJ would “not continue” the process of identifying, locating, and reviewing the documents requested by Schiff if the House Intelligence Committee moves to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt on Wednesday.

The latest offer from DOJ does not appear substantially different from the original offer, which Schiff called “unacceptable” and said “places the department at risk of unlawfully withholding foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information from the committee.”

After the May 15 deadline came and went with no new documents provided to the committee, Schiff told reporters that he would be consulting with the House general counsel on some kind of “enforcement action” that the panel may vote on as soon as Wednesday.

Boyd seemed eager to avoid that, telling Schiff that should the panel avoid a contempt vote on Wednesday, DOJ will “host a meeting with the committee’s senior staff” on May 23 and 24 to update them on the status of its own review of the requested documents. Boyd called it “an extraordinary accommodation” on DOJ’s part.

Schiff has expressed frustration over what he’s described as an unexplained delay in receiving a briefing from the FBI on the counterintelligence portion of the special counsel probe. He’s also claimed that the intelligence community “is obligated to share” grand-jury information with the House Intelligence committee, citing an exception that allows DOJ “to provide information of a counterintelligence or foreign intelligence nature” to the panel.

DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

Biden would beat Trump in Pennsylvania despite president's 2016 win: Donna Brazile,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-would-beat-trump-in-pennsylvania-despite-presidents-2016-triumph-in-the-state-over-hillary-clinton-donna-brazile,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to win back a key battleground state for the Democratic Party that President Trump took in 2016, according to ex-DNC Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.

Brazile, speaking during an interview on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday, said Biden would be able to make up the less than one percentage point Trump won by in Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“Look, I think it’s going to be a close election across the country. But, Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania by less than 50,000 votes,"" she said.

""Joe Biden will be able to make that up. But, not just Joe Biden—any one of the Democrats I think can be very competitive in the Keystone State.”

TRUMP, AT RAUCOUS PENNSYLVANIA RALLY, SLAMS SCRANTON-BORN BIDEN: 'HE DESERTED YOU'

Brazile’s comments follow a fiery rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Monday night where the president hit hard at Biden.

As he was ending his speech, Trump told a packed crowd, “Don’t forget: Biden deserted you. He’s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please.”

Biden served as a Senator from Delaware for over 30 years but was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

""This guy talks about 'I know Scranton,'"" Trump said. ""Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you.""

JOE BIDEN TELLS YOUNG ACTIVISTS HE STARTED PUSH TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN 1987

Brazile countered, “He’s well known in Pennsylvania and he’s not the forgotten son. He is the forgotten hero.”

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week shows Biden beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania 53 to 42. Additionally, according to a report from Politico using what it said was the Trump campaign’s internal polling, Biden is also ahead in two more highly contested states: Wisconsin and Michigan.

However, both Biden and the president will face a packed field in 2020 with 22 other Democratic candidates now in the running and a long road still ahead.

“The one thing you can give Joe Biden credit [for] is he understands the electorate and he wants to win,” said Brazile. “But, again, he has to get through the Democratic primary...Joe Biden has got to not only maintain his lead, but he has to expand his appeal to voters who might not be familiar with his record as well as voters who might want to see a different face in the White House in 2020.”

“And we have to explain that’s not our job, we don’t do nice stories or bad stories, we just do truth and accurate if we can,” he continued, adding that covering Trump is “so personal.”

Baker said that despite Trump's repeated attacks calling the press the “enemy of the people,” the president often tries to ""charm"" members of the media to get them “on his side.”

“There is this thing when he sits down with an individual or a reporter to try to charm them, to try to get them on his side,” he told Hill.TV.

Trump has long held a contentious relationship with the mainstream media, repeatedly lashing out at various news outlets. The New York Times is a frequent focus of his ire—he refers to the paper as the ""failing"" New York Times.

In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump renewed attacks against the Times over a report concerning some of his financial transactions.

According to the Times report, Deutsche Bank employees flagged several possible suspicious transactions by entities controlled by Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerOn The Money: Judge upholds House subpoena for Trump financial records | Trump vows to appeal ruling by 'Obama-appointed judge' | Canada, Mexico lift retaliatory tariffs on US | IRS audit rate falls The Hill's 12:30 Report: Amash under fire after impeachment tweets Ann Coulter: Four myths the media and politicians tell you about our border crisis MORE.

Trump slammed the report and refuted its findings.

“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money,” he tweeted.

The Times’ financial editor later disputed Trump’s claim that he could have done business with any bank, saying Deutsche Bank was the only one willing to lend to him.

""I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US,"" he tweeted.

The Trump Administration Is Burying Evidence Its Coal Plan Will Kill Thousands,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Bess Levin', 'Vanity Fair']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/trump-epa-coal-plan-deaths,"Last August, the soot fetishists in the Trump administration released a proposal to prop up dying coal plants by giving states free rein to come up with their own rules, or let them petition to opt out of profit-killing regulations altogether. Among the many problems with Donald Trump’s “Affordable Clean Energy rule”? Technical analysis from his own Environmental Protection Agency showed that whereas Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan was expected to prevent between 1,500 and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030, Trump’s replacement would cause as many as 1,400 premature deaths (just in America) each year. To many people, that seemed like a lot! So the administration has come up with a new tactic to get the nation on board. No, it’s not to keep Obama’s plan in place or to actually make sources of human-killing dirty energy comply with any sort of legitimate oversight. Instead, it’s to ignore science to get those pesky predicted deaths out of future disclosures.

The New York Times reports that the E.P.A. plans to “get thousands of deaths off the books,” not by doing anything to actually prevent those deaths, but by altering “the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution,” which would “make it easier to roll back a key climate-change rule.” (According to reporter Lisa Friedman, “The E.P.A. . . . is normally expected to demonstrate that society will see more benefits than costs” from a rule change, and apparently some people don’t get that killing off four figures’ worth of Americans per annum is a worthy trade-off for increased corporate profits.) Naturally, experts say the new modeling method is “not scientifically sound,” a situation that obviously poses no concern for this White House:

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. . . . in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter—the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream—is linked to heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency’s analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation . . . which is expected to be made public in June.

Jonathan M. Samet, the dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, said that the most recent studies show negative health effects far below the 12-microgram safety threshold set by the E.P.A. “It’s not a hard stop where we can say ‘below that, air is safe.’ That would not be supported by the scientific evidence,” Samet told the Times. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, added, “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” calling the expected change a “monumental departure” with “significant impact” that would likely lay the groundwork for gutting more environmental regulations in the future. William L. Wehrum—who, it will surely surprise you to hear, worked as a lobbyist and lawyer for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before joining the E.P.A.—would just as soon take his industry cronies’ word for it:

. . . fossil-fuel advocates ask, why should the E.P.A. search for health dangers, and, ultimately, impose costs on industry, in situations where air is officially considered safe? Wehrum, who worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before moving to the E.P.A., echoed that position in two interviews. He noted that, in some regulations, the benefits of reduced particulate matter have been estimated to total in the range of $40 billion.

“How in the world can you get $30 or $40 billion of benefit to public health when most of that is attributable to reductions in areas that already meet a health-based standard,” he said. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

Actual scientists say it makes total sense, noting that standards for particulate matter are a lot like speed limits; while 65 miles per hour is typically “considered reasonable” to prevent deaths, it doesn’t mean that an accident couldn’t happen at lower speeds. There are reasons not to force people to drive at 20 or 25 miles per hour on the highway, and most people accept the risk of driving at 65. In this case, however, the administration is in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the risk here—1,400 people dying every year—is worth it, purely to allow the fossil-fuel industry to make some extra cash. Even someone as dumb as Trump knows that’s a hard sell.

Cheating on your taxes?

If you’re among the ultra-rich, you’re probably in the clear!

The Internal Revenue Service audited just 0.59 percent of individual tax returns last year, marking the seventh consecutive annual decline as the tax agency copes with smaller budgets and fewer workers. . . . Audits of the highest-income households dropped sharply, to their lowest levels since the I.R.S. began reporting that data in 2008. In fiscal 2018, the I.R.S. audited 6.66 percent of returns of filers with more than $10 million in adjusted gross income, down from 14.52 percent in 2017. Among households with income between $1 million and $5 million, the audit rate dropped from 3.52 percent to 2.21 percent.

Last year, an investigation by ProPublica revealed that a person making $20,000 a year and claiming the earned-income tax credit was much more likely to be audited than someone making 20 times that amount. So if you’re dodging taxes and are a cartoon villain who hates the poor, this is doubly good news.

How’s Trump’s trade war going?

Well, on Monday, more than 170 retailers, including Adidas and Nike, signed a letter begging him not to impose a threatened 25 percent tariff on footwear that could cost consumers an estimated $7 billion a year. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley predicted that no trade deal plus further tariffs, which Trump is considering, could cause a global recession. Meanwhile, China has indicated that it has no intention of backing down anytime soon:

China’s government looks to be settling in for a long trade war with the United States, with President Xi Jinping invoking one of the Communist Party’s most epic—and ultimately successful—battles. The Chinese leader, accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China.

Meanwhile, China’s main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to push back the Americans. . . . The planned coverage of the Asian Film Awards was ditched Friday for the classic war movie Heroic Sons and Daughters, the story of Chinese “volunteer troops” who helped North Korea fight the Americans in the 1950s. Then, over the weekend, came three more movies about resisting the United States: Battle on Shangganling Mountain and Surprise Attack. Another classic, the 1960 film Guards on the Railway Line, about Chinese scouts rooting out spies who work for the Americans, was due to screen Monday night.

Oh, and a song about the trade war—an extremely niche genre—has reportedly gone viral and includes the lyrics: “If the perpetrator wants to fight, we will beat him out of his wits.” So you might say Trump’s trade war isn’t going great!

The White House would really prefer that a witness to Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice not speak with House Democrats

It’s almost as though the administration has something to hide:

Trump on Monday directed former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to defy a congressional subpoena and skip a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, “denying House Democrats testimony one of the most important eyewitnesses to Trump’s attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation.”

Since last month’s release of the 448-page redacted report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Democrats have sought for Mr. McGahn to publicly give his account of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart investigators. . . . Democrats hoped that hearing directly from Mr. McGahn in a televised hearing would help galvanize public opposition to Mr. Trump.

Mueller cited McGahn more than any other witness in his report on whether the president obstructed justice. In interviews with the special counsel’s investigators, McGahn detailed several episodes including an effort to oust Mueller—that showed the president intent on using his position atop the executive branch to protect himself from the Russia inquiry.

During his own testimony, Attorney General William Barr claimed it was “not a crime” for the president to instruct McGahn to lie to investigators about Trump’s attempt to fire Mueller, a legal opinion many have taken issue with.

William Barr’s revealing quote about his agenda,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'May At Pm']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/21/william-barrs-revealing-quote-about-his-agenda/,"

Attorney General William P. Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee this month. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)

Attorney General William P. Barr is on something of a media tour. In his first interviews since taking control of the Justice Department, he has expounded upon and defended some of his controversial decisions.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Sadie Gurman, he said something revealing too:

... Mr. Barr, who as a private citizen bristled at the barrage of legal and other challenges Mr. Trump faced during his first two years in office, said his long-held belief in executive power is more about protecting the presidency than the current officeholder. “I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,” Mr. Barr said. That sentiment plus coaxing from friends led the 68-year-old grandfather of five to sign on for another turn at the helm of the Justice Department, where his quest to protect presidential power has taken on new significance in light of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report and the Trump administration’s effort to thwart congressional oversight.

That is the attorney general of the United States saying he decided to take his job because he has an agenda he wants to satisfy.

The Post’s Tom Hamburger did yeoman’s work last week laying out how long Barr has subscribed to an expansive view of executive authority. This has been evident since the last time he joined the Justice Department in 1989. His Democratic successor as the head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, Walter Dellinger, told my colleague ""there is nobody who is to his right on this issue.”

So it’s hardly surprising that Barr believes in this. But believing in it is different from suggesting your decisions as attorney general are shaped by it. Imagine if Barack Obama had picked Eric Holder to lead the Justice Department, and Holder came out and said he wanted to be attorney general to protect Obama’s prerogatives — not because of Obama, mind you, but because of the presidency. Imagine if George W. Bush picked Alberto Gonzales, and Gonzales soon declared that he wanted the job because he felt there was too much scrutiny of Bush’s war powers, and he wanted to set things straight.

Barr seems to believe his quest is just and apolitical because it’s not about Donald Trump, but rather protecting the presidency as an institution. But it’s going to be pretty difficult to not measure his decisions against the outcome he set out to satisfy. Whenever there is a judgment call involving presidential powers, what is Barr going to do if he believes the presidency as an institution is under assault from the meddling legislative branch? He’s going to err on the side of the presidency — and therefore, of Trump.

The writing was on the wall for all of this. Barr wrote that long memo decrying special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s obstruction of justice probe. He said there was more evidence to investigate conspiracy theories involving the Clintons than there was to investigate potential Trump campaign collusion with Russia. He said Trump had ""made the right call” by firing FBI Director James B. Comey.

But to come out and say you came to Washington to protect the presidency in your role as the nation’s top law enforcement official — rather than simply to enforce the law — is quite a bold statement."
DHS warns of data threat from Chinese-made drones,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-china/u-s-dhs-warns-of-data-threat-from-chinese-made-drones-idUSKCN1SQ1ZY,"FILE PHOTO: U.S. Department of Homeland Security emblem is pictured at the National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) located just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia September 24, 2010. REUTERS/Hyungwon Kang/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones, according to a notice reviewed by Reuters on Monday.

The notice, titled “Chinese Manufactured Unmanned Aircraft Systems,” warned that U.S. officials have “strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access.”

A spokeswoman for DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed that it “recently released an industry alert providing organizations with information related to the inherit risks associated with using UAS technology manufactured in China and measures to reduce such risk.”

The notice, which did not name any companies, was reported earlier by CNN. It urged companies to “be aware of whether your UAS data is being stored by the vendor or other third parties. If it is being stored, find out how, where, and for how long.”

This is the latest concern raised by the U.S. government about the threats of Chinese-made devices. On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 68 affiliates to an export blacklist, citing the risk of to U.S. national security from the telecommunications network equipment maker.

China’s SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, the world’s largest maker of consumer drones, said in a statement on Monday that “the security of our technology has been independently verified by the U.S. government and leading U.S. businesses.”

The company added that it gives “customers full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted.” It said that for government and critical infrastructure customers, “we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet.”"
Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""
The Justice Department might kill T-Mobile and Sprint’s merger despite likely FCC approval,https://www.theverge.com,['May'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632938/justice-department-against-tmobile-sprint-merger-deal-block-fcc,"T-Mobile and Sprint started the day with very good news when FCC chairman Ajit Pai said he would urge the commission to approve their industry-transforming merger. Stocks of both companies soared soon after. But only a few hours later, Bloomberg is reporting that the US Department of Justice is leaning toward blocking the merger over antitrust concerns. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that the Justice Department remains unconvinced that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint would be a positive development for consumers.

Citing a person familiar with the DoJ’s ongoing merger review, Bloomberg says that “the remedies proposed by the companies don’t go far enough to resolve antitrust concerns.” T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to several “enforceable” commitments and milestones on 5G deployment throughout the US in order to gain the FCC’s thumbs-up on the deal; Boost Mobile will also be sold off if the merger is successful. In a video, T-Mobile CEO John Legere insisted that the combined company would face hefty financial penalties if it fails to meet those 5G buildout goals. He also again pledged that consumers wouldn’t face higher mobile plan prices for at least three years.

But the Justice Department’s antitrust division is the crucial hurdle — and a bigger one than the FCC in this case — that T-Mobile and Sprint must overcome if they want to see the $26.5 billion merger through. Those same conditions that Pai found acceptable might not be enough to get a stamp of approval from antitrust officials. Trading of Sprint’s stock was briefly halted for volatility on Monday afternoon after Bloomberg’s story was published.

Both T-Mobile and Sprint say their coming together is critical for the United States to be a leader in 5G mobile networking and to present a more formidable competitor to larger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Critics maintain that shrinking the number of major US mobile providers from four down to three will result in higher prices and lost jobs, regardless of what T-Mobile and Sprint are promising. When The Wall Street Journal originally reported that the Justice Department was turning against the merger, Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure strongly pushed back against the story and claimed it was inaccurate. But now Bloomberg is corroborating that this thing is still far from a certainty."
Trump administration will hire Cuccinelli for senior DHS border role,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'Nick Miroff', 'Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement', 'Drug Trafficking', 'National Security', 'May At Pm']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-hired-cuccinelli-for-senior-dhs-border-role/2019/05/21/f9272ddc-7be1-11e9-a66c-d36e482aa873_story.html,"The Trump administration will hire conservative firebrand and former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II to coordinate immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security, three administration officials said Tuesday.

Cuccinelli will work at DHS in a senior role and will report to acting DHS secretary Kevin ­McAleenan, while also providing regular briefings to President Trump at the White House, according two officials briefed on the appointment.

The hiring is the latest DHS leadership shuffle by the White House, which is desperate to contain a record-breaking influx of Central American families that has pushed border crossings to the highest level in a dozen years. Frustrated with his administration’s inability to stem the crisis, Trump has sacked top Homeland Security officials and demanded a “tougher” response.

Cuccinelli, who has been hawkish on immigration policy during television appearances that also praise Trump, appears to fulfill the president’s desire to have a forceful personality and a loyalist at the highest levels of DHS. But his arrival risks new instability at the agency, coming six weeks after Trump ousted Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and replaced her with McAleenan, a long-serving official who was confirmed by the Senate last year as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and who is one of the few administration figures who retains a favorable reputation with lawmakers from both parties.

Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank whose immigration-reduction agenda has had significant influence in the White House, called Cuccinelli “an unusual choice.”

“He doesn’t have any immigration experience, but he does have law enforcement experience,” said Krikorian, who said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the appointment would make a difference. The crucial factor, he predicted, would be access to the White House.

“If he does not answer directly to the president, he’s not likely to be able to get much done,” he said.

[Before Trump’s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass arrests]

Before leaving DHS, Nielsen had advocated for the designation of a policy coordinator at the White House who would streamline communications and planning among the various federal agencies responding to the situation at the border, including the Departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security.

The official said Nielsen wanted the coordinator to work out of the White House, not at DHS. “There is no one coordinating policy across the government,” the official said. “You have 10 people coordinating it.”

The White House offered the job to Cuccinelli after it was turned down by Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to two officials. Trump also soured weeks ago on Kris Kobach, the Kansas Republican favored by immigration restrictionist groups, according to one senior administration official.

Cuccinelli will do the job from DHS, filling a role that would otherwise be McAleenan’s, which sets up potential conflicts.

“It is bad news for [McAleenan],” said one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide candid views. “You have someone at the agency that the White House might have in mind to be the next DHS secretary.”

Another former department official predicted Cuccinelli’s lack of authority at the agency and distance from the White House would leave him in a weak position from the outset.

“Putting an immigration czar at DHS is a total waste,” the person said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about Cuccinelli’s role. Cuccinelli, who was at the White House on Monday, could not be reached for comment. His expected hiring was first reported by the New York Times.

If the White House is grooming him as a possible replacement for McAleenan, he would face a difficult path to confirmation.

Cuccinelli is deeply disliked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post for leading efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.

Two years ago, Cuccinelli signed a letter drafted by GOP activists calling on McConnell to step down.

When Cuccinelli’s name surfaced last month as a potential Nielsen replacement, McConnell told reporters he’d conveyed his unease to the White House. “I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them . . . Ken Cuccinelli,” McConnell said.

The Virginia conservative, who has a long record of combative television appearances, is even less popular with Democrats. “This is absurd and outrageous,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) wrote on Twitter. “He doesn’t deserve a taxpayer-funded salary.”

Others more supportive of the move noted that the DHS secretary’s role is challenging enough when there isn’t a migration crisis — and with hurricane season approaching, McAleenan could benefit from a strong personality fully devoted to the border.

In April, more than 100,000 migrants were taken into custody along the U.S.-Mexico border for the second consecutive month, and the numbers in May are on pace to go even higher. McAleenan warned in late March that U.S. agents and infrastructure at the border had hit a “breaking point,” and since then the situation has worsened, leaving holding cells so overcrowded that DHS officials have been transferring migrants out of South Texas by aircraft simply to make room for ever-growing numbers of new arrivals.

[From the border, more frustrating immigration numbers for Trump]

Cuccinelli has been a vocal advocate for Trump’s proposed border wall and other measures popular with hard-liners. He has backed constitutional changes to restrict birthright citizenship, urged lawsuits against employers who hire undocumented immigrants and at one point supported denying immigrant workers — including those in the country lawfully — from collecting unemployment benefits if they are fired for not speaking English on the job.

His appointment to DHS has others in the administration worried there will be too many players fighting to establish control over an immigration agenda, with White House adviser Stephen Miller already chafing officials at DHS.

One White House adviser said Cuccinelli would advocate for the White House’s aggressive position at the agency. Miller has argued to Trump that others within DHS are trying to stall him.

[Acting Secretary blocked Stephen Miller’s bid for new DHS shake-up]

McAleenan last week pushed back at an attempt by Miller to have Trump’s pick to lead ICE installed at CBP instead. In a tense White House meeting Thursday, McAleenan said he needed control over DHS to remain in his job, administration officials said.

The animus between Cuccinelli and Senate Republicans stems from his leadership of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which organized anti-incumbent efforts, and from his role at the 2016 Republican convention, when he derided “petty, tyrannical rules” and threw his ID badge on the floor in protest of Trump’s nomination. He was a strong supporter of the presidential bid by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has since become one of Trump’s most ardent defenders.

Another senior administration official who welcomed the appointment said there was an acute need for someone to be an immigration policy field marshal.

“The president’s frustration is not directed at DHS alone,” the official said. “It’s DOJ, DOD, State. So this job will ensure closer coordination at a senior level, and it’s an effort to acknowledge you need someone who can have conversations with department heads about policies and drive them to the same place.”

But the official also acknowledged that Cuccinelli’s appointment risked undercutting ­McAleenan at a time when the acting secretary has been making inroads with lawmakers, including Democrats who see him as a neutral law enforcement official rather than a White House political operative.

“I don’t see how this appointment makes things better on the Hill,” the official said."
There's a huge loophole in a new DOJ filing that Trump cited to block Don McGahn from testifying before Congress,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/justice-department-olc-memo-don-mcgahn-2019-5,"The White House announced on Monday that President Donald Trump instructed the former White House counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony related to the Russia investigation.

In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to a new memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel ""stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly.""

Indeed, the memo said, ""Congress may not constitutionally compel the President's senior advisers to testify about their official duties.""

But legal experts were quick to point out the opinion doesn't account for one important possibility: McGahn choosing to testify before lawmakers.

'McGahn does NOT have to comply with Trump's instruction'

""The key here is what the OLC opinion does not say — that McGahn can be barred from voluntarily testifying before Congress,"" Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, wrote on Twitter. ""All it says on that front is that he can't be punished for refusing to testify (Part IV), not that the President has any means of stopping him from doing so.""

""Whether or not the OLC opinion is correct that McGahn can't be punished for refusing to testify (which is the weakest part of the analysis, in my view), there's nothing in these 15 pages that remotely supports the idea that McGahn can somehow be 'blocked from testifying,'"" Vladeck added.

Eric Columbus, who served as senior counsel to the deputy attorney general under former President Barack Obama, echoed that view, tweeting, ""McGahn does NOT have to comply with Trump's instruction.""

The OLC memo said, ""Coercing senior presidential advisers into situations where they must repeatedly decline to provide answers, citing executive privilege, would be inefficient and contrary to good-faith governance.""

But ""executive privilege has no force against a former employee who wants to testify,"" Columbus tweeted.

Read more:The FBI's former top lawyer said Mueller's obstruction findings are 'alarming' and show a 'pattern of corruption'

He also said McGahn cannot assert attorney-client privilege in refusing to testify because the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that there is no attorney-client privilege between the White House counsel and the president.

But McGahn does have an incentive to comply with Trump's order

But several observers said McGahn has incentive to comply with Trump's order, even if he isn't legally required to. McGahn is a prominent player in Republican political circles, and defying the White House could not only put his own career at risk but also prompt the president and his allies to urge others to boycott McGahn's law firm, Jones Day.

Indeed, McGahn has walked a tightrope since the special counsel Robert Mueller's final report in the Russia investigation was released. Though prosecutors did not make a decision on whether Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice, the document laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence against the president, much of which came from McGahn when he testified for over 30 hours to Mueller's office.

Trump and his lawyers promptly attacked McGahn's credibility and accused him of falsifying his testimony. Though McGahn's lawyer said in a statement that what his client told Mueller was true — and backed up by corroborating evidence — he emphasized that ""Don, nonetheless, appreciates that the President gave him the opportunity to serve as White House Counsel, and assist him with his signature accomplishments.""

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, highlighted how McGahn is likely to comply with Trump's order.

The probable solution, he added, is that ""Democrats will have to hold him in contempt and then go to court to compel his testimony."""
Corn: Flawed USDA Forecast Creates Tremendous Opportunity,https://seekingalpha.com,['Atlas Research'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4265517-corn-flawed-usda-forecast-creates-tremendous-opportunity,"Normally, incompetence costs you dearly... but on May 10th, government incompetence created tremendous opportunity.

Regular readers know that I often disagree with government forecasts. Last month, I argued that the energy information agency (""EIA"") is likely overestimating the new supply coming from U.S. gas producers this year. You see, in my experience, government forecasters often simply extrapolate the prevailing trends into the future. Shale drillers supplied a lot of new gas in 2018... so why not just project more of the same in 2019? I detailed the evidence indicating why that projection was likely wrong in last month's article. So far, the available data confirms that gas production growth has slowed to a crawl in 2019.

In the case of the corn market, government forecasters simply plugged in an expected yield for this year's corn crop that closely matched the yield of previous years. Now in a normal year, this method of extrapolation might work out just fine. But 2019 is no normal year...

In this article, I'll explain why the USDA simply got it wrong with their latest estimate for corn yield, and thus corn production, for the current corn crop. And I'll show how this faulty forecast created a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn (NYSEARCA:CORN) market.

First, let's start with a basic overview of today's corn market.

Corn Supply and Demand Overview

Like any other commodity, analyzing the corn market is all about estimating future supply and demand. U.S. corn demand typically fluctuates by 1-2% annually, with longer-term corn demand driven by GDP and population growth. Shorter-term fluctuations can be influenced by changes in ethanol consumption since corn-based ethanol is used as a gasoline additive. Corn demand also fluctuates with shorter-term changes in consumption for livestock feed and exports.

For the 2018/2019 corn crop year (August 2018 through September 2019), the USDA estimates total corn consumption of 14.5 billion bushels. That's down 2% from 14.8 billion bushels last year, due to a 150 million decline in corn for ethanol production and a 138 million drop in corn exports. For the upcoming 2019/2020 crop year, the USDA forecasts corn demand growth of 1.2% to 14.7 billion bushels, boosted by higher feed demand and a rebound in corn usage for ethanol production.

Of course, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has created a lot of headline hype in the agriculture sector. And yes, some crops have taken a big hit from Chinese buyers pulling out of the market, namely soybeans. But the U.S. corn crop remains insulated from these trade tensions. Why? For one, U.S. corn exports to China have already suffered a more than 90% decline over the last several years:

The reasons for this drop are beyond the scope of this article. But here's the bottom line...

The U.S. consumes roughly 80% of its 14-15 billion bushels of its domestic corn production annually. And of the 2.3 billion bushels that we sold abroad last year, China bought just 15 million bushels. That's less than 1% of total U.S. corn exports and only 0.1% of total U.S. production. In other words, even a full-blown trade war would have little direct impact on the American corn market.

So there shouldn't be any big surprises in the demand picture this year. That leaves supply as the key factor driving corn prices today. And this is where the trade war has created an indirect headwind for corn prices. Let me explain...

Low Soybean Prices = More Corn Planting

Each year, many American farmers have the choice between growing corn or soybeans on their farmland. And unlike corn, trade tensions have dealt a major blow to U.S. soybean exports, pushing prices down to around $8 per bushel - the lowest level in over a decade. Depressed soybean prices have incentivized farmers to switch from soybeans to corn for the 2019/2020 crop year.

According to the latest USDA estimates, soybean acreage will drop from 89.2 million acres last year to 84.6 million acres this year, while corn acreage will rise from 89.1 million acres to 92.8 million acres. This 92.8 million planted acres translate into 85.4 million harvested acres, assuming normal crop loss rates. And if you assume a normal yield of 176 bushels per harvested acre, that means U.S. corn farmers will grow 15 billion bushels of corn this year - up 4.2% from last year's 14.4 billion bushel crop.

This projected production growth will handily outpace the expected 1.2% increase in consumption, thereby driving up corn ""ending stocks"" (the official term for corn inventories) to a massive 2.485 billion bushels, based on the following USDA projections:

The chart below puts this 2.485 billion bushel estimate for corn ending stocks into historical perspective...

So it's no surprise that corn prices tanked immediately following the release of these estimates in the USDA's most recent WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th. Prices fell from $3.54 to as low as $3.45 on the heels of that report and continued dropping to $3.43 the following Monday morning, exacerbated by escalating trade war rhetoric over the weekend.

For those who follow me on Twitter you may have seen me release the following tweet and chart, alerting my followers of a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn market on Monday morning:

""#Corn capitulation creating terrific opportunity to harvest irrational trade war-inspired volatility this morning. #bullish""

And here's what happened next…

By aggressively selling put options on corn futures, I captured thousands of dollars in option premiums in just a few trading days last week. I don't say this to brag...ok, maybe a little. But more importantly, I want to point out that commodity markets and government forecasters can occasionally get things very, very wrong. And when they do, you can make a lot of money by simply adding two and two together to get four. That's precisely what I did when analyzing the corn market last week. Here's the simple math I used to figure that the fear in the corn market was unjustified…

Basic Logic Shows the Fallacy of the USDA's 2019 Corn Yield Forecast

Each month, the USDA puts out a monthly WASDE (World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate) report estimating supply and demand for agricultural products, including corn. The following excerpt below from the latest WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th, which details how U.S. corn inventories would balloon to the aforementioned multi-decade high level of 2,485 million bushels. In this report, the USDA made one key assumption when calculating this year's production - a normal yield (circled in red) based on ""assuming normal mid-May planting progress"" (highlighted in yellow):

And that single assumption was all I needed to know that the USDA's forecaster inventory number was completely unrealistic and just plain way too bearish. Why? Two words: late planting.

You see, each year corn farmers have a brief 8-9 week window from early April through May 20th to get their crops planted if they hope to achieve optimal yields. Any corn planted after May 20th is officially considered ""late planted"" corn, as yields begin dropping for corn planted after this date. That's why crop insurance payouts begin dropping for corn planted after a specific cut-off date, typically in late May or early June.

So getting back to the USDA report, the following chart shows why it's simply absurd for the USDA to assume ""normal mid-May planting progress"" for 2019:

With just a few weeks left in the planting season, 2019's corn planting progress is nowhere near ""normal"". Farmers have only planted 30% of their planned acreage as of May 12th. That's more than 50% behind schedule compared to the five-year average. Thanks to the extreme rains that inundated the Midwest corn belt states this spring, many farmers trying to get their seed into the ground have found themselves in situations like this:

Simply put, too much water in the soil means farmers can't get their seeds into the ground. To get a sense of the extreme difficulty corn farmers have had this planting season, let's zoom to see where 2019's planting progress falls for this time of year (Week 19) compared with the last 40 years:

At just 30% of the corn crop planted by week 13, we've only seen two other years in the last 40 with less corn planting progress - 28% in 2013 and 29% in 1984. So to summarize…

The USDA created the market perception that U.S. corn inventories would soar to a multi-decade high by the end of 2019's crop season. But that projection was based on the ridiculous assumption of ""normal mid-May planting progress"". And I just showed how 2019 is very, very far removed from normal.

Now, the real question becomes - what's a more reasonable yield estimate given the large amount of corn that will likely be planted late (or not at all)? This article provides a great analysis of the historical impact that late planting has on U.S. corn yields. The key conclusion is summarized in the chart below, which shows that corn yields typically suffer a minor drop in yields when the amount of late planting exceeds the average by less than 10%. But when the deviation exceeds 10%, the yield decline goes exponential - dropping anywhere from 10-20 bushels per acre in the extreme cases.

So far, all signs point towards 2019 falling on the far right side of the graph. That means a big downside risk to corn yields. Based on the study's historical regression model, a conservative estimate would translate into a drop in yields of anywhere from 5-10 bushels per acre… and I wouldn't be surprised to see it come out much worse.

Now, the caveat here is that summer weather will provide the other critical variable in determining this year's corn yield. But no one trading corn today has any degree of certainty what the 2019 summer weather will look like. What we do know for sure is that corn farmers are way behind schedule with their planting this year. It's flat-out wrong to expect a normal yield based on the information available today.

So let's take a conservative estimate of losing 6 bushels per acre due to the extreme amount of late planting likely in 2019. That would lower the USDA's 2019 production estimate by roughly half a billion bushels to roughly 14,500 million bushels, based on the following math:

This 170 bushels per acre yield assumption creates a much less bearish ending stock number of 1,972 million bushels - a four-year low instead of the USDA's multi-decade high:

When using this conservative yield and ending stocks assumption, it's clear that corn prices trading well below the typical range of the last four years was way out of line with reality last week. The red line shows how far below the normal price range corn prices fell to last week, creating a tremendous contrarian buying opportunity when corn briefly traded below $3.50 per bushel:

It didn't take long for the market to realize the fallacy of the USDA forecast and irrational trade war fears. Corn prices have already rallied more than 10% off last Monday's lows. At just over $3.90 per bushel, I don't see a screaming opportunity to get long at today's levels. But on any pullbacks below the average price of the last four years, I'll be on the lookout to capture volatility through selling put options or getting long corn futures.

Going forward, there's a significant chance for a tail-risk event in U.S. corn supply, and thus much higher prices, if continued wet weather keeps farmers away from their fields in the few weeks left in the planting season. Meanwhile, summer weather will provide another wildcard that could either overcome the headwinds from late planting with benign growing conditions or create a meaningful supply shortage with harsh summer weather.

Subscribe for future updates and potential opportunities that might arise from further irrationality in today's corn market. And when the USDA releases its next corn supply and demand forecast, pay close attention to key assumptions driving their estimates... it just might create another terrific contrarian opportunity.

I have nothing against old people — I'm one of them. But maybe it's time to add a maximum age limit to our minimum age requirement for our presidents.

Next month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.

That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.

The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.

You don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign

I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.

Growing up in the analogue era

In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures (for example, in 1970, I moved to a beach in Sinaloa, Mexico, instead of going to college). As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D.C., with a grown-up career.

President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.

It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, ""the sky was the limit.""

Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn’t go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.

While not everyone’s history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today’s spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.

Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D.C., in Burlington, Vermont Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).

Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders’ similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, “bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier.”

This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman’s humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist “vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the … suffocating force of the status quo.”

Business values of the 1980s

While Sanders was stewing over the meaning of his life in the mid-1980s, 300 miles south, Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4.5 million a year from his father’s clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.

Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for “getting even.”

Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1.17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.

In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were “entitled to massive write-offs,"" and ""you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes."" Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common “sport” among real estate developers.

Thanks to my generation’s harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That’s as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.

The future might rest on electing a sufficiently “woke” candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.

Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I’ll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.

For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)

The Department of Defense said Tuesday that potential threats from Iran have been “put on hold” thanks to precautionary measures taken by the U.S.

“We have put on hold the potential for attacks on Americans,” Acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan said at the Pentagon.

The U.S. deployed four B-52 bombers, Patriot air-defense missiles, and the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier-strike group to the Persian Gulf earlier this month amid fears that Iran was transporting short-range ballistic missiles in the region. Shanahan cited “indications of a credible threat by Iranian regime forces” in justifying the move.

The State Department last week ordered all non-critical government employees to leave Iraq, saying the tensions with neighboring Iran could endanger Americans in the area. Additionally, a rocket was fired Sunday night which landed less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, and no casualties occurred.

“There haven’t been any attacks on Americans,” Shanahan confirmed. “That doesn’t mean that the threats that we’ve previously identified have gone away. Our prudent response, I think, has given the Iranians time to recalculate. I think our response was a measure of our will and our resolve that we will protect our people and our interests in the region.”

“I just hope Iran is listening,” Shanahan added, vowing that any attack by Iran on U.S. assets “will be met obviously with great force.”"

The change would drastically lower an estimate made last year by the Trump administration that as many as 1,400 more people could die prematurely each year under a proposed new rule on emissions from coal plants. Lowering the projections would make it much easier to defend the new regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule. “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” said Richard L.

Deadline ends for Alabama to meet DOJ demands on prisons,https://www.al.com,"['Mike Cason', 'Mcason Al.Com']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/doj-notification-period-on-alabama-prisons-coming-to-end.html,"It’s been seven weeks since the U.S. Department of Justice notified Gov. Kay Ivey of allegations that conditions in Alabama’s men’s prisons violate the Constitution because of the level of violence, sexual abuse and other problems.

The notification said the DOJ could file a lawsuit at the end of a 49-day period if the state’s response to the allegations is inadequate.

The 49-day notification is required under the federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, CRIPA.

Jay Town, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, issued a statement today in response to a question about the notification period ending. The three U.S. attorneys in Alabama were involved in the two-year investigation of prisons that led to the allegations and Town is working with state officials on the response and remedies.

“We are encouraged with the current progress of our negotiations with the State,” Town said in the statement. ""It is too early in this process, however, to determine whether there will be a need for CRIPA litigation. The Department remains hopeful that such a step will be unnecessary.”

Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who has been involved in the state’s response, had said earlier today he was not expecting a lawsuit, at least not immediately.

“We’ve had some very good conversations with DOJ and they know that we’re committed to working our way through this and trying to comply with some of their concerns,” Ward said. “I do not expect a lawsuit, at all. And they’ve been very reassuring on that. Now that’s not a guarantee.”

The DOJ could file a lawsuit later. The 49-day period was a minimum notification period before doing so.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers held a press conference last week about the prison issues.

They say the problems would be best addressed in a special session. Ivey has not said whether she will call a special session.

The governor issued a statement last week on the state’s longstanding problem with overcrowded, understaffed and dangerous prisons, saying, “This problem has been kicked down the road for the last time.”

“I am encouraged to know that the Legislature will continue to work on solutions during the remainder of this session, we will remain in constant communication with one another during the coming weeks and months to keep this issue on the front burner,"" Ivey said in the statement.

Legislators have nine meeting days left in the regular session, counting today. The session must end by June 17.

Bob Horton, spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, issued a statement about the notification period coming to an end.

“There is no 49-day deadline for enacting changes, nor is there a requirement that DOJ file a lawsuit,” Horton said. ""Since issuance of the findings letter, the State and the DOJ have engaged in collaborative communications seeking to jointly address the issues outlined in the DOJ’s findings letter.

“Even before the DOJ released its report, ADOC recognized the magnitude and scope of the challenges facing our Department. We have been working to identify and implement solutions to these issues and address long-established challenges that impact our prisons and inmate population. With Governor Ivey’s leadership and the partnership of our state legislature, we will continue to forge ahead to reform and reshape corrections in Alabama.”

Contributing columnist

The Office of Legal Counsel offered more cause for concern last week that politics is playing an undue role at the Justice Department. The office, which is charged with providing the executive branch neutral legal advice, issued an opinion that the Food and Drug Administration has no authority to regulate drugs used in lethal injection.

The OLC opinion was clearly designed to break through the legal logjam that has prevented states from using lethal injection drugs in executions — and it uses Evel Kneivel-style logical leaps to get there.

Lethal injections, such as the three-drug cocktail sodium thiopental, have become the primary method of execution in the United States. Of the 292 executions in the last 10 years, 289 have employed such chemicals.

U.S. drug manufacturers, not wanting their products to be associated with executions, stopped making thiopental 10 years ago, forcing states to acquire the killing drugs overseas. This move has generated legal trouble, however, as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits misbranded drugs from entering interstate commerce, including any drug not manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA. The statute also prohibits the use of an unapproved new drug that the FDA has not blessed as safe and effective for its proposed use.

Based on these legal provisions, a group of convicts on death row sued the FDA in 2011 and gained an injunction requiring the administration to prevent the entry of foreign-manufactured thiopental on the grounds that it was unapproved and misbranded. It also had to tell state correctional departments that the use of the drug was prohibited by law under threat of civil and criminal penalties.

That injunction remains in effect today. Among other things, it has put the FDA and death-penalty states such as Texas at loggerheads.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion, authored by its well-respected head lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, attempts to take the FDA’s foot off the throat of death-penalty states. Engel points to FDA v. Brown & Williamson, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court found that the FDA lacks regulatory authority over tobacco products as “drugs” or “devices” (Congress later granted the agency power to regulate them directly), to argue that the FDA similarly cannot regulate sodium thiopental’s use in executions. The supposition is that when used for executions, the substance is intended to kill the prisoner, so by definition the drug is not “safe” or “effective.”

But this reasoning is tendentious. Nowhere in Brown & Williamson did the court suggest that the law inherently did not cover tobacco products; rather, the court held that, lacking any safer effective use, the FDA could only regulate the products by banning them, which Congress expressly forbade. Congress has not, however, forbidden the FDA from banning the use of sodium thiopental in executions.

The OLC opinion tries to get around this problem by lumping sodium thiopental in with other means of executions — electric chairs, gallows or firing squads — that “are intended to affect the function or structure of the body,” which is one of the definitions of a “drug.” Thus, Engel argues, the FDA would have to ban all means of execution, whereas “the Constitution and laws of the United States presuppose the continued availability of capital punishment.”

This is a massive logical leap. Among other problems, it assumes that there cannot be a “safe and effective” drug in executions, but the whole point of lethal injection is to provide a safe and effective form of execution — not, of course, to extend life but to promote a humane and predictable death rather than the ghoulish lottery of untested, potentially painful drugs.

Moreover, all the opinions in the litigation that resulted in the 2011 injunction, as well as previous opinions in the Supreme Court, concluded that the FDA’s jurisdiction over drugs extends to sodium thiopental. Even Texas expressly conceded it in the injunction litigation. The OLC opinion also sidesteps the immense implications of its reasoning for the FDA’s regulation of drugs for physician-assisted suicide, animal euthanasia or recreation.

So why would OLC issue such a strained opinion? First clue: The heading of the opinion makes clear that it was ordered up by the attorney general, which is relatively rare. And a footnote states that OLC “considered” the views of the FDA. Reading between the lines, it’s a decent bet that OLC rejected the FDA’s arguments.

Apart from disarming the FDA, the opinion removes the threat of civil and even criminal liability under the FDCA for state officials who buy and use the foreign-manufactured drugs.

Finally, the OLC opinion could potentially serve as the basis for a motion to dissolve or amend the 2011 injunction. Death penalty states could argue to the court that the FDA’s jurisdiction is a threshold issue not previously considered, and the opinion here, being an official statement of the executive branch, would carry more weight than a simple argument in a brief.

None of this would be so worrisome if the opinion represented the sort of nonpartisan legal interpretation that the OLC is charged with providing. But the opinion, not least because of its dubious legal analysis, bears the distinct scent of a preferred political solution. Given the concern that the Justice Department has become a political tool for the administration, it’s yet another worrisome indication that the norms of our institutions are eroding.

"WV MetroNews Suit led by Jay Justice claims OSM broke settlement deal, preempts another federal lawsuit",http://wvmetronews.com,['Brad Mcelhinny'],05-21-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/21/suit-led-by-jay-justice-claims-osm-broke-settlement-deal-preempts-another-federal-lawsuit/,"By Brad McElhinny in News | May 21, 2019 at 3:41PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Companies owned by the family of Gov. Jim Justice have filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Surface Mining, apparently preempting another impending lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The lawsuit by Justice companies contends the agency acted in bad faith by reversing course on a settlement deal. Lawyers for the Justice companies also insinuate the federal government may be acting out a political vendetta.

This is the second legal showdown this month between Justice companies and an agency of the federal government over defaulting penalties.

A separate lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Mine Safety and Health Administration was filed on May 7. That one contended Justice companies owe $4.7 million for 2,297 citations over five years.

That action is an aspect of why Justice companies contend they are being treated unfairly.

Office of the Governor Gov. Jim Justice

Governor Justice described unnamed political forces on May 8 when reporters asked for his reaction to the MSHA lawsuit.

“You know, we’re getting ready to go into an election year. You don’t really know where stuff comes from,” the governor said. “But at the end of the day, we’ll take care of our obligations. We always have and we always will.”

The lawsuit filed May 17 by Justice companies against the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement also makes reference to possible political motives.

The lawsuit contends the two parties had agreed to settle fines, reclamation fees and penalties when that agency suddenly started playing hardball.

“The abrupt turnaround by the government in its attitude toward this matter is inexplicable and raises the question whether untoward political or other pressure from sources presently unknown has been brought to bear on OSMRE, perhaps from other federal agencies or political adversaries of the Justice family,” the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Senior Judge Glen Conrad was assigned.

Documents within the filing allude to a possible impending lawsuit against Justice companies by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of OSM. If so, that would mirror the earlier lawsuit on behalf of MSHA.

An attached May 13 letter by Mike Carey, a lawyer for Justice and his companies, is addressed to the U.S. Department of Interior.

“I understand from discussions with your office last week that the filing of one or more complaints is imminent,” Carey wrote. “This is of grave concern and bewilderment to my clients. We believe it is unecessary, as we have now met every term your requested to settle this matter.

“If a file has been forwarded to the Department of Justice, I request that this correspondence be immediately provided to the individuals working on this matter and that they be notified we have agreed to all of the OSM’s settlement demands.”

Carey also represents the Justice companies on the MSHA lawsuit. And he represents the Governor’s Office on the lawsuit over whether Justice violates the state Constitution’s requirement to reside at the seat of government. Plus the Governor’s Office used Carey’s firm last year to investigate its own Department of Commerce.

A response to Carey by the Department of the Interior on May 15 also alludes to an impending federal lawsuit.

“Yesterday afternoon, a letter authorizing DOJ to file suit against the Justice Companies on behalf of the Department of Interior was signed and sent (the end of a process that has taken months to accomplish — the MSHA lawsuit plays no part in DOI’s referral to DOJ),” wrote John Austin of the Interior department.

“If your clients want to settle these cases before suit is filed, please make an offer that we can discuss with DOJ.”

The lawsuit filed by Justice companies contends another federal lawsuit would further damage the companies’ reputation.

“Any suit filed by the government in contravention of the Settlement Agreement would create a false impression and arguably be defamatory in that it would cause harm to the business and personal reputations of the Plaintiffs,” lawyers for the Justice companies wrote.

This has resulted from dozens of violations by several Justice companies recorded by OSM in recent years. A spreadsheet in the filing lists 114, but does not indicate their nature or a dollar value.

Eleven of the violations name Jay Justice, the governor’s son who runs the coal operation.

“For what is believed to be the first time ever, the OSMRE also wrongfully assessed a series of individual assessments against Jay Justice personally, allegedly relating to the activities of the Justice Mining Entities,” according to the lawsuit by Justice companies.

Negotiations by Justice company representatives, including Jay, and officials with OSM picked up in early April, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says Jay Justice and Tom Lusk, chief operating officer of Justice Mining Entities, met with Michael Castle, the field office director for OSM in Knoxville and Lexington, plus Mark Snyder, also with OSM.

The lawsuit indicates they meet several times April 8, sometimes with counsel and sometimes without.

Much of the conversation focused on Justice companies completing reclamation work in lieu of financial penalties. Part of the negotiation focused on whether the companies would need to provide additional financial information or collateral.

By late that month, according to Justice companies, significant expense had been expended to move equipment and start the reclamation work.

This month, according to Justice companies, the attitude of the federal government seemed to change.

“In the week of May 6, 2019, the government’s attitude toward the Justice Mining Entities noticeably soured,” lawyers for the company stated, noting the lawsuit that was filed by MSHA and the Department of Justice.

That filing prompted Austin of the Department of Interior to question whether Justice companies would be able to perform their duties under the settlement agreement, according to the Justice lawsuit.

In the May 15 letter, Austin stated that there had not been an authorized agreement to settle the penalties with OSM.

“I need to reiterate what you and your clients have been told: Neither OSMRe nor any of its employees nor the attorneys representing the Secretary of the Interior have authority to settle a debt owed to the United States that exceeds $100,000 without the approval of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice companies contended that playing hardball will mean the loss of mining jobs.

“As the plaintiffs previously made OMSRE and its attorneys aware, preceding litigiously instead of in accordance with the Settlement Agreement harms the operations of a dozen or so mining companies and risks the jobs of hundred of workers on the pending reclamation projects,” Justice company lawyers wrote.

The Department of Interior would like proof. It wants financial statements and any other information the company can provide to demonstrate a settlement is in the best interest of citizens.

“We will also need documentation of your belief that a settlement will preserve 450 jobs.”

After gaining the victim's trust, the perpetrator describes a minor hardship and persuades the victim to sent them a small amount of money.

The release says a fraudster then calls the victim the following day, claiming to be an employee of DHS or another law enforcement agency. DHS says the fraudsters spoof the caller ID of legitimate law enforcement phone numbers, and tells the victim the funds they sent the day before went to a criminal organization or terrorist group, such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and threatens them with arrest and imprisonment.

The fraudsters then direct the victim to contact a ""lawyer"" who can help them, and the ""lawyer"" then instructs the victim to pay $1,000 or more as a ""retainer.""

DHS says the Office of Inspector General is investigating the situation, but reminds the public that law enforcement and other government agency phone numbers may be used by the fraudsters in the scam. The release warns people to not provide any personal information when receiving calls from these numbers.

The release says people should remember that legitimate law enforcement callers will never ask you to pay fines over the phone or request money from you. If you question the validity of the call, you're urged to call the relevant field office number of the agency that called and ask to be put in touch with the individual who called you.

Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido’s ambassador to Washington, said in a message on Twitter that the talks held at the State Department had been “very positive” but offered no further details. “We continue to advance,” he said.

The talks were arranged at the request of Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

The United States and many European and Latin American countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader. But Maduro retains control of state functions and the support of the military’s top brass, as well as allies such as Russia, Cuba and China.

The purpose of Monday’s meeting was to discuss the U.S. Defense Department’s “past and future role related to humanitarian assistance and regional support,” a State Department official said ahead of the talks.

President Donald Trump and senior aides have not ruled out military action in the crisis-stricken South American country, repeatedly saying that “all options are on the table.”

But Washington has made clear it prefers to exert continued economic and diplomatic pressure to push Maduro out, and many experts have said the U.S. use of military force is unlikely."
Wall Street Weighs the Chances of Sprint Deal With FCC and DOJ at Odds,https://finance.yahoo.com,['Kamaron Leach'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-weighs-chances-sprint-165412975.html,"Wall Street Weighs the Chances of Sprint Deal With FCC and DOJ at Odds

(Bloomberg) -- The Justice Department’s leaning against the union of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. drew in mixed reactions on Wall Street. While the fate of T-Mobile’s takeover remains in limbo, Raymond James says the Federal Communications Commission going public first with its official recommendation of approval “seems unusual to us and indicates the political nature of the process.”

As a presidential election draws near, a politically charged environment for a deal of this magnitude presents some concern for Raymond James analyst Ric Prentiss. He sees an an increased probability of a deal approval to 65% from 55%. But Baird still says the structural remedy of divesting Boost Mobile “may not go far enough for the DoJ, which has stressed the importance of structural remedies vs. behavioral.”

Shares in T-Mobile and Sprint are are down 0.7% and 1.7%, respectively.

Here’s what analysts are saying:

Baird, William Power

“Normally the FCC and DOJ are tightly aligned in telecom mergers, but rumors later in the day suggested that the DOJ may still have reservations to approving the deal,” Power wrote in a morning note. “If that’s correct, we suspect the structural remedy of divesting Boost in the FCC approval may not go far enough for the DOJ, which has stressed the importance of structural remedies vs. behavioral.”

“We’ve had concerns from day one that it could be difficult to prove that reducing the number of competitors is good for consumers.”

“Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s antitrust head, has made it clear that he favors structural remedies over behavioral remedies. Much of the FCC approval appears to be predicated on behavioral remedies, with the primary structural move being the divestiture of Boost Mobile.”

Power says “the stakes couldn’t be any starker” for Masayoshi Son, the CEO and founder of SoftBank, which owns a majority stake in Sprint. “Approval is a homerun and rejection leaves Sprint, and its investment, in a difficult financial and competitive position.”

Buckingham Research, Matthew Harrigan

“The FCC will take weeks to write a formal order but it seems likely that Republican Pai will get his two fellow Republican commissioners to vote in favor and secure a majority.”

Harrigan notes that Pai, the FCC chairman,“incidentally has been very favorably disposed on the criticality of cable small cells in deploying 5G economically.”

“If Washington does still nix the merger it might alternatively heighten talk around other telecom merger activity prompted by controlling Sprint shareholder SoftBank looking for an alternative viability solution.”

“We do not think that Charter, and especially Comcast are at all interested in acquiring a U.S. mobile carrier, with further reinforcement off lackluster 1Q19 results for mobile carriers.”

RBC Capital, Jonathan Atkin

Atkin, after speaking with a telecom legal expert about outcomes, notes that “industry sentiment appears to be that Chairman Pai may have been pressured to accomplish something specifically within mid-band spectrum.”

The firm understands that a court process initiated by either the Justice Department or the state attorneys general could take approximately nine to 12 months in order to resolve.

Atkin says “investor sentiment about the DoJ’s head of antitrust Makan Delrahim is split, with some believing that he will ultimately side with FCC Chairman Pai, while others believe that he will challenge the deal as there is precedent.”

Raymond James, Ric Prentiss

Prentiss anticipates that “it will be many years before the industry is as economically rational as some investors believe this deal signals.”

“We think it is important to note that while the FCC was the first to go public with its official recommendation on the deal, that seems unusual to us and indicates the political nature of the process.”

""We are also cautious on how the deal will be handled in a politically charged environment as we head into the next presidential election and as a result, we are increasing our probability of deal approval from 55% to 65%.""

“We believe the ability to extract new structural solutions from the deal that do not exist under the current competitive framework is very different and could fit the FCC narrative of pushing more rural facilities and broadband.”

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
"As Trade War Hits, China Looks Unsteady as $1.1 Trillion Treasury Investor",https://www.thestreet.com,['Bradley Keoun'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/as-trade-war-hits-china-looks-unsteady-as-trillion-dollar-treasury-bond-investor-14965285,"As President Donald Trump escalates his administration's trade war against China, a growing number of investors worry that the Asian country might fight back by liquidating its biggest-in-the-world stash of U.S. Treasury bonds.

Such a move is seen by most observers as unlikely. For China, it would be the economic version of the nuclear option.

But a new report suggested that China's central bank might have to start selling down its $1.12 trillion of Treasuries anyway -- to meet growing demand for the American currency from Chinese importers and tourists.

China has been one of the biggest buyers of Treasuries since it won entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, so a shift to draw-down mode could reduce global demand for the U.S. government bonds -- putting downward pressure on prices for the securities, and consequently pushing up yields.

It couldn't come at a worse time for the Trump administration, which is confronting China over allegedly unfair trade practices even as the U.S. Treasury Department needs international investors to help finance U.S. government budget deficits, currently pushing $1 trillion a year.

""As China stops being a large buyer of U.S. Treasuries, America's budget deficit is ballooning,"" according to the report from Dubai-based deVere Group, a $12 billion wealth-management firm. ""The combination is negative for U.S. Treasuries.""

Yields on 10-year Treasuries could jump to 2.8% by the end of 2019 from about 2.4% currently, said Tom Elliott, deVere's London-based chief international strategist. And even that level would still be low by historical standards, at roughly half the 30-year average. Last October, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that Treasury yields could jump to 4% or higher.

The Treasury market is critical because it's the U.S. government's primary means of financing the $22 trillion-and-growing national debt. Treasuries are a staple in most investors' portfolios, and they're a core asset of U.S. banks, since the bonds theoretically could be liquidated to free up cash if depositors suddenly demanded their money back.

China's massive trade surplus over the past two decades has allowed the nation to build up roughly $3 trillion of foreign reserves, including the U.S. Treasury bonds.

But that surplus is shrinking now, partly driven by a big increase in the nation's imports from Japan and South Korea as well as a surge in domestic consumption.

More Chinese tourists are going abroad, and they need to exchange their yuan for dollars. As of 2017, for example, the London department store Harrod's was reportedly taking in more sales from Chinese tourists than from British nationals.

A selldown by China of its Treasuries could open a new front in its ongoing trade war with the Trump administration, increasingly seen as a historic standoff among the world's two biggest economic superpowers.

""Some kind of trade conflict was present rather consistently throughout the history of conflict between ruling powers and rising powers,"" according to a Bank of America analysis published Monday.

Higher Treasury yields would likely exacerbate U.S. federal budget deficits, since payments would rise on the national debt.

And given the dollar's role as the world's dominant reserve currency, interest rates would likely also increase in other countries.

""Investors around the world may see higher global borrowing rates, from car loans to mortgages, because of the end of the Chinese savings glut,"" Elliott wrote. ""This could trigger a global economic downturn,"" Elliott wrote."
New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

Two organizations representing farmers and fishermen announced their support for legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture purchase agricultural commodities and seafood from domestically owned enterprises whenever possible.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., introduced this past week a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday called the “Buy American Agriculture Act.”

In addition to requiring the secretary of the USDA to purchase from domestically owned enterprises, the legislation would require the secretary to publish why the purchasing contracts were awarded to enterprises and whether they are domestically owned.

DeLauro announced she would file the bill in January, when the USDA published reports it would purchase nearly 9.8 million pounds of pork for $22.3 million from Greeley-based JBS USA through a program meant to help U.S. farmers impacted by the trade war. However, JBS USA is a subsidiary of JBS SA, an international meatpacker based out of Brazil.

According to reports from the Department of Agriculture, JBS USA has since secured nine additional contracts for nearly 18.5 million pounds of pork for $40.1 million.

“This legislation comes at a time when USDA, in the name of bailing out farmers harmed by the U.S.-China trade war, has already awarded over $60 million of U.S. taxpayer funds to one of the largest and most corrupt meatpacking corporations in the world,” the Organization for Competitive Markets stated in a news release.

In its release, the organization provided the following reasons for supporting the legislation:

In November 2018, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods rescinded its bid for $240,000 through the trade mitigation program after backlash on Capitol Hill,

JBS SA was involved in a corruption scandal involving more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians,

In 2017, the company exported rotten meat worldwide, using cancerous acid products to cover up the stench,

This past year, the company recalled about 12 million pounds of ground beef

The USDA settled claims in 2018 that JBS shorted three separate slaughter facilities on payments for their cattle. The company paid a $50,000 penalty.

“At a time when our farmers and fishermen are barely surviving and multinational companies dominate our food system, this is a particularly important measure,” the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance stated in the release.

JBS USA defended the USDA purchases in a January statement to The Tribune:

“As an approved vendor in USDA food purchasing programs, all eligible JBS USA pork products come from American livestock raised on American farms by U.S. family farmers, and are processed in American facilities in rural American towns.”"

— TOP STORY —

“Feds say no migrants heading to South Florida — for now” via Matt Dixon of POLITICO Florida — After public pushback from Florida’s Republican establishment, the Donald Trump administration now says a plan to send some 1,000 immigrants a month to South Florida is not currently in the works. “We cannot accommodate in Florida this dumping of unlawful migrants into our state. It impacts our resources, the schools, the health care, law enforcement, state agencies,” DeSantis told reporters during a bill signing ceremony. After confusion at both the state and local levels, federal officials now say that there are no near-term plans to send undocumented immigrants from the border to South Florida. “We are not transporting any family units to Florida at this time,” said Stephanie Malin, a spokesperson with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Tweet, tweet:

President @realDonaldTrump and I spoke yesterday and confirmed that he did not approve, nor would approve, sending immigrants who illegally cross the border, to Florida. It is not going to happen. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 19, 2019

“South Florida immigration controversy underscores chaos of Trump’s border policy” via David Smiley and Monique Madan of the Miami Herald — The belated clarity from the Trump administration could at least temporarily quell a tempest that began after the chief of CBP’s Miami office briefed police in Palm Beach and Martin counties on plans to possibly fly families of undocumented immigrants from the southwest border to South Florida. But it’s too late to avoid a controversy that had DeSantis — one of Trump’s most visible allies — criticizing the idea as out of step with actions taken in the state by the president’s own party. The fact that no one knew or trusted information about what was happening for more than a day was largely blamed Friday on Trump’s scattershot immigration policies.

— THE ADMINISTRATION —

“Ron DeSantis signs hotly debated toll-road expansion bill” via Jim Turner of the News Service of Florida — Environmentalists, who were joined by former Governors Charlie Crist and Bob Graham in opposing the plan, said they will continue to wage war against the roads, which they maintain will devastate large rural and natural tracts of land. DeSantis signed the toll-road bill (SB 7068), that will take initial steps to expand the Suncoast Parkway from the Tampa Bay area to the Georgia border; extend Florida’s Turnpike west to connect with the Suncoast Parkway; and add a new multiuse corridor, including a toll road, from Polk County to Collier County. Lawmakers approved spending $45 million next year on the projects, which aren’t expected to be completed for at least a decade.

“Behind the DeSantis flap in Tampa is a real issue: How to spend mental health money for schools” via Marlene Sokol of the Tampa Bay Times — Every one of the 240 public schools in Hillsborough County should be staffed with mental health professionals, School Board member Karen Perez after she tried to make that point during a high-profile verbal joust with DeSantis. The governor interrupted Perez when she brought up the subject during a news conference at Roland Park K-8 School that featured his wife, Casey. He challenged Perez. In an email to the Times, Perez said funding schools should be on a level that allows them to take care of children’s mental health needs in-house, much the way every child in Hillsborough County gets free breakfast and a chance to take part in sports and physical exercise.

— POST-SESSION —

“Lawmakers quietly OK $340 million tax break for big companies” via Gray Rohrer of the Orlando Sentinel — HB 7127 has received none of the fanfare that accompanied a separate measure containing $121 million in tax cuts, mostly for shoppers during sales tax holidays for hurricane preparedness supplies and back-to-school items. The bill is a complicated measure related to the tax cut law passed by Congress and signed by Trump. Last year, Florida lawmakers reacted by capping the amount of corporate income tax the state would receive and offering rebates to businesses for any overages. In the bill, which was lobbied for this year by large business lobbies such as the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Retail Federation, they extended that rebate and rate reduction two more years, through 2021.

“Janet Cruz, Darryl Rouson defend controversial toll road votes” via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics — Sens. Rouson and Cruz both voted in favor of a bill (SB 7068) that serves as a launch point for three new tolled highways. Environmental groups statewide opposed the bill claiming it was bad for natural habitats and unnecessary to alleviate traffic congestion. “At the time that I voted for the bill that seemed reasonable,” Cruz said during a Tampa Tiger Bay luncheon recapping the Florida Legislative Session. Cruz said her support was merely to study and evaluate the usefulness of the proposed project. Rouson agreed with Cruz’s concerns about emergency evacuations. But Rouson also reminded opponents of the project that this year’s bill does not make it a done deal.

“Florida drags feet for decades on fire safety for condos” via Steve Bousquet of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — It’s whether high-rise condos should have required retrofitting with sprinkler systems in case of fire. To fire safety experts, this is a matter of life and death. To condo unit owners, it’s a matter of money, and they vote. Condo buildings taller than 75 feet must have sprinkler systems or, as an alternative, emergency life safety systems to meet a Jan. 1, 2020, deadline. Condo owners can vote to opt out of sprinklers by majority vote, but the deadline remains controversial and could be expensive. Cost estimates of sprinklers vary wildly, from $1,500 to $20,000 per condo unit. When it comes to all talk and no action in the Legislature, no other issue comes close.

— GILLUM HITS BACK —

After delivering a $100,000 check to the Democratic Party for recruitment, former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum sat down with the Tampa Bay Times to talk a wide range of topics, where the focus turned to a possible 2020 Democratic nominee.

— Gillum responded to criticism from Orlando attorney John Morgan about sitting on campaign money instead of spending it on his 2018 race — with a suggestion that he use it for the restitution of felons so they can vote.

— He said: “We have already stated our intention here and that is with every dollar that I have and every dollar that we raise, every resource we get access to, it is going toward the effort of registering and reengaging one million voters. I don’t think there’s a more important task between now and the election than organizing Democrats around the state and recruiting and registering more Democrats in the state.”

— “Why should the people of the state of Florida, why should the amendment folks who worked on that amendment be the ones now financially responsible for now solving a problem that didn’t exist but for the Florida Legislature creating it?” Gillum asked.

— The former Mayor also touched on ongoing FBI investigation into corruption in Tallahassee, which put Gillum’s ethics into question: “I’m not waiting for any shoes to drop … it breaks my heart to see our community not being valued for all the great things it has or had going on.”

— As for the presidential race, Gillum did not immediately dismiss “electing older white men,” mainly after Joe Biden gave his gubernatorial campaign a big boost toward the end of the campaign: “I do not believe that we should discriminate a candidate simply because they’re a white male or because they are a woman or because they are young.”

— STATEWIDE —

“Did a nonresponse to hacking questions give this Florida elections office away?” via David Smiley of the Miami Herald — This week, in response to hacking questions sent to every supervisor of elections in the state, two offices issued the same legalistic non-denial. Almost word-for-word, they gave the same reaction when asked if their voter registration networks were hacked in 2016, explaining that they could not answer questions because to do so could “directly or indirectly” help determine the answer — deemed classified by the FBI. It now turns out that at least one of those two offices was, in fact, hacked … hackers gained access in 2016 to the voter registration database in Washington County, a Panhandle jurisdiction of about 16,000 registered voters. But the identity of the second hacked supervisors’ office remains a mystery.

“Thousands of Florida children have no health insurance. A new infusion of money aims to help.” via Justine Griffin of the Tampa Bay Times — Thousands of children in Florida will have greater access to health care now that legislators have steered more money to a program that reduces the cost of health insurance plans for low- and middle-income families. Uninsured children, at last count, have grown to an estimated 325,000 in Florida. The funding will go to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a public-private organization that offers health insurance to children up to 18 whose families earn too much income to qualify for Medicaid. The newly approved funding will restore the less expensive coverage for families who rely on the full-pay plan. For this initial round, the federal government will contribute $5.8 million to the program, and the state will add $1.1 million.

“Nationally, number of people hurt in firearms accidents is flat. In Florida, it’s soaring.” via Tony Marrero of the Tampa Bay Times — The number of people injured by accidental gunfire each year is rising in Florida, with 857 injuries in 2017, state data show. What’s more, with about 22 people a year killed in Florida, the state is bucking a nationwide trend toward a decline in accidental gunfire deaths. One trend is clear: The number of Floridians injured by accidental gunfire has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2007, 471 Floridians went to the hospital with nonfatal accidental gunshot injuries, the Florida Department of Health data shows. By 2017, the most recent year available, the number had climbed to 857, an 82 percent increase. In the same period, the number of Floridians with a concealed carry permit quadrupled to nearly 1.8 million.

What Emmett Reed is reading — Neglected: Many of Florida’s best nursing homes lose under new funding plan” via Ryan Mills of the Naples Daily News — Sixty-five of the state’s highest-rated nursing homes are expected to take a financial hit under the new system, which was implemented late last year, an analysis of nursing home payment rates found. At the same time, more than 50 of Florida’s lowest-rated nursing homes — many belonging to Consulate Health Care, the state’s largest chain — are poised to rake in millions of additional Medicaid dollars under the new plan. Over the past year, an investigation has shown that more than 50 of Florida’s worst-performing nursing homes continue operating without fear of serious consequence, even after patients have died due to neglect or mistreatment

“’A poke in the eye’: Trump tariffs threatened Florida trade deal with China” via Shawm Mulcahy of WFSU — U.S.-levied tariffs have led China to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods. That’s taken a toll on domestic industries, particularly farmers. They could derail a trade deal with China that’s been years in the making. In 2012, the Florida Agriculture Department started talks with China to export blueberries. After seven years of negotiations, the compulsory visit by China’s General Administration of Quality Supervisors, Inspection, and Quarantine finally occurred last month. The Chinese delegation, accompanied by members of the state Agriculture Department’s Division of Plant Industries and representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, toured blueberry farms in Gainesville and Orlando. Shortly after, Trump imposed a new round of tariffs. And these new tariffs, officials say, could jeopardize the deal.

“Florida advocates praise ‘historic’ equality act vote in Congress” via Kare Santich of the Orlando Sentinel — The sweeping legislation, passed on a 236-173 vote along mostly party lines, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure equal access to housing, employment, education, federal programs, jury service, public accommodations and credit and lending regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart was one of eight Republicans to vote in favor of the legislation — even as he criticized it. “I cannot oppose a bill that seeks to prevent discrimination,” he said following the vote. Diaz-Balart said the bill should have included language that also provided protections to individuals, medical professionals and religious organizations that base actions on “deeply held religious beliefs.”

“Michael Flynn contacted Matt Gaetz while cooperating with special counsel” via Pamela Brown, Jeremy Herb, Katelyn Polantz and Kaitlan Collins of CNN — Flynn sent Twitter direct messages to Rep. Matt Gaetz, encouraging the Florida Republican to “keep the pressure on.” It’s not clear if Flynn sent additional messages to other lawmakers. “You stay on top of what you’re doing. Your leadership is so vital for our country now. Keep the pressure on,” Flynn wrote in an April 2018 message to Gaetz. On the evening Flynn sent the message to Gaetz, the lawmaker had appeared on Fox Business’ “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” where he criticized the Mueller investigation. “We’ve got to play a far stronger role in exposing the hypocrisy at the Department of Justice,” Gaetz said in the April 3, 2018, appearance.

“DCCC hammers Ross Spano over clarification he did not raise $1 in ‘grassroots’ contributions” via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics — The DCCC chastised Spano’s 2020 campaign for defending its lack of grassroots support with a comment that appears to make that support look even grimmer. At issue are reports of Spano’s first quarter campaign earnings that found the Congressman had raised just $1 “from the grassroots.” An analysis of campaign contributions found only one donation to his campaign less than $200, and that was for just $1. His first-quarter earnings totaled nearly $100,000. But the Spano campaign later clarified, that wasn’t actually a contribution. “The $1 donation was a test to ensure our systems were working post-swearing in,” Spano campaign spokeswoman Sandi Poreda told Roll Call. “Obviously, grassroots support is a critical component to a successful campaign.”

“DCCC ad touts Debbie Mucarsel-Powell vote on prescription drugs” via Ryan Nicol of Florida Politics — A day after Mucarsel-Powell joined House Democrats in approving a bill aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is out with a new digital ad promoting the freshman congresswoman’s vote. “DID YOU HEAR?!,” the ad exclaims. “Rep. Mucarsel-Powell just voted to lower costs for health care and prescription drugs — and the bill PASSED! These heroic efforts to expand access to health care prove she’s fighting for our community. Yet another promise kept!” While it’s true the House passed the measure, the bill is far from full passage.

“Brian Mast, Darren Soto to push bill for VA hospital congressional offices” via Scott Powers of Florida Politics — Mast, of Palm City, and Soto, of Kissimmee have called a news conference in Kissimmee Monday to unveil their proposed legislation, which they say will help eliminate roadblocks to such offices. Currently, they are the only two members of Florida’s delegation in Congress with such offices. The “Improving Veterans Access to Congressional Services Act,” which they intend to introduce, would require the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to permit the use of VA hospitals’ facilities by members of Congress to meet with constituents and resolve veteran-related issues. It also would establish standard operating procedures for the opening of new congressional offices in VA hospitals.

“Noah Pransky’s zombie campaign of the week — Mike Haridopolos” via Florida Politics — Haridopolos‘ 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate never even made it to 2012, but eight years after pulling out of the primary, he continues to benefit from the campaign cash he raked in for that run at federal office. It appears his lobbying clients are also benefiting from the cash. Haridopolos hauled in $3.5 million in 2011 for his federal run, all while holding the gavel as Florida Senate President. The money poured in, by the hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, most of the millions went unspent after Haridopolos dropped out of the race. The use of “zombie campaign” funds to supplement the private lives of legislators-turned-lobbyists, like Haridopolos, remains mostly unchecked by the FEC.

“At rally, Joe Biden pledges to unite the country: ‘We’re all in this together’” via Annie Linskey of The Washington Post — Biden offered himself to voters as a leader uniquely positioned to unify a divided country during a rally Saturday afternoon. “We’re all in this together,” Biden told the crowd. “We need to remember that today, I think, more than any time in my career.” He added a note of optimism: “In this great experiment of equality and opportunity and decency, we haven’t lived up — but we’ve never given up on it.” Biden took repeated and direct aim at Trump, comparing his tactics to those used by dictators. At one point, he quoted Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, delivered during the Civil War on a Pennsylvania battlefield, to drive home the importance of uniting the country.

Those rules are actually very inclusive, so much so that the DNC may have to narrow them again before the first debate. The DNC decided to cut off the number of candidates who can qualify for a debate at 20. It could be close. Who’s missing the debate stage as of now — Michael F. Bennet, Bill de Blasio, Steve Bullock, Wayne Messam and Seth Moulton. Who’s in but right on the bubble — John Delaney, Kristin Gillibrand, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Tim Ryan, Eric Swalwell and Marianne Williamson.

First in Sunburn — “Senate Democrats announce summer fundraising schedule” via Florida Politics — Senate Democratic Leader Audrey Gibson and Leader Designate Gary Farmer unveiled five high-dollar fundraising events benefiting the Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the primary fundraising arm for Democratic state Senate campaigns. The first in the series, “The Bimini Bash,” will be held June 3-5 in Alice Town, Bahamas. After an empty July slate, the second funder will be held August 24 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, where donors can watch the Gators and Canes face off alongside the Senate Democrats. Another out-of-state sojourn follows in September when the blue team plans to be in the Bluegrass State for a trip down the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. The penultimate event is Oct. 15, when lawmakers are in Tallahassee for the second of six planned interim committee weeks leading into the 2020 Legislative Session. The Caucus Reception will be held at Proof Brewing Co. Finally, Senate Democrats will head to Universal Studios Orlando for a “Family Weekend” Nov. 8-10.

“Debra Kaplan files for rematch with Jennifer Sullivan in HD 31” via Scott Powers of Florida Politics — Sullivan defeated Kaplan 61-39 in November in the Republican-rich district covering northeast Lake County and northwest Orange County. Kaplan, 66, a retired journalist and part-time aide to a criminal defense lawyer, views the landscape as having changed. Kaplan, of Eustis, says she now has considerable name recognition from the start and an angry constituency vowing to provide her with campaign cash. And she noted that Sullivan, of Mount Dora, became a leader in many of the Republicans’ more controversial efforts this past Legislative Session, as chair of the House Education Committee. “I can’t allow her to stay another two years,” Kaplan said. “She’s done enough damage.”

“Second Republican files to challenge Adam Hattersley in HD 59” via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics — Michael Owen, a Tampa Bay-area attorney, filed for this week. But Owen doesn’t live in the district. According to Hillsborough County Property Appraiser records, Owen owns a home in South Tampa where he claims a homestead exemption. Owen purchased a townhome just outside of MacDill Air Force Base last April. Records also show he bought a home in Valrico in 2017. Under Florida law, candidates can run for state House seats in districts where they do not live as long as they move to the region if elected. Owens said residency wouldn’t be an issue. “I sure hope this becomes an issue of roots to Brandon,” Owen said. “You’re not going to find deeper roots in this community than with me.”

Special elections voter registration deadline — Today is the voter registration deadline in special elections for House District 7 and House District 38. Port St. Joe Republican Jason Shoaf and Tallahassee Democrat Ryan Terrell face off in the June 18 special election in HD 7, vacated by former Rep. Halsey Beshears to become secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Dade City Republican Randy Maggard and Wesley Chapel Democrat Kelly Smith are running in HD 38, which former Rep. Danny Burgess left to become executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

“Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, will run for Miami-Dade County Commission” via Martin Vassolo of the Miami Herald — She has appeared on network TV, co-written a book and helped form a nonprofit organization — the Trayvon Martin Foundation — named in her son’s memory and based in his hometown of Miami Gardens. Now she’s challenging the city’s Mayor for a seat on the Miami-Dade County Commission. “Since 2012, I have advocated tirelessly to empower our communities and make them safer,” Fulton said in a statement: “The work is not done.” The District 1 seat will be relinquished in 2020 by the term-limited Commissioner Barbara Jordan. Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert is also running for the seat. Miami Gardens is the biggest city in District 1.

“Lawsuit: Town of Palm Beach accused of collusion, playing favorites in disputes between its residents” via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics — What seemed like a neighborly dispute between John and Margaret Thornton and their neighbor, Lamia Jacobs, now looks more like a case of corruption and influence-peddling in a town full of highly influential residents. After numerous disputes ranging from illegally built tennis courts to a ban on landscapers parking on a privately-owned road, Jacobs scored just one win. The Thornton family, meanwhile, have been able to get their way in nearly every other bout, many times with the help of not-so-impartial city officials — a handful of key elected officials and Town staff are firmly in the Thornton corner. Jacobs filed an equal protection lawsuit against the Town of Palm Beach in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

“’Bungled from the beginning’: How Robert Kraft’s sex sting was marred by cops’ missteps” via Marc Freeman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — What began as authorities’ mission to bust criminal activity in massage parlors across Florida has turned into a monumental legal victory for Kraft and others charged with soliciting prostitution. The defendants had won rulings in their favor, including a watershed moment this past week when the judge in the Kraft case prohibited prosecutors from using secretly recorded sex videos. “This case has been bungled from the beginning, in every way,” said Joseph Tacopina, a former New York City prosecutor who recently filed a federal class-action lawsuit claiming cops violated constitutional privacy rights by using covert cameras in a Jupiter spa.

“’Silent strike’: Demoralized and underpaid, 625 teachers have walked away from Brevard schools” via Carolyn Glenn of FLORIDA TODAY — Over the last three years alone, a total of 625 teachers have resigned from Brevard, according to the district’s human resources department. Some have left for private schools and charter schools, some for other counties and some for private industries. Looking at the numbers, Brevard School Board Chair Tina Descovich said the district isn’t “in a crisis yet,” but needs to find ways to convince teachers to stay. The Brevard Federation of Teachers sees an exodus that it says represents a “silent strike” seizing Brevard Public Schools. Silent because in Florida teacher strikes are illegal. So instead of walking off the job in protest, some teachers are walking away from it altogether.

“Lakeland commissioners to weigh charter changes for November’s ballot” via Sara-Megan Walsh of the Lakeland Ledger — For more than two years, commissioners have held off holding a public vote on six recommendations made by the Charter Review Committee in May 2017. Tim McCausland, Lakeland’s city attorney, said they must address the lingering issue at the May 20 policy committee meeting. “They made the decision to defer till November 2019,” he said. “The time is here.” McCausland said he would present the commission with detailed information on the proposed political changes and what needs to be done to move forward. “I will lay out the timeline with what I see as the critical dates,” he said. “Then probably ask them if there would be any additional things beyond the recommendations of the Charter Review Committee.”

“Amazon wants to build cargo air hub at Lakeland airport, will create 800+ jobs” via Veronica Brezina-Smith of the Tampa Bay Business Journal — Amazon.com Services Inc. wants to enter a ground lease with Lakeland Linder International Airport for air cargo operations. The ground lease is for Amazon to initially lease 47 acres of a 110-acre parcel in the northwest sector to support its operations. Amazon would be able to expand from the original site into the adjoining 62 acres of property within the first five years of the ground lease at the prevailing lease rates. The lease value would be just under $1 million a year for the first five years and would increase to over $1 million for the next five. The e-commerce giant intends to construct a 223,000-square-foot building along with two accessory buildings of up to 60,000 square feet combined.

“Sarasota 9/11 connection remains cloaked in government secrecy, breeding suspicion of Saudi role in terror attacks” via Bob Graham for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel — Irish author Anthony Summers stumbled onto the relationship between the pilots and the al-Hijji family while in Sarasota researching a book on 9/11 titled “The Eleventh Day.” He joined forces with Dan Christensen, founder of the online Florida Bulldog. Together, Christensen and Summers confirmed and published news reports revealing that the FBI had conducted an extensive investigation of the Saudi family’s flight from Sarasota. The FBI reacted the next day, admitting it had investigated the family but also vehemently claiming it had found “no connection” between the family and the hijackers. In response to a Freedom of Information Act suit, the FBI initially claimed it could not find a single record of its Sarasota investigation.

“Using migrants as pawns, Trump poses a challenge to our humanity” via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel editorial board — The plan his administration floated posed a challenge to our humanity — from a man who has none. Ten days ago, at a campaign rally in the Florida Panhandle, he asked, “But how do you stop these people?” Someone in the audience shouted out, “Just shoot them.” The crowd laughed. Did the President of the United States rebuke the callous remark? No. He smiled and made light of it. “Only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,” he said. The President is not shooting people. But he’s willing and eager to use desperate men, women and children as political pawns. Why did his Border Patrol propose moving migrants to Broward? Why Palm Beach? Why not, say, the Panhandle?

“Joe Henderson: On balance, DeSantis has been positive for environment” via Florida Politics — Protectors of Florida’s environment feel duped by DeSantis after he approved three major toll road projects. I don’t agree this time. People aren’t going to stop moving here. The state has to plan for that, and that means creating more ways to get around. All those newcomers can’t just cram into Miami-Dade, Orlando, and Tampa. Environmentalists bemoan the sprawl. They have a point. But it would be better if things could spread out a bit rather than concentrate in areas already oversaturated with people. And if a hurricane like we saw last year with Michael plowed up the middle of the state, having more evacuation routes could save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.

“Micah Kubic: Floridians’ civil rights, civil liberties would be better off if Session ended earlier” via Florida Politics — Floridians’ civil rights and civil liberties would be better off if the Session had ended weeks earlier. In just 61 days, the Florida Legislature managed the monumental feat of unraveling and undermining decades of progress. This year’s Session was characterized by unrelenting and cynical attacks on the values we share. The most egregious example came when the Legislature dramatically restricted Amendment 4, the landmark constitutional amendment approved by voters just last year. No legislative action was necessary at all. The amendment was self-executing and, for five months, it has been. Denying returning citizens the ballot because they owe money creates a two-tiered democracy, and that is wrong.

“Florida lawmakers keep putting limits on public access to public information. Ask them: Why?” via the Miami Herald editorial board — Florida lawmakers made a lot of bad calls in the 2019 session: They erected hurdles to ex-felons voting; by arming teachers they made schools more dangerous, not less; and they staged their annual irresponsible raid on affordable-housing funds. They didn’t stop there. State legislators, in another unfortunate annual tradition, further reduced the government information that is available to the public. Too often, lawmakers’ efforts to block public access to public information were driven by political wiliness, the push for bureaucratic secrecy or flat-out animus toward the media. None of these reasons is in Floridians’ best interests. Floridians should push back against lawmakers’ disdain for them and their right to know.

“Heffley & Associates lobbying pay spiked in Q1” via Drew Wilson of Florida Politics — The lobbying duo of Richard Heffley and Kelly Horton saw substantial earnings growth in the first three months of the year. New reports show Heffley & Associates earned as much as $760,000 in pay from their 30 clients in the first quarter. Florida lobbyists report their earnings in ranges covering $10,000 increments. If all Heffley & Associates’ contracts hit the median number in those ranges, the firm would have earned $485,000. That median estimate is nearly $100,000 higher than what Heffley and Horton hauled during the same quarter last year. The max estimate beats out their Q1 2018 ceiling by an even bigger margin. The difference maker: Heffley & Associates has eight more clients than it did a year ago.

“UCF AD Danny White on USF’s 2-for-1s against Gators, ‘Canes: ‘Precedent I don’t like being set’” via Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel — Every time we hear coaches and administrators in the American Athletic Conference parrot the company line and call themselves a “Power 6” league, it’s difficult to control the urge to shake your head, roll your eyes and bust out laughing. Case in point: USF’s football-scheduling announcement earlier this week in which the Bulls revealed they would be playing a future two-for-one series against Miami. This comes in the wake of an earlier announcement in which the Bulls agreed to play a future two-for-one against Florida. What this means is the Gators and the Hurricanes will get two revenue-producing home games while USF gets only one home game. If this is USF’s scheduling philosophy, then so be it; to each his own.

“Redemption for Ocala-based trainer” via Carlos Medina of the Ocala Star-Banner — War of Will wins Preakness Stakes for Ocala-based trainer Mark Casse, making up for a wild Kentucky Derby finish two weeks ago. This time, Casse didn’t have to wonder what could have been after War of Will won the 144th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. The first Triple Crown win for Casse came after a wild Kentucky Derby where War of Will, moving forward toward the lead, got cut off by a drifting Maximum Security forcing jockey Tyler Gaffalione to pull the horse up, eventually finishing seventh. Maximum Security crossed the wire first, but stewards disqualified him for the swerving trip and installed Country House as the winner. After Saturday’s race, Casse was still trying to process the win.

Fox Business' Dagen McDowell believes they are, and said that is why some Democrats are questioning Barr's motives.

""They are trying to discredit him because they are worried, people who worked in the Obama administration, in the FBI and in the CIA and the intelligence community, they are worried. Whether it's Brennan or Comey or even subordinates of both of them. They are worried about what Bill Barr and John Durham and the Inspector General Michael Horowitz are going to find,"" McDowell said while co-hosting ""The Five.""

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."

Rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran are also magnifying strains among President Donald Trump’s top foreign policy advisers: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton.

Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against the mullahs in Tehran has exacerbated fissures between the two men over the tight control Bolton has tried to exert over the national security decision-making process — and introduced new ones over the direction of U.S. policy.

Story Continued Below

Pompeo and his special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, have indicated that the administration’s goal in squeezing Iran is renewed negotiations with Iranian regime, according to two sources familiar with their thinking — something Trump has expressed a desire to do. But Bolton is a deep skeptic of the value of negotiating with adversaries who, before joining the White House, called publicly for regime change in Tehran.

While Pompeo has worked to carry out the president’s foreign policy directives, Bolton has done more to try to shape them — at times contradicting the president, as when he walked back Trump’s call for a rapid U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.

Pompeo, 55, is widely seen as a loyalist to the president who rarely challenges Trump’s views. Some administration officials believe the former Kansas congressman, who recently flirted with a run for U.S. Senate, is exceedingly mindful of his own political future.

Bolton by contrast is capping a decades-long government career during which he has never hesitated to offer unpopular opinions — and is conscious that, at the age of 70, the position he holds as national security adviser is likely to be his last government post.

“Pompeo has demonstrated himself to be somebody who very much sees his job as realizing Trump’s vision for foreign policy, whatever that may be,” said David Rothkopf, a business consultant who has written books on the making of U.S. foreign policy.

In the case of Iran, U.S. officials say, their divergent approaches to working with the impulsive president has strained their relationship as the U.S. rattles a military saber at Tehran and the Iranians threaten to violate the 2015 nuclear deal struck with the Obama administration and five other nations.

Though Bolton and Pompeo largely have the same hawkish instincts, when disagreements have arisen, Bolton has made clear why he has a reputation as bare-knuckled bureaucratic infighter. He has placed the interagency national security process in a tight grip, aggressively shaping policy rather than acting as an impartial arbiter as many of his predecessors have done.

His predecessor, H.R. McMaster, was widely praised for the way he ran in the interagency process. Some officials, including Pompeo and former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, even complained that McMaster hosted too many meetings. On Bolton’s watch, those practices have gone by the wayside. The twice weekly 7:30 a.m. phone calls McMaster hosted to coordinate plans amongst senior national security officials stopped the day Bolton arrived at the White House.

A more informal process has since taken root, including a weekly breakfast attended by Bolton, Pompeo, and acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan.

One result is more centralized decision-making, which can leave Pompeo feeling excluded from a decision-making process he must later defend.

“Bolton is not very collaborative, he likes to do stuff himself. Pompeo is more collaborative by nature. And even if he weren’t inclined to be collaborative, he feels that he should be collaborated with because he’s the secretary of State,” said a former administration official who remains close to Pompeo.

Pompeo has specifically expressed irritation at Bolton’s use of Twitter to announce U.S. policy moves about which he has at times not been consulted about, said a senior administration official.

Bolton’s frequent tweeting is just one of several ways in which he has adopted an unusually visible profile more befitting a diplomat. While many national security advisers travel infrequently, he has made numerous foreign trips, including to Israel, Russia, Turkey, and Latin America.

Trump denied this week that there is “infighting” within his national security team. But days after Bolton released a strikingly bellicose May 5 statement threatening Iran with “unrelenting force,” Trump told reporters last week that he sometimes has to “temper” his senior aide’s “strong views.”

That same day, Pompeo issued a statement of his own that also threatened force, but ended on a markedly different note, citing Trump’s previous call for the Iranians to negotiate.

“As President Trump stated yesterday,” Pompeo wrote, “he ‘looks forward to someday meeting with leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves.’”

Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for Bolton, said that Bolton had not authored the hawkish May 5 statement released under his name. “The Department of Defense wrote the statement and asked that it be released from the White House.” Marquis said.

Allies of both men dismissed any disagreements between the two as the vanity of small differences.

“I think this is a debate between two Iran hawks that’s taking place between the 40-yard lines,” said Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who is close to senior Trump officials. “Any differences they have are tactical over the appropriate sequencing of maximum pressure measures and coercive diplomacy.”

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador Bolton and fully aligned on Iran policy,” said a State Department spokesman.

Further exacerbating the tension is a quiet campaign waged by Bolton’s team against Hook, Pompeo’s point man on Iran. Hook, backed by Pompeo, had sought to extend waivers granted by the Trump administration to eight countries allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran despite U.S. sanctions. That effort included outreach to friendly reporters with whispers that Hook was going weak on Iran and had landed on the wrong side of the debate — intended to shape the internal battle, in which Bolton ultimately prevailed. The State Department announced in early May that it would not grant additional waivers.

“At the president’s direction, Ambassador Bolton worked closely with departments and agencies to ensure the U.S. government brought Iran’s oil exports to zero,” said National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis.

Bolton and his allies say that he has not elbowed out his colleagues but reshaped the national security process to reflect Trump’s personal style. Bolton’s critics complain that he has largely phased out “principals committee” meetings, the forum for top Cabinet members to prepare and discuss policy options before presenting them to the president.

And he has also convened fewer formal in-depth meetings of the formal National Security Council with the president and more 15-minute Oval Office sessions where Bolton pulls in experts and advisers as he sees fit.

“You’ve got a national security adviser who doesn’t really want to have a process, he just wants to be the president’s chief adviser,” Rothkopf said.

That has frustrated Pompeo, who has joked about starting his own interagency, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the remark.

“The power of the national security adviser comes at the principals level, and the national security adviser controls access to the president,” said a senior administration official. “If you have lower-level meetings but very few Principals Committee meetings, then the final level is owned by the national security adviser.”"
