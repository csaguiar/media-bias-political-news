Megan Rapinoe's message to Trump: 'Your message is excluding people',https://www.cnn.com,['Caroline Kelly'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/megan-rapinoe-anderson-cooper-trump-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) US women's soccer captain Megan Rapinoe sent a message to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, telling him he's excluding groups of Americans with his message and that he needs to do better in caring for every single American.

When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper what she would say to Trump, Rapinoe looked into the camera and said, ""Your message is excluding people. You're excluding me, you're excluding people that look like me, you're excluding people of color, you're excluding Americans that maybe support you.""

The back-to-back World Cup champion added that ""we need to have a reckoning"" with the implications of Trump's Make America Great Again slogan, because ""you're harking back to an era that was not great for everyone -- it might have been great for a few people, and maybe America is great for a few people right now, but it's not great for enough Americans in this world,"" she said, still directing her message to the President.

""You have an incredible responsibility as the chief of this country to take care of every single person, and you need to do better for everyone,"" Rapinoe added.

Rapinoe has skyrocketed to national prominence for leading her team's undefeated run to win the World Cup on Sunday, championing the lawsuit filed by 28 US Women's National Team players demanding pay equal to the men's team -- and asserting that she would not be ""going to the f*****g White House"" if the women's team won the World Cup. Her comments were made in January but became public only last month.

"AOC sued over blocking Twitter users, following appeals court ruling on Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Dov Hikind', 'On Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-to-face-lawsuit-over-blocking-twitter-users-following-appeals-court-ruling-on-trump,"Former Democratic New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind filed a lawsuit against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. in federal court on Tuesday for blocking users on Twitter based on their personal viewpoints, following a federal appeals court ruling earlier in the day barring President Trump from doing the same.

""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has blocked me on Twitter yesterday apparently because my critique of her tweets and policies have been too stinging,"" Hikind said in a statement announcing the suit, which was filed in the Eastern District of New York and obtained by Fox News.

""Just today the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a ruling that elected officials cannot block individuals from their Twitter accounts, thereby setting a precedent that Ocasio-Cortez must follow,"" he added. ""Twitter is a public space, and all should have access to the government officials on it.""

The First Amendment prohibits discrimination by government actors against a person’s free speech based on his or her viewpoints.

Hikind continued: ""It's unclear if Ocasio-Cortez is aware of this ruling or not, but either way, I have decided, after speaking with my legal counsel, to initiate a lawsuit against her for blocking me and a host of other public figures. Ocasio-Cortez is acting cowardly and should be ashamed of her attempts to silence me. I’ve done nothing but address her ignorance and disregard for the truth. She constantly brags about the millions of followers she has but is afraid of my speech. She is a hypocrite.

""She is a hypocrite."" — Dov Hikind, on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

""I'm looking forward to the day where she has to unblock me so that free speech in America is guaranteed even when it offends!"" he concluded.

The complaint seeks an injunction against Ocasio-Cortez, a declaration that she violated the First Amendment, and an award of attorney's fees. The complaint focuses on Ocasio-Cortez's popular and active @AOC account, with more than 4.6 million followers.

Ocasio-Cortez has maintained a much smaller and rarely used official account, @RepAOC, with only 171,000 followers, but has used her personal @AOC account to discuss politics and engage with constituents and colleagues regularly.

OCASIO-CORTEZ USES PELOSI'S OWN WORDS AGAINST HER AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF INSULTING SPEAKER

For example, the top post pinned to Ocasio-Cortez's @AOC feed on Tuesday stated, ""A #GreenNewDeal is our plan for a world and a future worth fighting for."" On July 5, she wrote to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, ""Thank you, @SenSanders. It’s an honor to work alongside you and the millions of other people fighting for education, healthcare, and a living wage as rights.""

Hikind, speaking to Fox News, added that in addition to himself, “several others, including journalists"" have been blocked entirely from viewing or interacting with Ocasio-Cortez's tweets. (Twitter also permits Ocasio-Cortez to ""mute"" users so that she cannot see their responses, without blocking them from viewing her tweets entirely -- a middle-ground option U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald had suggested to Trump.)

The Daily Caller said Ocasio-Cortez blocked the site in May after it contradicted her claims on the Green New Deal rollout. Additionally, OANN's Liz Wheeler tweeted on July 5 that Ocasio-Cortez had blocked her, even though she was ""respectful & civil.""

After this article was first published, journalist Harry Cherry told Fox News he was blocked after calling Ocasio-Cortez a ""moron"" following her remarks comparing border facilities to concentration camps.

And, The Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra wrote on April 5 that Ocasio-Cortez ""finally blocked me and it was after I called out her latest set of lies.""

Saavedra said he was blocked after writing on Twitter about a viral video of Ocasio-Cortez seemingly using an unusual manner of speech.

""Ocasio-Cortez speaks in an accent that she never uses while telling a room of predominately black people that there is nothing wrong with them folding clothes, cooking, and driving other people around on a bus for a living,"" Saavedra wrote.

Ocasio-Cortez responded that those ""talking about [her] voice can step right off"" and claimed she used a similar manner of speech when discussing Brett Kavanaugh and talking at the Women's March. Saavedra reportedly was blocked after finding and posting videos of those speeches that he said contradicted Ocasio-Cortez's claims.

Hikind's complaint mentions Wheeler, Cherry and Saavedra, as well as the student origination “Students for Trump.""

Earlier in the day, Hikind said he was seeking others to come forward.

""If you or anyone you know has been blocked by @AOC please get in touch with me ASAP!"" Hikind tweeted Tuesday, suggesting he may have wanted to speak to other potential co-plaintiffs or gather additional evidence.

Also on July 9, YouTube star and NY-11 Republican Congressional candidate Joey ""Salads"" Saladino announced that he, too, was planning to Ocasio-Cortez following the appellate ruling, saying she blocked him shortly after he announced his candidacy in May.

""I'm suing AOC because we need to be able to have a strong and vigorous debate between the parties, otherwise our fragile system of ideas and representation breaks down,"" Saladino said in a statement. ""Though she is not in a position of power, she is the voice of her generation of Democrat voters, and bigger than some of the Presidential candidates.""

A Saladino spokesperson claimed in an email to Fox News that Ocasio-Cortez's decision to block Saladino was ""unprovoked,"" and condemned ""digital feudalism, which those on the left seem enthusiastic about - completely antithetical to the American Nation.""

Saladino has been called a racist because of some of his videos and pranks depicting African-Americans. In one video, he remarked, ""the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters."" (The video appeared to depict black individuals vandalizing a car with pro-Trump stickers, and later emerged to be a fake orchestrated by Saladino.)

In its decision, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals noted that because Trump has used Twitter to communicate with the public about his administration, and because his account has been open to the public for people to comment on his posts, it warranted constitutional free speech protection under the First Amendment.

The appellate ruling specifically affirmed a lower court’s decision that declared the president’s account a “public forum"" for First Amendment purposes.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHECKING OUT TWITTER ALTERNATIVE AMID CENSORSHIP FEARS

“We do conclude,"" Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote for the majority, ""...that the First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise‐open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees.""

Parker added: ""This debate, as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be, is nonetheless a good thing. In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less.""

The court rejected Trump's argument that he was using his Twitter account, which has more than 60 million followers and routinely discusses matters of policy, in a personal capacity.

""We conclude that the evidence of the official nature of the account is overwhelming,"" Parker said. ""We also conclude that once the president has chosen a platform and opened up its interactive space to millions of users and participants, he may not selectively exclude those whose views he disagrees with.""

According to court documents, Trump admitted he blocked the case plaintiffs in 2017 after they posted tweets that ""criticized him or his policies."" Once they were blocked, they were no longer able to view Trump’s tweets while logged in, nor were they able to reply to tweets or view comment threads on Trump’s Twitter page.

The court said Trump’s account indeed was private before he became president, but that changed once he took office and used it for official business, as it has displayed “all the trappings of an official, state‐run account"" since. The court said once Trump leaves office, his account would be considered private again.

LINDA SARSOUR GETS BACKLASH FOR 'JESUS WAS PALESTINIAN' TWEET

The Justice Department, meanwhile, stood by Trump's position and indicated an appeal may be forthcoming.

""We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are exploring possible next steps,"" DOJ spokesperson Kelly Laco said in a statement. ""As we argued, President Trump’s decision to block users from his personal twitter account does not violate the First Amendment.”

The opinion concluded by pointing out that in the current political climate, more debate has been good, even if it's ""unpleasant"" at times.

""The irony in all of this is that we write at a time in the history of this nation when the conduct of our government and its officials is subject to wide‐open, robust debate,"" the court said.

""This debate encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of ideas and viewpoints and generates a level of passion and intensity the likes of which have rarely been seen. This debate, as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be, is nonetheless a good thing. In resolving this appeal, we remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less.""

That debate soon may have to extend to members of Congress. Late Tuesday, Hikind tweeted simply, ""See you in court @AOC.""

Strip club to host golf tournament at Trump resort in South Florida,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['David A. Fahrenthold', 'Reporter Covering The Trump Family', 'Its Business Interests.', 'July At Pm']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/strip-club-to-host-golf-tournament-at-trump-resort-in-south-florida/2019/07/09/52a83504-a266-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html,"President Trump’s golf resort in Doral, Fla., is scheduled to host a golf tournament Saturday put on by a Miami-area strip club, which will allow golfers to pay for a dancer to serve as their “caddy girl” while they play at the president’s club.

The “Shadow All Star Tournament” is organized by the Shadow Cabaret, a strip club in Hialeah, Fla. Emanuele Mancuso, Shadow Cabaret’s marketing director, said in a telephone interview that this was the first time the club had held a tournament at Trump Doral.

The Trump name and family crest are displayed prominently in the strip club’s advertising materials, which offer golfers the “caddy girl of your choice.”

Mancuso said the strip club did not intend to send a political statement by choosing Trump’s resort. Rather, he said, the choice was for luxury. These golfers are VIPs, Mancuso said. “They deserve a VIP environment.”

Mancuso said there would be no nudity at the resort. On the course, he said, the caddies would wear pink miniskirts and what he called “a sexy white polo.” Afterward, however, the golfers and the dancers would return to another venue — the cabaret itself — for what he described as a “very tasteful” burlesque show, which could involve nudity.

“They’re going to be clothed the whole time” at the golf course, Mancuso said. “At the venue is different.”

In a statement, the Trump Organization confirmed the event is happening and said it was for a “worthwhile cause” — a Miami children’s charity. A spokeswoman said the company had not approved the tournament’s advertisements before they were published.

Trump still owns Doral — and all his other businesses — while in office, but he has given day-to-day control to his sons Don Jr. and Eric.

Doral is better known for a different kind of golf tournament, a long-running PGA Tour event that was last played there in 2016. It is one of the jewels of Trump’s hotel empire — a legendary 57-year-old golf resort that Trump bought for $150 million in 2012.

After Trump entered politics, however, the club lost the famous tournament, and its revenue began to decline, according to documents that Trump’s company provided to Miami-Dade County in a tax dispute.

Those documents showed that the club’s net operating income fell 69 percent between 2015 and 2017. The club’s revenue rebounded slightly in 2018, according to Trump’s financial disclosure forms.

“They are severely underperforming” other resorts in the area, said a tax consultant for Trump’s company, arguing in a public hearing that the county should lower the resort’s tax assessment. She blamed the Trump name: “There is some negative connotation that is associated with the brand.”

Shadow Cabaret advertises that its strip club offers all-nude dancers, a laser light show and a decor inspired by the Miami drug epic “Scarface.”

It has been advertising the golf tournament at Doral online, on Facebook, on Instagram and via the industry website exoticdancer.com. It offers packages that claim to combine hotel rooms at Doral with services at the strip club: a $1,000 “VIP Upgrade,” for instance, includes three days at the hotel and “1/2 Hour VIP Room + Bottle @ Club.”

Mancuso, the cabaret’s marketing director, said the first event connected with the tournament will be a reception at the cabaret on Friday night.

“If you enroll before the 10th [of July], you are able to pick out your caddie girl,” he said. “Everybody that enrolled after the 10th, they’re going to have an auction” that night.

Mancuso said the dancers would drive a golf cart and not carry golf bags as some caddies do. “They’re actually going through training, most of the girls,” to be able to advise players on golf shots, he said.

Mancuso said the tournament would benefit a basketball-themed charity called Miami All Stars. Online advertisements for the tournament also include logos for the Jr. NBA and Jr. WNBA.

Carlos Alamilla, the charity’s director, said his group serves about 40 youths in Miami. “We provide everything. We provide fitness, nutrition, basketball and academics,” he said.

The charity’s website says it is “a non-profit organization under the laws of the State of Florida.” However, Franco Ripple, a spokesman for the state, said Tuesday that it is not registered as a charity in Florida. Alamilla did not immediately respond to questions about why his organization’s name was missing from state records.

A spokeswoman for the NBA and WNBA said that the leagues were not affiliated with the tournament and that their logos were used in the ads without permission.

Alamilla said it gave him pause to affiliate his charity with an event put on by a strip club: “It doesn’t jive with what we do, you know.” He said he also dislikes Trump because of the conditions in which his administration is detaining migrant children. “He’s contrary to everything we believe,” he said of the president.

Still, Alamilla said, he decided to accept the money — but also ban his charity’s child clients from attending.

“None of my kids are going to be participating in your event,” he said he told the organizers. But, he said, “if we can get some help, you know, for our programs starting now . . . it would be okay.”"
"Trump Can’t Block Critics From His Twitter Account, Appeals Court Rules",https://www.nytimes.com,['Charlie Savage'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-twitter-first-amendment.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from following his Twitter account because they criticized or mocked him, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The ruling could have broader implications for how the First Amendment applies to the social-media era.

Because Mr. Trump uses Twitter to conduct government business, he cannot exclude some Americans from reading his posts — and engaging in conversations in the replies to them — because he does not like their views, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, ruled unanimously.

The ruling was one of the highest-profile court decisions yet in a growing constellation of cases addressing what the First Amendment means in a time when political expression increasingly takes place online. It is also a time, Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote, when government conduct is subject to a “wide-open, robust debate” that “generates a level of passion and intensity the likes of which have rarely been seen.”

The First Amendment prohibits an official who uses a social media account for government purposes from excluding people from an “otherwise open online dialogue” because they say things that the official finds objectionable, Judge Parker wrote."
"Justice Dept. Tells Mueller Deputies Not to Testify, Scrambling an Agreement",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Katie Benner']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/mueller-testimony-justice-department.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is seeking to discourage Robert S. Mueller III’s deputies from testifying before Congress, potentially jeopardizing an agreement for two of the former prosecutors to answer lawmakers’ questions in private next week, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

The department told the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees last week that it was opposed to the testimony and had communicated its view to the two former members of Mr. Mueller’s team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the discussions. A Justice Department official confirmed that account and said that the department had instructed both men not to appear.

It is unclear what effect the Justice Department’s intervention will have on the men’s eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel.

Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department’s view — depending on how strongly it is expressed — could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying."
Federal judge says DOJ can't swap out its legal team in census case,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/federal-judge-doj-census-legal-team/index.html,"(CNN) A federal judge in New York said on Tuesday that the Justice Department cannot swap out its legal team in the census citizenship question case, yet another twist in a case tossed into tumult by a Supreme Court decision last month.

""Defendants provide no reasons, let alone 'satisfactory reasons,' for the substitution of counsel,"" wrote District Judge Jesse Furman, citing upcoming deadlines , of the department's attempt to put new lawyers on the case.

""As this Court observed many months ago, this case has been litigated on the premise -- based 'in no small part' on Defendants' own 'insist(ence)' -- that the speedy resolution of Plaintiffs' claims is a matter of great private and public importance.""

Furman also may review requests from the civil rights groups suing the administration to issue sanctions in the case because administration witnesses allegedly weren't truthful, and to stop the administration from making any changes to the census.

Former State Department employee sentenced to more than three years in China spy case,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-state-department-employee-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-china-spy-case,"A federal judge sentenced former State Department employee Candace Claiborne to more than three years in prison and a $40,000 fine Tuesday for accepting thousands of dollars in cash and gifts from Chinese intelligence agents in exchange for information.

U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss said, “sentencing is never easy,” but also called Claiborne’s crime, “a truly grave offense, a betrayal of her employer and a betrayal of her country” before giving her 40 months in prison in a Washington D.C. courtroom.

Claiborne, 63, whom Moss agreed up until now had been a model citizen with no criminal history, said, “I’m sorry for what I did.” She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in April and faced up to five years in prison.

STATE DEPT. CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY PAID BY CHINESE AGENT TO SPY ON AMERICANS – YET NO CHARGES FILED

Claiborne, who held a top-secret security clearance, began working as an Office Management Specialist for the State Department in 1999. She served in multiple postings in Baghdad and Khartoum, Sudan, as well as Beijing and Shanghai.

“This is not what I had envisioned for my life... I still don’t know how I lost myself,” Claiborne told the judge. ""I lost my job, reputation and the trust of the government. I made a terrible mistake and now I'm paying the price.""

Federal prosecutor Thomas Gillice pressed for the maximum sentence, saying Claiborne knew what she was doing was wrong and kept doing it for her own financial gain for a long period of time.

“She did this repeatedly over a period of years and at the expense of her country,” said Gillice.

The government produced extensive evidence of contacts between Claiborne and two Chinese intelligence agents, including emails, text messages and at least one voicemail. Some of the documents she shared with the agents included U.S. economic strategies and visits by dignitaries between the two countries.

WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS

Prosecutors highlighted some of the conduct that occurred in 2011.

Over five years, the agents provided Claiborne with cash, meals, tuition payments for a Chinese fashion school, vacations, a furnished apartment, a laptop, a phone and a monthly stipend. Some of the gifts were given directly to Claiborne and others to her close family members.

In her journal, she noted that working for one of the agents could “Generate 20k in 1 year,"" the Justice Department said. In an email between Claiborne and a Chinese agent, the agent said: ""I will help your kids and also you make money in China.""

""Sounds like a plan!"" replied Claiborne.

Prosecutors also presented a ledger from Claiborne that specified a to-do list, which included ""Clean up Yahoo contacts.""

Moss noted that none of the information Claiborne gave to the Chinese was classified, but said it was still internal government information and that he wanted to send a message that this kind of conduct was “unacceptable.”

""If this has been classified information we would be talking about a sentence three or four times longer than this,"" Moss said.

In an effort to conceal her crimes, Claiborne instructed her co-conspirators to delete evidence of her connection to the agents.

As a term of her sentencing, Claiborne will also serve 36 months of supervised release and will sit down for an interview with the FBI as well as cooperate for a video with the State Department that may be used as a deterrent for current employees."
Justice Dept. Watchdog Is Preparing to Deliver Verdict on the Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Adam Goldman', 'Charlie Savage', 'Matthew Rosenberg']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/ig-russia-investigation-steele.html,"Mr. Trump’s allies have sought to conflate the much broader Russia investigation with the dossier and have increased their attacks since the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded that while the campaign welcomed and expected to benefit from Russia’s election interference, the evidence did not prove any conspiracy.

Investigators working for Mr. Horowitz have asked witnesses about whether the F.B.I. properly opened the Russia investigation and how the bureau handled a pair of informants, including Mr. Steele, whose work was financed by Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Reuters first reported the investigators’ interview of Mr. Steele. They have conducted more than 100 interviews and have begun drafting their report, Mr. Horowitz wrote to lawmakers last month.

Mr. Horowitz is expected to answer whether Mr. Steele’s information played a role in opening the Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. Former law enforcement officials have insisted it did not, saying they opened the inquiry in July 2016. The Steele dossier did not reach the relevant agents until Sept. 19, 2016, nearly two months later, people familiar with the matter have said.

But the primary focus of the inspector general’s inquiry is the role that Mr. Steele’s information played in investigators’ effort to obtain court permission to wiretap Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved the application on Oct. 21, 2016, about a month after Mr. Page had left the campaign, and the wiretap order — one of 1,559 the court issued that year — was renewed three times in 2017, including twice by Trump-era Justice Department officials.

In August 2016, a month before agents on the Russia investigation received the Steele dossier, they had already started discussions with the Justice Department about seeking a wiretap order targeting Mr. Page, according to people familiar with the investigation’s timeline. Agents identified Mr. Page as a potential conduit between the campaign and Moscow, if there was any, because he had close business ties to Russia, had traveled there in July after joining the campaign, and had been targeted as a potential recruit by Russian intelligence agents in 2013 — yet did not seem concerned when the F.B.I. talked to him about it.

Still, the arrival of the dossier in September kicked the deliberations over whether to seek a wiretap order into a higher gear, according to people familiar with the Russia investigation. By adding further weight to their reasons to be suspicious of Mr. Page, Mr. Steele’s information helped officials overcome bureaucratic reluctance stemming from fears that any leak of the existence of such a wiretap would be politically radioactive."
House Judiciary Dems prepare slew of subpoenas for Trump-tied targets,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-judiciary-democrats-to-authorize-subpoenas-for-12-individuals-connected-to-trump-as-part-of-obstruction-of-justice-probe,"House Judiciary Committee Democrats announced Tuesday that they plan to authorize subpoenas later this week for a dozen individuals connected to President Trump as part of the panel’s escalating probe into obstruction of justice, public corruption and other alleged abuses by the president.

The list of targets includes Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his old deputy Rod Rosenstein.

Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that the panel is moving forward with “efforts to request information from critical witnesses as part of our ongoing investigation into obstruction, corruption, and abuse of power by the President and his associates.”

NADLER LAUNCHES EXPANSIVE TRUMP PROBE

The committee plans to mark up the resolution authorizing the subpoenas on Thursday, an effort that comes ahead of high-profile hearings next week featuring former Special Counsel Robert Mueller himself.

The latest burst of planned subpoenas prompted criticism from the committee's top Republican, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins.

“Today’s latest effort to relitigate the special counsel’s investigation remains unimpressive and unproductive. Mr. Mueller’s team issued more than 2,800 subpoenas before concluding that no Americans conspired with Russia. Even if Chairman Nadler still believes subpoenas are conversation starters, it’s hard to imagine this handful of subpoenas will do anything but reinforce the principal conclusions we’ve been able to read about for months,” Collins said in a statement.

The individuals subject to fresh subpoena are: Sessions; Rosenstein; Kushner; former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn; former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn; former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly; former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski; former White House aide Rob Porter; publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker and chief content officer Dylan Howard; former Stormy Daniels lawyer Keith Davidson; and assistant attorney general for the criminal division Joseph “Jody” Hunt.

NADLER PROBE TARGETS MISS DEADLINE IN SWEEPING DOCUMENT REQUEST

Earlier this year, Nadler made a sweeping request for documents as part of the expansive Trump probe, calling for responses from 81 agencies, entities and individuals. Nadler sent document requests the majority of the individuals the committee plans to subpoena this week, including Kushner, Flynn, Sessions, Lewandowski, and others. In March, a GOP source on the committee told Fox News that only a small group had provided documents and met the Nadler-imposed deadline.

“I remain open to reaching a reasonable accommodation and will not issue subpoenas if the information we are seeking is voluntarily provided,” Nadler said Tuesday. “We will get answers one way or the other.”

Nadler’s committee has also been locked in battle with the Trump administration on other fronts, voting to hold current and former Trump administration officials in contempt for defying congressionally issued subpoenas. In April, Trump vowed to block any and all subpoenas against members of his administration.

“We’re fighting all of the subpoenas,” Trump said in April. “Look, these aren’t like, impartial people. They are Democrats trying to win in 2020…They’re not going to win against me.”

He added, at the time, that “the only way they can luck out is by constantly going after me on nonsense.”

Nadler’s announcement comes as Felix Sater, the Russian-born real estate developer tied to the Trump Organization’s past plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, appeared on Capitol Hill for an interview before the House Intelligence Committee. Chairman Adam Schiff subpoenaed Sater last month after he failed to appear for a voluntary private interview with the committee.

Sater’s testimony was scheduled as part of that committee’s continued investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller said there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Russia and members of the Trump campaign, but said there were dozens of contacts between the two. Schiff has vowed to investigate some of those contacts."
Federal judge rejects Trump administration’s bid to swap out lawyers for census case on citizenship question,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'Seung Min Kim', 'White House Reporter', 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Reporter Focusing On Aging', 'Generations', 'July At Pm']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-rejects-trump-administrations-bid-to-swap-out-lawyers-for-census-case-on-citizenship-question/2019/07/09/d12f811e-a24f-11e9-b7b4-95e30869bd15_story.html,"A federal judge in New York on Tuesday denied a bid from the Justice Department to replace the team of lawyers on the case about the census citizenship question, writing that its request to do so was “patently deficient.”

The department had earlier this week announced its intention to swap out the legal team on the case, without saying exactly why.

A person familiar with the matter said the decision was driven in part by frustration among some of the career lawyers who had been assigned to the case about how it was being handled, though the department wanted to replace those in both career and political positions.

But U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman denied the formal, legal bid to do so.

“Defendants provide no reasons, let alone ‘satisfactory reasons,’ for the substitution of counsel,” Furman wrote. He also noted that a filing in the case was due from the department in just three days, and that the department had previously pushed for the matter to be moved along quickly.

“If anything, that urgency — and the need for efficient judicial proceedings — has only grown since that time,” Furman wrote.

President Trump said on Twitter: “So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?”

Furman said the department could refile its request, if it gave “satisfactory reasons” for the attorneys’ withdrawal and promises that the attorneys who had worked the case previously would be available upon request. The judge also asked the department to “file an affidavit providing unequivocal assurances that the substitution of counsel will not delay further litigation of this case (or any future related case).”

Furman did allow two attorneys who had previously left the Justice Department or its Civil Division to be removed.

The judge’s decision was the latest development in the continuing effort by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

In a ruling late last month, the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration’s plan to add the question, saying the government had provided a “contrived” reason for wanting the citizenship information.

The Justice and Commerce departments then effectively conceded defeat — but Trump soon ordered the lawyers to do an about-face and come up with ways to keep the fight alive.

Furman’s move could force the Justice Department to expose more of its messy, internal debates over the census case. Those attorneys who object to the handling of it might proceed without signing briefs, serving up a regular, public reminder of how fraught the case has become internally. The department might also choose to lay out more detailed reasons for wanting the attorneys off in a subsequent request.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the judge’s decision.

New York Attorney General Letitia James took a tacit swipe at Trump in reacting to the ruling.

“Despite the president attempting to fire his lawyers, this is not an episode of ‘The Apprentice.’ Judge Furman denied his request and required the administration to comply with the rules regarding substitution of counsel, ” said James, in a reference to Trump’s onetime television show.

Justin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Law School who was a deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division from 2015 to 2017, said he had never seen the department swap out an entire team in the middle of litigating a case.

The move was particularly odd given that the previous team was composed of experts in administrative procedure who were steeped in the details of the census litigation, he said. The new team, pulled together from the department’s consumer protection, civil fraud, and office of immigration litigation components, is “a truly random assortment,” he said.

“It’s a hodgepodge of people whose roles have absolutely nothing do to with the conduct of the census or with proper administrative procedure. That should give everybody pause about what’s coming next.”

Intensifying the political battle, House Democrats threatened to block funding for government efforts to ask about citizenship status as the White House continued to ponder an executive order to force the issue.

“I have no intention of allowing this flagrant waste of money,” Rep. José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), who leads the House panel overseeing funding for the Commerce and Justice departments, said in a statement. “I once again urge the Trump administration to give up this fight and allow for a depoliticized and accurate census, as we always have.”

A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee confirmed Democrats would seek to block taxpayer money from funding any efforts by the Trump administration to ask about citizenship in next year’s survey “if the issue has not been rendered moot by the courts.”

Critics of the question say it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate number that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

Data from the constitutionally mandated enumeration of all people living in the United States is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending per year.

It is also used to determine congressional apportionment and redistricting.

But several Republicans on Tuesday pushed back in defense of the administration’s efforts to ask about citizenship on the census form, which has not included a question on that matter since 1950.



“The census in the past . . . has been increasingly responsive to changes in American demography,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday on Fox News. “I ask that all the time, what are you afraid of? Why wouldn’t you want to know who’s living in this country and who’s a citizen and who’s not a citizen?”

The White House had backup from allies on Capitol Hill, who took to the airwaves and on Twitter to also make their case.

“Of all the questions we ask, this should be one of the most basic,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a close administration ally, tweeted Tuesday afternoon. “All hands ought to be on deck to get this done.”

Trump said late last week that he was exploring an executive order to continue efforts to add a question about citizenship to the Census.

One option administration officials have floated for adding the question after forms are printed is to print a supplement that contains the question. But while digital forms can be altered up until the last minute, inserting an additional question into the packet to be mailed to people's homes would create logistic and scientific problems, experts say.

“The idea of printing an addendum seems to be fraught with confusion and I think it would be a big mistake,” said John Thompson, who was Census Bureau director until 2017. “It would go against all kinds of questionnaire design methods — but that doesn’t seem to have bothered them yet.”

The placement of a question on the form can significantly affect response rates, and is normally thoroughly tested in the field before a new question is added. Ross proposed adding the citizenship question after testing of forms without the question was already underway; the bureau is currently testing a version that includes the question.

When it was anticipating a win in the Supreme Court, the government held fast against the possibility of pushing past the July 1 deadline. In a filing last month, Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court that an assertion by one of the plaintiffs that the forms could be finalized as late as Oct. 31 “is unsupported by the record.”

Other brewing fights are sure to keep the Census issue front and center in the coming weeks.

The Democratic-led House is set to vote before leaving for their August recess to hold both Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas related to the administration’s decision to include the citizenship question. The White House has asserted executive privilege over the information."
Former State Department employee sentenced to 40 months for taking gifts from Chinese intelligence,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/state-department-chinese-spies-sentenced/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A former State Department employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison Tuesday after she pleaded guilty in April to trading sensitive information with Chinese intelligence officers in exchange for lavish gifts.

Candace Claiborne, who had worked for the State Department in countries across the globe since 1999, will also face three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000, according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.

""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face, and today's sentencing shows that those who betray the trust of the American people will be held accountable for their actions,"" said John P. Selleck, the acting assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.

Claiborne was charged in 2017 with taking gifts -- including electronics, vacations and a fully-furnished apartment, as well tuition payments to a Chinese fashion school for a family member -- from two Chinese officials. She was also charged with lying about her interactions with the officials on clearance forms and in interviews with government background investigators.

According to plea documents, Claiborne met with the intelligence officials monthly while on a posting in China and on multiple occasions handed over manila envelopes stuffed with printed cables, white papers and other non-public documents about the movements and discussions of US diplomats.

Trump dossier author Steele gets 16-hour DOJ grilling,https://www.politico.com,['Natasha Bertrand'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/09/christopher-steele-trump-dossier-doj-1403318,"During the 2016 election, Christopher Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to research President Donald Trump’s Russia ties. | Victoria Jones/AP Photo Foreign Policy Trump dossier author Steele gets 16-hour DOJ grilling The interview was contentious at first, according to two people familiar with the matter, but investigators ultimately found his testimony credible and even surprising.

Christopher Steele, the former British spy behind the infamous “dossier” on President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, was interviewed for 16 hours in June by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The interview is part of an ongoing investigation that the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has been conducting for the past year. Specifically, Horowitz has been examining the FBI’s efforts to surveil a one-time Trump campaign adviser based in part on information from Steele, an ex-British MI6 agent who had worked with the bureau as a confidential source since 2010.

Story Continued Below

Horowitz’s team has been intensely focused on gauging Steele’s credibility as a source for the bureau. But Steele was initially reluctant to speak with the American investigators because of the potential impropriety of his involvement in an internal DOJ probe as a foreign national and retired British intelligence agent.

Steele’s allies have also repeatedly noted that the dossier was not the original basis for the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia.

The extensive, two-day interview took place in London while Trump was in Britain for a state visit, the sources said, and delved into Steele’s extensive work on Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence-collection methods and his findings about Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who the FBI ultimately surveilled. The FBI’s decision to seek a surveillance warrant against Page — a warrant they applied for and obtained after Page had already left the campaign — is the chief focus of the probe by Horowitz.

The interview was contentious at first, the sources added, but investigators ultimately found Steele’s testimony credible and even surprising. The takeaway has irked some U.S. officials interviewed as part of the probe — they argue that it shouldn’t have taken a foreign national to convince the inspector general that the FBI acted properly in 2016. Steele’s American lawyer was present for the conversation.

The interview was first reported by Reuters.

During the 2016 election, Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to research Trump’s Russia ties. His work was funded in part by a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee.

Since then, Steele has become a villain to Trump allies who claim that anti-Trump DOJ officials conspired to undo the results of the 2016 election. Conservatives have also seized on Mueller’s conclusion that no criminal conspiracy existed between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin as evidence that Steele’s sensational dossier was a fraud.

But the extensive interview with Steele, and the investigators’ sense that he offered new and important information, may dampen expectations among the president’s allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to “spy” on the campaign.

Page had been on the FBI’s radar since 2013, when he interacted with undercover Russian intelligence agents in New York City. A trip to Moscow in the summer of 2016 further aroused the bureau’s suspicions, according to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant the FBI got approved in October 2016, allowing the bureau to intercept his electronic communications.

Steele’s defenders have noted that the information he provided which made it into the FISA warrant application to monitor Page was not far off. According to Steele’s sources, Page met with high-level Russian officials while in Moscow in July 2016, including the CEO of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Page denied the claim publicly until pressed under oath by lawmakers in 2017, when he acknowledged meeting “senior members of the presidential administration” during his trip, as well as the head of investor relations at Rosneft. Page had originally claimed only that he went to Moscow to give the commencement address at the New Economic School."
Attorney General Bill Barr will not recuse himself from Jeffrey Epstein child sex prosecution,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Dan Mangan Jim Forkin', 'Dan Mangan', 'Jim Forkin']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/bill-barr-will-not-recuse-himself-in-jeffrey-epstein-prosecution.html,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee May 1, 2019 in Washington, DC. Barr testified on the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election.

However, Barr was quoted Monday as saying he was recusing himself from the Epstein case.

A Justice Department official on Tuesday said that Barr consulted with career ethics officials at the department, and concluded he did not have to recuse himself from the current prosecution in Manhattan.

Epstein was being eyed for the same alleged conduct in Florida that federal prosecutors have now charged him with in Manhattan.

Epstein, 66, is accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 after they were brought to his luxurious residences on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and in Palm Beach, Florida, under the pretext of giving him massages.

And it came as a bevy of Democratic members of Congress and presidential candidates demanded that Acosta resign because of his role as then-U.S. attorney in Miami in signing off on a deal to not prosecute Epstein in the mid-2000s.

Barr's announced decision to have oversight of the Epstein prosecution came after reports that he had recused himself from the case, which is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

But Barr will recuse himself from an internal Justice Department probe of current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta's involvement in approving a controversial no-prosecution deal with the wealthy financier a decade ago, an official said.

Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from involvement in the new federal criminal prosecution of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein , an official said Tuesday.

""I'm recused from that matter because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time,"" Barr told reporters Monday.

Barr joined that law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, in 2009.

Kirkland & Ellis had represented Epstein in 2008, when he was being investigated in Florida. Acosta also previously had worked at Kirkland & Ellis.

Barr's comment Monday seems to have referred — or does so now — to his continued recusal from the Justice Department's internal probe into the nonprosecution of Epstein as signed off by Acosta.

""Due to his prior association with Kirkland and Ellis, the Attorney General has and will remain recused from any retrospective review of the resolution of the earlier [Southern District of Florida] matter,"" the Justice Department official told CNBC on Tuesday.

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director, told CNBC that Barr was making ""a distinction without a difference"" in jutisfying his decisions to recuse himself in one instance related to Epstein, but not the other one. He said that Barr's work for a firm that represented Epstein was enough to justify recusing himself from overseeing the current prosecution.

Figliuzzi, who is a national security contributor to NBC News, said that the issues in the current prosecution and the decision not to prosecute Epstein a decade ago are ""inexorably linked,"" and that Barr should have recused himself in both cases.

And Figliuzzi said that even without Barr's connection to Kirkland & Ellis, there was another reason for Barr to recuse himself from anything to do with Epstein.

Figliuzzi cited press reports that Barr's father, while serving as headmaster of the exclusive Dalton private school in Manhattan in the 1970s, had hired a 20-something Epstein to teach math despite Epstein not having a college degree.

Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state charge of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and felony solicitation of prostitution. He was sentenced to 13 months incarceration, but most of that time was spent on work release or in the private wing of a jail.

Epstein registered as a sex offender in Florida under the nonprosecution agreement he signed with the Miami U.S. Attorney's Office then led by Acosta.

A federal judge in February said that Acosta and other federal prosecutors had violated the rights of Epstein's victims during their probe of him in Florida by failing to notify the victims that they had cut a nonprosecution deal with him, while leading the woman to believe that federal charges were still a possibility.

The Miami Herald had reported that Acosta helped arranged the deal under which Epstein would plead guilty to the relatively minor state charge, and hide the agreement with victims until the arrangement was presented in court.

The Justice Department in February launched its internal probe into how Acosta and other prosecutors handled the Epstein case, and into the question of whether they committed professional misconduct.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Acosta has ""been a very good secretary of Labor.""

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday joined the growing chorus of calls for Acosta to step down from the Labor Department.

""Epstein should have been behind bars years ago, but unfortunately Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta cut Epstein a sweetheart deal while Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida in 2008,"" Schumer said.

""I am calling on Secretary Acosta to resign. It is now impossible for anyone to have confidence in Secretary Acosta's ability to lead the department of Labor,"" Schumer said. ""If he refuses to resign President Trump should fire him. Instead of prosecuting a predator and serial sex trafficker of children, Acosta chose to let him off easy. ""

Acosta, who has resisted calls to quit, tweeted his support of the New York prosecution on Tuesday."
"Border apprehensions decline 28 percent following US-Mexico partnership, DHS says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Deputy Commissioner For U.S. Customs', 'Border Protection Robert Perez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-apprehensions-decline-dramatically-following-us-mexico-partnership,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that apprehensions at the southwest border plummeted in June after the Mexican government agreed early in the month -- under the threat of punishing U.S. tariffs -- to dramatically step up its own immigration enforcement efforts.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data showed a 28 percent drop in apprehensions from May, when 144,278 individuals were detained. Although some analysts blamed the ""summer heat"" for part of the new decline, the Trump administration noted in a statement that the decline in apprehensions ""outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent"" in the same period.

The numbers refer to would-be immigrants caught trying to illegally cross the border, and not migrants who approach ports of entry.

The reduction in apprehensions ""accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala,"" DHS said in a statement.

""Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care,"" the statement continued.

Law enforcement and administration officials said President Trump's hard push for the deal with Mexico had made all the difference. Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday that morale among law enforcement at the border had increased.

BORDER PATROL DECLARES 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY,' AS FORMER DHS OFFICIAL SAYS 'DESPERATION' HAS SET IN

""I think it's a combination of a few things,"" Perez said. ""I think it certainly is an unprecedented agreement that we've made with Mexico, that the president was able to secure about a month ago. We are definitely seeing and are encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken.""

Some Republicans, however, were not pleaded with Mexico's efforts. Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter that it was ""unacceptable"" to see the fourth straight month of more than 100,000 border arrests, even though he praised the decrease in monthly apprehensions as a ""good"" sign.

""The President was right to demand more from Mexico,"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Now some actions from Congress would be nice.""

Earlier in June, Mexico committed to deploy thousands of National Guard troops throughout Mexico, including at its northern and southern land borders, as well as to increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico just prior to that breakthrough, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% [sic] level ...!""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% [sic] Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump warned on May 30. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Shortly after Trump's threat but before the deal was reached, Mexico's financial intelligence agency announced it had frozen the bank accounts of 26 people who it claimed to ""have presumably participated in migrant smuggling and the organization of illegal migrant caravans.""

MEXICO USING X-RAY TECHNOLOGY TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

The agency said it had detected money transfers from central Mexico to six Mexican border cities presumably related to the caravans.

And some 200 Mexican military police, immigration agents and federal police blocked the advance of about 1,000 Central American migrants who were walking north along a highway in the southern part of the country.

""We are definitely seeing and are encouragd by the steps Mexico has taken."" — Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez

The group of migrants, including many women and children, set out early from Ciudad Hidalgo at the Mexico-Guatemala border and was headed for Tapachula, the principal city in the region. State and local police accompanied the caravan. The officials blocked the highway near the community of Metapa, about 11 miles from Tapachula.

And this week, it emerged that while the Mexican National Guard deploys to places like Tapachula on the country's southern border and makes changes to its asylum protocol, agents with the country's National Migration Institute (INM) are using a giant X-ray to find migrants being smuggled into the country in trucks.

Mexican officials said they caught more than 200 migrants hidden in trucks the last two days, using X-rays to see the people hidden inside.

The Mexican security ministry also said it found 228 migrants in a routine search of a soft drink transportation truck in one of its southern states on Monday.

US rift with UK deepens as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cancels meeting over presence of British ambassador,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-cancels-meeting-with-uk-trade-minister-over-presence-of-british-ambassador,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross abruptly canceled a long-planned meeting with Britain's Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox Tuesday because the British Ambassador to the U.S. Kim Darroch was also due to attend.

A Trump administration source said that the meeting was jettisoned because of the row over leaked secret cables from Darroch that described President Trump as ""inept"" and ""incompetent."" The source said that it showed the rift between the Trump administration over the leaks was ""a real thing"" and growing.

The source said that Ross has been on personally ""warm and friendly"" terms with Darroch, who has been ambassador since January 2016, sitting down for dinner with him only a few days ago. The cancellation of the meeting calls into question the ability of Darroch, 65, to do his job and could hasten his recall to London.

On Monday, Darroch's invitation to a White House dinner was rescinded. On Tuesday morning, hours before the planned meeting with Ross, Trump mocked Darroch via Twitter, describing him as a ""pompous guy"" and a ""very stupid fool.""

President Trump said Sunday Darroch had “not served the UK well” by writing in official cables to London, subsequently leaked to the public, that the White House was “uniquely dysfunctional” and “inept."" He added: ""We are not big fans of that man … I can say things about him, but I won’t bother.""

Fox, a longtime ally of Washington conservatives, has criticized the leaks but defended Darroch, saying he was ""held in high regard."" He told BBC Radio Monday: ""It’s not a problem with the ambassador. This a problem with the ethics of the individual who carried out this particular leak.""

Darroch, a former British national security adviser and ambassador to the European Union, was due to leave his post at the end of the year and to retire. A Commerce Department spokesman could not be reached for comment."

Former DOJ Lawyer Says Census Drama Put Attorneys in “Completely Untenable” Position,https://slate.com,['Jeremy Stahl'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-census-william-barr-john-roberts-lawyer-change.html,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington. Joe Raedle/Getty Images

The latest bizarre twist in the Census citizenship question case came on Sunday when the Department of Justice announced that the entire team of lawyers defending the government’s position in ongoing litigation would be replaced. The highly unusual move was confirmed on Monday in a series of court filings. It is likely at the behest of career officials uncomfortable with the government’s position moving forward, according to former DOJ attorneys. The lawyers on the case told the courts last week that the administration would stop trying to add the citizenship question to the census, but were quickly forced to reverse that position after President Donald Trump tweeted that reports of the decision to back down were “fake.” The sudden change in lawyers suggests there is some internal recognition that the government’s latest census stance has become untenable.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec announced the change on Sunday, declaring that Attorney General William Barr “is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion [as the previous team] as the cases progress.”

The government has been tight-lipped about the reasons behind the switch. According to multiple former DOJ officials, however, the move would have only come if the attorneys who had been working on the case had profound reservations about the task ahead and asked to be removed.

“It’s an extremely unusual thing for an entire office to take itself off of a case in the middle of a case,” one former DOJ attorney, who worked under this administration, told Slate. “[These are] attorneys with the highest standards of integrity and highest standards of professionalism. I can only imagine they were in the very difficult position of being forced to contradict factual representations they had made previously.”

“That the entire office is being substituted out really indicates […] something strange,” the former attorney, who requested anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions, added.

Another former DOJ official also speculated to the New York Times that the unusual move was likely because the original legal team was refusing to reverse course.

“There is no reason they would be taken off that case unless they saw what was coming down the road and said, ‘I won’t sign my name to that,’ ” Justin Levitt, a former senior official in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times on Sunday.

The Times further confirmed that not only would career officials from the DOJ’s federal programs branch—the branch normally responsible for defending administration policies in court—be leaving the case, but a completely new branch would be taking over.

Indeed, it has become clear over the past week that the DOJ would need to argue positions that completely contradict those previously taken in court by the original team. Last month, the Supreme Court remanded the decision about the citizenship question back to the Commerce Department after Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s more liberal wing to determine that the department had unlawfully “contrived” its reason for adding the question to the census. Since the justices essentially ruled the original explanation—that the question was added to aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—was a lie, any renewed effort to add the question would require DOJ attorneys to acknowledge their past position had been false and represent that a new one was the true motivation all along.

Faced with this challenge, both the DOJ and Commerce Department seemed to take Roberts’ ruling as their cue to drop the case last week, even representing in court that the 2020 census forms would be printed without the question and no further attempts to add it would go forward. DOJ lawyers reportedly spent the July Fourth holiday scrambling to find a new justification that would pass legal muster following Trump’s comments to the contrary.

The final substantive legal filing from the old legal team came on Friday, when that team argued in court that a renewed equal protection claim was now “moot” because of the Supreme Court’s decision, and thus that discovery should not go forward in a reopened equal protection claim in Maryland. That element of the case was revived late last month after the uncovering of previously secret evidence that the citizenship question had been concocted to offer “a disadvantage to the Democrats” and be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” After that evidence was found, Maryland District Judge George Hazel reopened the discrimination claim, and on Friday he ordered renewed discovery on that question to begin immediately and run through Aug. 19.

Administration attorneys had repeatedly insisted in court that they had a firm deadline of July 1 to print the census forms. Now, the new lawyers will apparently have to concede that this deadline was not real. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, for example, had told the Supreme Court that a decision in the case had to be made by the end of June, rejecting claims by opponents of the citizenship question that the form could be finalized as late as Oct. 31 without additional congressional appropriations. As former Office of Legal Counsel attorney Marty Lederman has written, now that the deadline has come and gone, DOJ attorneys will have to go into court and essentially say, oops, just kidding, we can do this without further funds from Congress after all.

“Being in a position now to deny those statements is something that would have been really untenable,” the former DOJ attorney told Slate. “From the point of view of the court hearing the case, they’re going to hear some set of attorneys making some argument that ‘you should ignore everything we’ve been saying for the last year plus,’ and that’s going to be a difficult sell for whoever’s making it.”

The administration apparently thinks it will be easier for a new set of lawyers to argue the new position than the specific attorneys who had previously argued the opposite. “An administration official said the new legal team may find it easier to argue the administration’s new position,” the Associated Press reported on Monday.

Indeed, the former DOJ attorney said, being “in the position of contradicting factual positions they themselves have made to the court for those particular attorneys would just be a completely untenable position for them to be in.”"

U.S. State Department approves possible $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/u-s-state-department-approves-possible-2-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1U32HT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Taiwan of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an estimated value of $2.2 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday, despite Chinese criticism of the deal.

China’s foreign ministry expressed anger about the sale and urged the United States to revoke it. The timing is especially sensitive as the Washington and Beijing are seeking to resolve a bitter trade war.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, would not alter the basic military balance in the region.

DSCA notified Congress on Monday of the possible arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative tanks, heavy equipment transporters and related support.

Reuters reported last month that an informal notification of the proposed sale had been sent to the U.S. Congress.

The United States has no formal ties with self-ruled and democratic Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a serious violation of international law and a “crude interference in China’s internal affairs, harming China’s sovereignty and security interests.”

“China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this and has already made stern representations to the US side,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

“Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory and nobody should underestimate the Chinese government’s and people’s firm determination to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose foreign interference.”

China urged the United States to immediately revoke the planned arms sale and end all contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added.

Taiwan’s Presidential Office expressed “sincere gratitude” to the U.S. government for the arms sale.

“Taiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,” Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan’s president, said in a statement.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.

The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taipei’s military raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said last month in a statement."
Justice Dept. Seeks to Halt Democrats’ Suit Over Trump’s Profits in Office,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Monday asked a federal appeals court to issue an emergency order halting a lawsuit by congressional Democrats that alleges that President Trump has illegally profited from his family business while in office.

In a court filing, the department’s lawyers asserted that Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia had committed a series of “clear and indisputable” legal errors in allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The most glaring of them, the department said, was his decision that members of Congress had legal standing to sue the president.

Judge Sullivan, they argued in a filing to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrongly treated a complaint based on novel and flawed legal constitutional arguments as if it were “a run-of-the-mill commercial dispute.” If the appeals court refuses to intervene, they argued, the case will proceed into the evidence-gathering phase, in which Mr. Trump will be forced to reveal details of his financial affairs."
Trump administration will issue licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei,https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/us-will-issue-licenses-to-sell-to-huawei-says-commerce-secretary-ross.html,"A man walking past a Huawei P20 smartphone advertisement is reflected in a glass door in front of a Huawei logo, at a shopping mall in Shanghai, China December 6, 2018.

The U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell American-made goods to China's Huawei where there is no threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday, but left key questions unanswered about what products will pass muster.

Seeking to revive trade talks with China, U.S. President Donald Trump announced late last month that American companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.

Trump's comments came after the United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.

While American chipmakers welcomed Trump's announcement, many industry and government officials were confused about the new policy.

Speaking at an annual department conference in Washington, Ross affirmed that the company would remain on the Entity List, which meant licenses would likely be denied and that the new policy would not change the scope of items requiring licenses. However, he also said there would be some approvals.

""To implement the president's G20 summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,"" Ross said, referring to Trump's announcement at the meeting of world leaders in Japan.

""Within those confines, we will try to make sure that we don't just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms,"" he said.

After Huawei was added to the Entity List, the semiconductor industry lobbied the U.S. government for carve-outs to sell nonsensitive items that Huawei could easily buy abroad, arguing that a blanket ban would harm American companies.

On Tuesday, industry observers said Ross's comments lacked the clarity and relief many hoped for after Trump's announcement.

""The actual policy of what is not going to endanger U.S. security is not clear,"" Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said. ""The only way that industry can determine the line is by submitting (license) applications and knowing what types will be approved and which types will be denied.""

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."
Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers,https://www.accuweather.com,[],,,,https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/why-the-latest-usda-report-offers-little-good-news-for-farmers/70008768,"July 08, 2019 Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer July 08, 2019, 4:42:51 PM EDT



The latest Crop Progress from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offered little comfort to U.S. farmers dealing with a difficult planting season. For the fourth straight week, the condition of corn and soybeans was rated below 60%.

The rain and flooding that has impacted Corn Belt farmers has affected the percentage of corn considered “good” or “excellent” in 18 key corn-producing states. That number this week is 57%; the first rating of the season was 59%, followed by consecutive weeks at 56%. The condition of corn rated “good” or “excellent” last year at this time was 75%.

The condition of soybeans in 18 soybean-producing states considered “good” or “excellent” is 53%, compared to 54% last week. That figure was at 71% this time last year.

The bad news continues for Illinois, which is joined by Iowa as the top corn-producing states, typically accounting for about one-third of the U.S. crop, according to the USDA. The condition of corn in Illinois rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is just 37%, even lower than last week’s rating of 42%.

Other states with particularly poor corn condition data this week include Missouri (28%), Ohio (34%) and Indiana (38%). Those three states also had low percentages for the condition of soybeans, too: Ohio (28%), Missouri (35%) and Indiana (37%).

Next week’s numbers may not be much better.

“The weather overall for the heart of the Midwest for the next 10 days is slightly negative,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “There’s not a whole lot of rain, but the temperatures will be favorable because it will be somewhat warmer than normal. It does look like they’ll get some helpful rains later next week.”

A new AccuWeather analysis predicts there will be 13.03 billion bushels of corn produced this year. That would be the lowest total since 2012 when 10.76 billion bushels of corn were harvested. In 2018, the total was 14.42 billion bushels.

The USDA’s 2019 corn production estimate as of June 28 is higher, at 13.88 billion bushels.

""There is no impeachment team,"" Jay Sekulow, who has represented the president from the early days of his administration, told ABC News' ""The Investigation"" podcast. ""I just don't see this as a real threat.""

Sekulow said calls for impeachment by Democrats were simply ""political theater.""

Although pro-impeachment Democrats face an uphill battle from party leadership, they are likely to get another chance to ratchet up support in the public arena when special counsel Robert Mueller appears for open hearings before two House committees next week.

Sekulow told ABC News that his team is not concerned about Mueller's testimony.

""I do not expect that he will deviate at all from [his report], nor do I expect that he will go into anything extemporaneous or extraneous from this,"" Sekulow said. ""I think he's going to stick to the report. In that sense, I think it's going to be the great letdown.""

In May, during his only public comments following his investigation, Mueller said his report was his final testimony and that he would not share information beyond what was written in the report during his public testimony.

But even though impeachment is not Sekulow's main focus, his team is working to defend the president from several inquiries currently playing out in court.

Most recently, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit against the Department of Treasury to gain access to Trump's tax returns. The committee subpoenaed these records from the department in May, but the Treasury Department has resisted turning over the records, arguing that the committee lacks a ""legitimate legislative purpose"" for requesting them.

""We will be intervening in that lawsuit on behalf of the president,"" Sekulow said, adding that he anticipates the case making it to the Supreme Court.

The president's tax returns are also still under audit, according to Sekulow.

""I won't disclose the context of the nature of the audit because that would be disclosing attorney-client privilege,"" Sekulow said. ""But what I am going to tell you is that there is an ongoing audit.""

The president has said the main reason he has not released his tax returns is because of this ongoing audit. The IRS has previously declined to comment on the matter.

Outside of the Mueller probe and battle for the president's tax returns, Sekulow said his role has expanded to managing other cases involving the president an his family, including cases from the Washington D.C. District Court, the Southern District of New York and the New York State Attorney General's Office. The president, his foundation, his personal business and his family remain under legal scrutiny in these districts. Attorneys for the president have argued that many of these cases, including the New York attorney general's investigation into Trump's foundation, are ""politically biased.""

Trump's legal team has been in frequent flux since the start of his presidency, but Sekulow has remained a constant figure.

He attributes his staying power to his years spent playing drums.

""I think part of the success here is having the right tempo,"" Sekulow said. ""So I think I stayed in the groove, so to speak."""
"Homeland Security requests 1,000 additional troops at border",https://nypost.com,['July'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/08/homeland-security-requests-1000-additional-troops-at-border/,"The Trump administration wants to send 1,000 more troops to the US-Mexico border “to provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support” to Border Patrol agents, officials said Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security made the request last week and is waiting to get approval from the Pentagon, according to an agency spokesperson.

DHS officials are looking to send troops from the Texas National Guard.

“Governor Abbott has consented to the use of the National Guard to support CBP,” said the DoD spokesperson in a statement.

“Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,” the statement added. “These holding facilities house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. These holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.”

The additional 1,000 National Guard members would be a major boost to President Trump’s policing of the US southern border. There were already 6,000 troops in the region as of April — 2,100 of whom were members of the Guard, The Hill reports.

Trump has gotten criticized recently over the conditions at federal detention centers along the border, with Democratic lawmakers calling them terrible and “disgusting.”

The president has denied the accusations.

Vice President Mike Pence is planning to travel to the border town of McAllen, Texas, with a bipartisan delegation later this week."
Britain's ambassador is right: Trump’s diplomacy is awful,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/britains-ambassador-is-right-trumps-diplomacy-is-awful,"My colleague Tom Rogan is right that the British government should recall its ambassador to the United States. But that doesn’t mean the ambassador’s leaked assessment of President Trump’s diplomacy was wrong.

In appropriately candid internal memos secured by the Daily Mail, Ambassador Kim Darroch described Trump as “inept,” “incompetent,” and “insecure.” He would also have been right to say that even to Trump’s own underlings, the president’s spasmodic diplomatic moods often must appear incomprehensible, injudicious, and irresponsible.

According to Darroch, the situation is unlikely to improve: “We don't really believe this Administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.”

Now, let it first be said that the publication of what was meant as secure communications has unquestionably made Darroch’s job untenable. As Rogan wrote, “Britain simply cannot afford to alienate the leader of its closest ally.”

Conversely, Trump himself has done plenty to alienate our closest ally, Great Britain. He has repeatedly, directly insulted its (outgoing) prime minister, Theresa May, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. (With Khan, at least Trump was returning fire, but the president of the United States still should not stoop to that level.) Trump has often tried to interfere with internal British politics, has repeatedly claimed without evidence that the British government spied on his campaign, and has threatened trade punishment against Great Britain even though those threats made it tougher for the British to achieve Brexit, which Trump supports.

Those, however, are hardly the only reasons Ambassador Darroch might have assessed the Trump administration so harshly. If Trump’s Cabinet and aides had not intervened to reverse Trump’s original policy pronouncements, Trump would have moved closer to renouncing the central provision of the entire NATO alliance, would have withdrawn American advisers from Syria before gains against ISIS were consolidated, and would have “closed” the Mexican-American border to all trade and travel.

Another time, one of his policy reversals went in the wrong direction, despite his aides’ apparent advice, as he unwisely withdrew harsher sanctions about to be imposed against North Korea.

Trump’s bizarre kowtowing to dictators, especially to Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s horrible Kim Jong Un, has done tremendous damage to U.S. moral standing. His pathetic attempts to provide cover for the murderous Saudi crown prince were cringe-inducing. His saber-rattling against the evil regime in Venezuela achieved nothing, leaving the United States with egg on its face and leaving the poor people of Venezuela still in agony. His trade wars are hurting the global economy in ways that could well reverberate back onto the United States.

And Trump’s zig-zagging on how to penalize Iran, although well intentioned, leaves that situation volatile, with no obvious gains yet for U.S. interests or world peace.

Darroch was perhaps most concerned by Trump’s apparent inability to provide any clear guidance for his advisers: “The stories about White House knife fights are, we judge, mostly true: multiple sources and confirmed by our own White House contacts. This is a uniquely dysfunctional environment.”

In a genuine crisis, the dysfunction within the Trump administration and even within Trump’s own alternating inclinations and whims could be deadly. For example, a propensity to order military strikes, only to call them off with only 10 minutes to spare, is hardly a cause for confidence. Major wars can start over mere accidents.

Darroch didn’t use the following words, but the import of his memos could be summed up thus: Donald Trump’s undiplomatic “diplomacy” is a menace to international safety and stability. If that’s what Darroch really meant, the ambassador was right."
Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452066-environmental-groups-fight-epas-new-public-records-restrictions,"A coalition of environmental groups pushed back Monday against a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that could restrict access to public records.

The new EPA rule, the details of which were first reported by The Hill, allows the administrator and other political appointees to review all materials requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”

The groups that signed the letter, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and many others, have asked Wheeler to withdraw the rule, saying it would be improper to implement it without giving the public a chance to weigh in on its impacts.

EPA’s new rule is similar to the controversial process employed by the Department of the Interior, which also lets political appointees review FOIA requests before they are released to the requester.

Critics of the rule at EPA and Interior have highlighted the potential for abuse.

“Aside from this requirement intuitively granting political staff heightened opportunities to interfere with FOIA requests, it is difficult to see how this change could possibly improve the Agency’s FOIA efficiency or enhance the public’s lawful access to information,” the groups wrote in their Monday letter.

There is already talk in Congress of using legislation to limit the review of public records documents by non-FOIA staff, something the agencies refer to as an “awareness review.”

“Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access,” Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyGraham open to investigating Acosta-Epstein plea deal Taxpayer advocate heading to greener pastures GOP senators decline to criticize Acosta after new Epstein charges MORE (R-Iowa) said in a late June speech on the Senate floor.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”

Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyKatherine Clark quietly eyes leadership ascent Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule UN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty MORE (D-Mass.) is also considering legislation in response to the new rules.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” an EPA spokesman said last month.

In Monday’s letter, the groups contend that holding back documents from a FOIA request is illegal.

“The law is clear that FOIA does not permit agencies to withhold a record or a portion of a record “on the basis of responsiveness,” they wrote.

EPA and Interior have said the FOIA rules are a necessary update to congressional changes to the FOIA law in 2016.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights when the rule was first unveiled in late June. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” the EPA said in a statement when it first announced the rule change."
Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'George Will', 'John Fund', 'David French', 'Deroy Murdock', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Daniel Payne', 'Alexandra Desanctis', 'Madeleine Kearns']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-department-of-education-is-not-a-national-school-board/,"(Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
Obama-era DHS secretary hits 2020 Dem candidates for 'extreme' and 'unworkable' immigration ideas,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-era-dhs-secretary-hits-2020-dem-candidates-for-extreme-and-unworkable-immigration-ideas,"Jeh Johnson, who served as former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security secretary, called out Democratic presidential candidates for embracing ""extreme"" policies on immigration, like rejecting the deportation of those here illegally and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths.

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
U.S. refiners urge EPA to keep biofuel waiver requests secret from USDA,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuel-refineries/u-s-refiners-urge-epa-to-keep-biofuel-waiver-requests-secret-from-usda-idUSKCN1U4244,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A law firm representing small U.S. refineries has urged the Environmental Protection Agency to keep refiners’ applications for waivers from the nation’s biofuel policy secret from the Department of Agriculture, arguing that the petitions include confidential business information.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo

The request, made by Perkins Coie in a letter to the EPA dated July 8, adds to mounting pressure from representatives of the refining industry for the Trump administration to box the USDA out of the controversial waiver program.

The letter follows Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue publicly expressing opposition to the way the program has been run in recent years.

The program can exempt small refiners in financial turmoil from their responsibility to blend ethanol into gasoline under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Waivers can save them tens of millions of dollars but are broadly opposed by the corn industry, which argues they undercut biofuel demand.

Since President Donald Trump took office, the EPA has roughly tripled the number of waivers it has granted to small refiners, drawing anger from the corn lobby and putting Trump in the middle of a battle between two powerful constituencies important to his re-election campaign.

In the letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, Perkins Coie said the applications contained confidential business information (CBI) that should not be shared with the USDA.

“The USDA seeks the small refineries’ CBI in order to assert influence over EPA’s final decisions and thereby reduce the number of small refinery petitions granted by EPA. This interference is improper as a matter of law,” it said.

The letter added that refiners feared the USDA would share the confidential information in the applications with players in the agriculture community, which could undermine the refineries’ ability to compete.

“We would view any release of CBI to USDA as an indication that USDA was given improper influence over the decision-making process for small refinery hardship relief,” the letter said.

Last week, Republican senators representing oil states wrote to Trump asking him to keep Perdue away from any decision-making process over the petitions. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also wrote to Perdue saying he will block confirmation of agency nominations until Perdue “stops interfering.”

Perdue has often sided publicly with farmers on the issue of biofuel waivers and told farmers at an event in Iowa recently that he had spoken to Trump about it and was helping to devise a fix. Trump has also ordered a review of the small refinery waiver program after hearing criticism from farmers during a recent tour of farm country."
New Human Rights Panel Raises Fears of a Narrowing U.S. Advocacy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Eileen Sullivan']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/state-human-rights.html,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that he was installing a human rights advisory panel in the State Department, and named a conservative law professor as its chairwoman, to review and tighten the agency’s definition of human rights and ensure it is grounded in the “nation’s founding principles” and a 1948 United Nations declaration.

The State Department already houses an internal bureau that oversees human rights issues. But the new panel, which Mr. Pompeo said would examine “the role of human rights in American foreign policy,” will not be managed by the bureau and was created without substantial input from its experts and officials.

“International institutions designed and built to protect human rights have drifted from their original mission,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect.”

The announcement, along with a blunt commentary by Mr. Pompeo that was published in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, raised worries among human rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Pompeo is moving to curtail State Department advocacy for some rights, particularly ones related to women’s health and reproduction and gay and transgender issues."
Department of Justice is reportedly planning to replace in-person interpreters with informative videos at immigration hearings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Lauren Frias'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-officials-replace-human-interpreters-with-videos-at-immigration-hearings-2019-7,"The Department of Justice is planning to replace human interpreters at immigration court hearings with informative videos briefing migrants facing deportation on their rights, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The DOJ introduced the switch to immigration judges across the US last month, calling it a ""cost-saving measure"" for a bogged-down immigration court system, according to The Chronicle. The plan could be implemented as early as mid-July.

The video was proposed as a solution to the issue of ""master calendar"" hearings, where immigration judges meet with dozens of undocumented immigrants in ""rapid succession"" to inform them of their rights and obligations and schedule cases, the number of which is close to reaching one million, according to The Chronicle.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department told INSIDER that there is no specific policy change for using informative videos for ""master calendar"" hearings, which typically only last 10 to 15 minutes. Rather, the shift away from in-person interpreters is ""part of an effort to be good stewards"" of the limited resources of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The video, which would be recorded in multiple languages, would serve a similar purpose: informing immigrants on their rights and the course of the court proceedings. Telephone services will also be used for on-demand translation to migrants, when available.

Some judges and immigration advocates, however, are concerned about the videos.

""It's a disaster in the making,"" one judge told the Chronicle, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have approval to talk publicly. ""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate? You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?""

Los Angeles judge Ashley Tabaddor, who is also union president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told the Chronicle that she believed budget concerns don't justify the shift away from human personnel.

""Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost; it's an integral part of every case,"" Tabaddor said to the Chronicle. ""If they actually look at the [immigration] courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters.""

Jeffrey Chase, a former immigration judge, said to The Chronicle that he believes the lack of human interpreters could discourage trust in the court system. Chase, who now volunteers for organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants, is also concerned about due process for immigrants.

""There's no longer concern about the balance,"" he said. ""It's totally efficiency-heavy these days, and I think it's being decided by people who haven't been in the court much and don't understand the consequences."""
DOJ inspector general: DEA supervisor had improper relationship with confidential source,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-dea-supervisor-had-improper-relationship-with-confidential-source,"The Justice Department’s watchdog revealed that a group supervisor with the Drug Enforcement Administration had an “inappropriate relationship” with a DEA confidential source, used a government vehicle to take the source out on dates, shared nonpublic information with the source, made unjustified payments to them, and lied about it.

The DOJ’s Office of Inspector General, led by Michael Horowitz, released the summary on Monday. The probe concluded that the DEA group supervisor “violated DEA policy” by “repeatedly meeting with the CS alone,” including at the source’s home. The inquiry also found that the group supervisor “went on two personal trips” with the source and let the source visit the group supervisor’s family and friends.

“None of these individuals were made aware that the group supervisor’s companion was a DEA confidential source who was participating in drug trafficking investigations involving violent criminals,” the DOJ inspector general wrote. “In so doing, the group supervisor deceived these individuals and exposed them and their families to potential danger.”

DOJ’s watchdog also concluded that the DEA assistant special agent in charge signed off on improper payments and failed to properly manage the group supervisor.

The report said “criminal prosecution was declined” by the Justice Department.

Horowitz’s investigation into alleged FISA abuse has reportedly concluded, although last-minute witnesses and a tricky classification process mean it may be a while until the report is released."
DHS Official Defends Conditions at Border Patrol Stations,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/07/08/dhs-official-defends-conditions-at-border-patrol-stations/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday defended conditions at U.S. Border Patrol stations following reports of crowded and unsanitary conditions that have heightened debate about President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, a trademark issue for his reelection campaign.

“It’s an extraordinarily challenging situation,” McAleenan told ABC’s “This Week.”

The Homeland Security Department’s internal watchdog provided new details about the overcrowding in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The report said children at three facilities had no access to showers and that some children under age 7 had been held in jammed centers for more than two weeks. Some cells were so cramped that adults were forced to stand for days on end.

Government inspectors described an increasingly dangerous situation, both for migrants and agents — a “ticking time bomb,” in the words of one facility manager. The report echoed findings in May by the department’s inspector general about holding centers in El Paso, Texas: 900 people crammed into a cell with a maximum capacity of 125; detainees standing on toilets to have room to breathe; others wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks.

In tweets, Trump went further than McAleenan in defending his administration’s response, accusing the news media of “phony and exaggerated accounts” but without providing evidence.

“Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job. We said there was a Crisis – the Fake News & the Dems said it was ‘manufactured,'” Trump wrote. Federal detention centers “are crowded (which we … brought up, not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!”

Democrats faulted Trump for not offering an immigration overhaul that could pass a divided Congress.

“The president is acting like we are some weak, pathetic country,” said Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democratic presidential candidate. “We have the ability to treat human beings humanely. We have the ability to lead our hemisphere in a discussion about how to deal with this refugee crisis,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

McAleenan said that since the first of the year, 200 medical providers have been added to facilities, including personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Public Health Service Commission Corps.

“We have pediatricians in border patrol stations for the first time in history trying to help address conditions where children are coming across 300 a day in … April and May,” McAleenan said.

“We’ve built soft-sided temporary facilities. These are spaces that are much more appropriate — high ceilings, more room for children and families. We’ve put them both in Donna, Texas, in South Texas as well as in El Paso to provide additional space. … We’ve bought buses to transport people to better places.”

McAleenan disputed news reports, including those by The Associated Press, of especially troubling conditions at a border station in Clint, Texas, where a stench was coming from children’s clothing and some detainees were suffering from scabies and chickenpox.

“There’s adequate food and water,” he said. “The facility’s cleaned every day, because I know what our standards are and I know they’re been followed because we have tremendous levels of oversight. Five levels of oversight.

“Inadequate food, inadequate water and unclean cells. None of those have been substantiated.”

He said everyone in the chain of command is worried about the situation of children detained at the border. He said that on June 1, his department had 2,500 children in custody, including 1,200 who had been there for more than three days. As of Saturday, McAleenan said there were 350 children, and only 20 have been in the department’s custody for more than three days.

“So that’s huge improvement based on the resources we asked for from Congress and were finally given,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he is stunned when administration officials say that reports on the conditions are unsubstantiated.

“I’m just like, ‘What world are they living in?'” Merkley said, citing government and news reports. “From every direction you see that the children are being treated in a horrific manner. And there’s an underlying philosophy that it’s OK to treat refugees in this fashion. And that’s really the rot at the core of the administration’s policy.”

Separately, McAleenan addressed questions about U.S. Border Patrol agents who are under fire for posting offensive messages in a “secret” Facebook group that included sexually explicit posts about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and dismissive references to the deaths of migrants in U.S. custody. The existence of that group was reported Monday by ProPublica. Prior to that, few people outside the group had ever heard of it.

He said an allegation about such activity was investigated in 2016. “Discipline was meted out on an agent that made an offensive post on that website,” he said."
Justice Department files to stop Trump suit demanding financial documents,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-files-to-stop-trump-suit-demanding-financial-documents/,"The Justice Department on Monday challenged a federal judge's decision to allow a case accusing President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency to move forward, asking an appeals court to take up the case instead.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright, calling the case dealing with a Revolutionary War-era clause ""extraordinary.""

The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, which would force Trump-related entities such as his New York and D.C. hotels, Trump Tower, the Trump Organization, and Mar-a-Lago Club to turn over business tax returns, receipts and other documents.

Justice lawyers said in the filings that answering their 37 subpoena requests in the interim, by July 29, would cause Trump ""irreparable injury"" and distract him from his official duties.

This is the second time Justice lawyers have petitioned a higher court to take up a case dealing with the emoluments clause, which bans government officials from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress' permission. Last December, the federal appeals court agreed to hear a similar case out of a Maryland federal court that had also reached such a point. In the meantime, a stay on proceedings was also allowed.

The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who is also chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

""Our goal is simple and straightforward — stopping President Trump from putting a 'For Sale' sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office,"" Blumenthal said in a statement Monday. ""Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.""

The Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.

The filing of a writ of mandamus is considered an ""extraordinary remedy,"" according to the Justice Department's website , which ""should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Among the judges who sit on the appeals court, includes chief judge is Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court was not allowed to be heard by Republicans.

The filing seeking for a writ of mandamus comes two weeks after Sullivan ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings. For Justice to succeed at the appeals level, they must meet a demanding standard that would partly rest on showing Sullivan's decisions to be clearly wrong and that there's no adequate alternative for relief in the case.

They have argued that the court has ignored ""unique separation-of-powers concerns"" involved in having members of one branch of government conducting discovery against the president in his official capacity. The government also wrote in their filing that the legislature itself must bring such a case, ""not an amalgam of individual legislators or even a single chamber of a bicameral body.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The District of Columbia case is one of three that argues the president is violating the emoluments clause, but this case is notable because the plaintiffs in this suit — members of Congress — are mentioned in the clause itself. The Democrats' attorneys have argued that Congress not only has a right but is required, as part of their jobs, to weigh in on potential emoluments to Trump such as a $6.5 million condo purchase by the Qatari government or a Chinese-government owned company's investment in a project that will include a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia.

Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the Democrats suing the president are not being injured by him at all but by their colleagues in Congress, who have refused to take up the emoluments issue. And the government has contended that Trump's business activity such as hotel room earnings don't qualify under the constitutional definition of emoluments.

Blumenthal said the subpoenas seeking information in the case are ""targeted"" to get information that ensures the president isn't avoiding his constitutional responsibility to ask Congress to approve any emoluments. The aim of the subpoenas is to trace ownership interests and money flowing to Trump from foreign governments and their representatives.

The subpoenas were seeking the terms governing the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and related information, and aimed to determine trademarks granted to Trump or his companies by foreign governments since Jan. 20, 2017, and all pending applications for foreign trademarks.

The Justice Department asked the court in its filing Monday for a ruling regarding their request for a stay on the subpoenas by July 22 — one week before the official response deadline — ""in order to provide time to seek relief from the Supreme Court if necessary,"" an indication that the governments attorneys may be willing to elevate the case to the highest court if there is any indication they won't succeed at the appeals court."

New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who's facing charges for soliciting prostitutes, attended a star-studded state dinner in honor of Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the Treasury Department on Monday night.

Kraft, a longtime friend of President Donald Trump, was seated next to IMF leader and incoming European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde, and was at the same table as Trump and the emir himself.

The dinner, hosted by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, was also attended by White House advisors Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Goldman Sachs executive and former White House official Dina Powell, among other high-profile figures, The New York Times reported.

At the dinner, intended to bolster the US's relationship with the small but extremely wealthy nation of Qatar, Trump joked in his prepared remarks to the emir that the dinner was ""a who's who, Tamim, of business. Even you are impressed, and that's pretty hard. But this really is. This is a great room. Many friends.""

While Kraft is an important business executive and a prominent Trump ally, his presence at the prestigious dinner was particularly notable given the legal controversy Kraft has been embroiled in this year.

On February 14, Kraft and a number of other male business executives— including former Citigroup president John Havens and Republican mega-donor John Childs — were charged with soliciting prostitution at a Jupiter, Florida massage parlor and spa. Kraft has pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges.

After Kraft's arrest was announced, Trump called the events ""very sad,"" adding, ""I was very surprised to see it. He's proclaimed his innocence totally, but I'm very surprised to see it.""

While authorities say they possess surveillance video footage of Kraft and other defendants engaged in the alleged solitication of prostitution, a Florida judge ruled in April to block their release to the media and the public until the cases go to trial or are resolved with plea agreements.

Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reluctant-witnesses-in-fisa-abuse-probe-agree-to-talk-to-doj-inspector-general,"Key witnesses sought for questioning by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."
DoI independently validates DJI Government Edition,https://dronedj.com,"['Dji Mavic Pro Zoom', 'The Best Allround', 'Foldable Drone Money Can Buy.', 'Dji Mavic Air', 'The Latest Foldable Dji Drone With Video', 'Pano Photos']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://dronedj.com/2019/07/09/doi-validates-dji-government-edition/,"It seems that DJI is finally getting a break from concerns that various government agencies have expressed about the security of the data captured by DJI’s drones. After an independent 15-month testing program that included thousands of drone flights with models such as the DJI Mavic Pro and DJI Matrice 600 Pro, the Department of the Interior (DoI) has validated and approved the DJI Government Edition.

When the DoI started testing in April 2018, the newer Mavic 2 Pro, Zoom and Enterprise Edition had not yet hit the market, so were not included in the test. DJI told DroneDJ that testing has not yet started on the newer Mavic 2 drones, as the Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 tests have just been finished.

See DJI’s press statement below for all the details.

DoI validates DJI government edition

U.S. federal agency validates and approves DJI’s high-security solution for government drone programs Department of the Interior Completes Independent 15-Month Testing of DJI Government Edition Solution Using Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 Pro Drones DJI, the world’s leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology, is pleased to announce that its high-security solution for government drone programs, Government Edition, has received independent validation from the U.S. Department of the Interior. The approval was received after a more than 15-month rigorous assessment of the flight, payload, and data management assurance performance of DJI Matrice 600 Pro and Mavic Pro drones equipped with DJI Government Edition firmware and software. “The Department of Interior’s report validates DJI’s effort to build software and hardware solutions that meet the evolving data security needs of its customers,” said Mario Rebello, vice president and regional manager of North America at DJI. “The DOI has a strong track record of leadership within the US government for its ability to pragmatically evaluate and implement drone technology for use across a wide variety of applications. We appreciate their partnership and value the collaborative effort to help create a DJI drone solution that will allow emergency first responders and others to save lives and effectively manage our public lands. We look forward to continuing to support the Department of Interior and other federal agencies with DJI’s industry-leading drone technology.” The DOI’s findings were presented in a flight test and technical evaluation report issued last week*. Key findings of the report included: 1. DOI has been working with DJI for over two years to create a solution that would allow its bureaus access to DJI’s high-quality off-the-shelf hardware equipped with custom firmware and software to prevent intentional or unintentional data leakage to any outside entities. 2. Testing of the DJI Government Edition solution began in April 2018 as part of the three-phase testing plan developed by DOI. 3. Testing included 1,133 flights totaling 298 hours on the DJI Matrice 600 Pro and 1,112 flights totaling 240 hours for the DJI Mavic Pro drones. 4. DOI collaborated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center as well as other industry and federal partners with expertise in data management assurance testing to conduct targeted assessments of DJI Government Edition hardware, firmware, and software. 5. During testing there was no indication that data was being transmitted outside the system, confirming that they were operating as promised by DJI. While DJI customers have full control over how the data they generate with drones is collected, stored and transmitted, DJI Government Edition’s unique architecture ensures that drone data – including photos and videos captured during flight – can never be intentionally or accidentally shared with unauthorized parties. The solution is based on DJI’s industry-leading drone hardware and is controlled by custom device firmware and operational software in a unique architecture that supports high data security requirements: • No Data Transmission — A permanently enabled Local Data Mode within the custom DJI Pilot application prevents users from accidentally or even intentionally transferring data from the mobile application over the internet to third parties or to DJI. • Firmware Reviews — Government agency aviation and IT departments can review firmware updates in electronic isolation before applying them to their fleets, and have full control over how to validate them and when to install them on DJI drones. • Restricted Hardware Pairing — Drones and remote controllers running DJI Government Edition solution firmware can only be linked with each other and are not compatible with other off-the-shelf DJI products, preventing the use of unsecure hardware and unauthorized third-party applications. The DJI Government Edition solution as validated by the DOI, referred to as DJI Government Edition v1.0**, for DJI Matrice 600 Pro and DJI Mavic Pro drones is available for purchase through select authorized DJI Enterprise resellers in the United States.

DHS officials set for grilling over facial recognition tech,https://thehill.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/452282-dhs-officials-set-for-grilling-over-facial-recognition-tech,"Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are set to testify before a House panel on Wednesday about the government’s use of facial recognition as Congress presses toward legislation curtailing the use of the controversial technology.

The hearing comes as lawmakers reel over the release of documents showing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses state driver’s license databases for facial recognition searches without consent from individuals.

Though an ICE representative will not be present at the hearing, a House Homeland Security Committee spokesperson told The Hill the tranche of documents – which revealed the government is scanning millions of Americans’ faces without their permission – is likely to come up.

Representatives with Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), agencies within DHS, will face tough questions about how the department is using the technology increasingly across the U.S.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonCuccinelli: Critics of detention conditions 'complaining about the numbers they're attracting' Top Democrats call for administration to rescind child migrant information sharing policy Democratic lawmaker says officials tried to keep her from migrant girls during facility tour MORE (D-Miss.) in a statement said he believes it is “imperative” that such sensitive technologies “only be used for authorized purposes in a fully transparent manner.”

“Federal agencies – like DHS – must balance their critical security mission with a commitment to safeguard citizens’ civil liberties,” Thompson said. “Before the government deploys these technologies further, they must be fully scrutinized and the American public needs to be given a chance to weigh in.”

Documents released by a top privacy group over the weekend have set off alarm bells for privacy hawks in Congress and outside, providing insight into how ICE and the FBI use state driver’s license databases when searching for suspects in investigations.

According to records obtained by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology and shared with The Hill, ICE has requested facial recognition searches of driver’s license databases in Utah, Vermont, and Washington hundreds of times in total. The queries offer one of the first glimpses into ICE’s use of the controversial biometric tool, which scans people’s faces for the purposes of identifying them.

Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Georgetown privacy center, said it’s likely that ICE is running similar searches in other states.

“If ICE is running face recognition searches in these states, ICE may well be searching driver’s license databases across many of the other ten states (and the District of Columbia) that allow undocumented residents to drive,” Rudolph wrote in a blog post, calling the secretive partnership a “serious betrayal of residents’ trust.”

ICE defended its use of face scanning, saying it tracks with its general approach to prosecution.

“During the course of an investigation, ICE has the ability to collaborate with external local, federal and international agencies to obtain information that may assist in case completion and prosecution efforts,” ICE said in a statement defending the practice. “This is an established procedure that is consistent with other law-enforcement agencies.”

It has also been known for some time that the FBI is one of the top federal agencies using facial recognition capabilities, conducting over 4,000 searches on average per month. The FBI has amassed a database of over 640 million photographs, including 36 million mugshot photos, 21 state driver’s license directories and multiple other sources of information.

Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanHillicon Valley: Critics push FTC to get tough on YouTube | Analysts expect regulatory trouble for Facebook's cryptocurrency | Senators to get election security briefing | FBI, ICE reportedly using driver's license photos for facial recognition FBI, ICE using state driver's license photos without consent for facial recognition searches: report Cities lead crackdown on facial recognition tech MORE (R-Ohio), an increasingly vocal surveillance critic and the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said during an interview with NPR on Tuesday morning. “You have that fundamental concern coupled with the fundamental First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, due process concerns that I think we all share.”

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said this year they are working to come up with legislative solutions to the rapid rise of facial recognition tech across the country, which they say raises privacy and civil rights concerns. The House Oversight Committee has been at the forefront of the push, holding a series of hearings in which lawmakers on opposite sides of the political spectrum have come together to voice opposition.

Jordan said his office is currently working with top Democrats “to come up with the right kind of legislation.”

On Wednesday, the House Homeland Security Committee will jump into the debate as members press the witnesses over one of the most controversial government uses of the technology -- its implementation in airports.

Officials with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), agencies within DHS, will testify about their efforts to implement an expansive face scanning program in airports, a plan that has drawn significant ire from Capitol Hill.

Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersTrump reversal on Huawei gets bipartisan pushback Hillicon Valley: White House to host social media summit amid Trump attacks | Pelosi says Congress to get election security briefing in July | Senate GOP blocks election security bill | Pro-Trump forum 'quarantined' by Reddit | Democrats press Zuckerberg White House to convene social media summit after new Trump attacks MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the committee, is set to focus on that program, highlighting the ""current and potential uses of biometrics to improve security, facilitate travel and enforce our immigration laws,"" a Rogers spokeswoman told The Hill. Rogers plans to spotlight the improvements CBP has made to its facial recognition program and ask questions about best practices for the technology.

DHS has said it hopes to use facial recognition technology on 97 percent of departing air passengers by 2023, and its face scanning program – dubbed “Biometric Exit” – has been implemented at over a dozen U.S. airports so far.

CBP and TSA are likely to defend the merits of facial recognition technology, which can be used to identify people in the U.S. illegally and speed up the process of getting through the airport. But amid a larger uproar over whether the federal government is overstepping in the technology’s uses, they’re likely to get significant pushback.

“What I hope gets discussed is both the degree to which agencies, especially CBP, have simply really gone ahead using what is in many ways a novel and very dangerous technology without congressional authorization, without getting anyone’s approval,” Jake Laperruque, senior counsel with the Project on Government Insight, told The Hill in a phone interview.

The various federal agencies use facial recognition technology for different purposes – the FBI and ICE say they only tap their face scanning capabilities during criminal investigations, while CBP and TSA are leading the effort to implement the technology in airports and at the border.

But any legislative solution is likely to rein in all of those uses as public sentiment grows increasingly wary of the technology.

Top digital rights group Fight for the Future on Tuesday launched a campaign to impose a total federal ban on the government’s use of facial recognition technology, as other privacy groups press for a temporary pause or stricter regulation.

“Our position is that this technology is simply too dangerous to be used for government surveillance,” Fight for the Future said in a statement. “It falls into a category with nuclear and biological weapons, where the potential harms to human society far outweigh any potential benefits. That's why we're calling for an outright ban.” The group asking its supporters to raise their concerns with Congress.

Jordan during the Tuesday interview said he’s not sure if lawmakers are planning to call for an all-out ban or a pause on the technology.

“Whether it's an all-out ban or not, I don't know,” Jordan said. “Whether it's a time-out, I don't know. But the good news is we're working together, and this is one of those few areas where we've been able to find some common ground.”"

Trump's EPA stands up for consumers and freedom by standing up to the ethanol lobby,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/trumps-epa-stands-up-for-consumers-and-freedom-by-standing-up-to-the-ethanol-lobby,"President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency took a step toward draining the swamp by curbing the amount of corn ethanol being forced into our economy by the crony capitalist ethanol mandate.

Big Corn is exploding with shock and dismay, as are corn-friendly lawmakers. But the White House shouldn’t heed the objections of these subsidized corporate moonshiners. Instead, he should lean on Congress to go further and reduce the ethanol mandate to zero.

Ethanol is a fuel alcohol derived from plants, in this country mostly from corn. Without federal support, there would be a very small market for ethanol, which is less powerful than gasoline, typically more expensive, cannot be shipped by pipeline, and tends to corrode engines.

The federal renewable fuel standard, also known as the RFS and the ethanol mandate, is King Corn’s current gravy train. The mandate requires refineries to blend a certain amount of ethanol into their gasoline. The EPA has some leeway on this score, and the agency has used it to protect consumers rather than the ethanol lobby.

The fuel standard requires at least 15 billion gallons of “conventional biofuels,” basically corn ethanol, for 2020. The ethanol lobby wanted the Trump administration to require more ethanol than even the law requires. Trump’s EPA further infuriated the industry by issuing exemptions for small refineries, which often struggle to get their hands on the amounts of ethanol required to meet the mandates.

The corn lobby angrily denounces these exemptions as “small refinery bailouts,” in the words of Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Consider for a moment the perverse sense of entitlement here. An organization representing for-profit businesses, firms engaged in enterprise and supposedly proud of their product, calls it a ""bailout"" when a potential customer is granted limited freedom to not buy their product.

This is how crony capitalism not only distorts the economy and corrupts our politics (watch the Democratic presidential candidates bow before the altar of ethanol in Iowa these days), but how it also corrupts our businesses.

We understand that some of ethanol's biggest champions are powerful. We understand that Trump's political allies include some ethanol hustlers. And we understand the desire to help farmers, especially at a moment when tariffs are unfairly hurting them.

But if Trump cares about the economy, and about draining the swamp, he will not give into King Corn's demands. In fact, he should go in the other direction.

Trump should call on his friends in Congress to kill the ethanol mandate. Pass and sign a law winding the mandate down from its 15 billion gallons down to zero gallons in 2025. At the same time, scrap the mandate for ""advanced"" biofuels. If these fuels are so great, then consumers will buy them without a mandate.

That's how capitalism works, even if the swamp wants it to work differently."
