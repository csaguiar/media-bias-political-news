Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"Xi Jinping Arrives in North Korea, With Many Eyes on Trump",https://www.nytimes.com,['Jane Perlez'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-north-korea.html,"BEIJING — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, arrived in North Korea’s capital on Thursday to a 21-gun salute at the airport, the release of thousands of balloons and crowds lining the streets, as his car wound its way to the mausoleum where the North’s founder lies.

The elaborate ceremonial welcome for Mr. Xi, making his first visit to the North since taking power seven years ago, seemed designed as an upbeat makeover of what has been a dour relationship between him and the North’s young leader, Kim Jong-un.

The two are engaged in separate disputes with President Trump — one over trade, the other over the North’s nuclear weapons. American officials have said they expect Mr. Xi to try to make headway with Mr. Kim on the nuclear issue, then use that as leverage with Mr. Trump on trade next week, when the two are expected to meet in Japan.

[Here’s what to watch for as Mr. Xi visits North Korea.]

Such expectations grew on Wednesday when a rare article by Mr. Xi appeared in the North Korean ruling party’s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. He wrote that China was willing to draw up a “grand plan” with the North that would “realize permanent peace” on the Korean Peninsula."

The two were discussing what appeared to be a sore subject for Behar — Trump's enormous crowd size. The frequent Trump critic downplayed the massive attendance at his re-election announcement rally on Tuesday and suggested that his fans hated both immigrants and black people.

After ""The View"" played a clip of Trump's speech, Behar said seemed to compare Trump to a ""jukebox"" — referring to how the audience predictably responded to things the president said. ""D3 – lock her up! D4 – the press is the enemy,"" she said, mocking the president. Behar also questioned why audience members were effectively telling Trump, ""Lie to me, lie to me.""

'THE VIEW' CO-HOSTS PUSH BACK ON BIDEN'S CLAIM HE CAN COMPROMISE WITH GOP

""What's wrong with them?"" she asked. McCain, however, touted Trump's crowd size and prompted Behar to interject multiple times — claiming Trump's supporters were ""bused"" in, there would ""always"" be that many people at rallies, and suggesting that a Democratic candidate would soon enjoy the type of crowd size that Trump had.

Trump's crowd drew in an estimated 20,000 people — much larger than the 14,000 that former President Barack Obama drew for his re-election announcement in 2012. Many of the attendees even arrived 40 hours in advance to get into the rally.

""OK!"" McCain exclaimed after Behar interrupted multiple times. ""But it did happen. It's not fake news.""

McCain seemed to touch a nerve again when she told viewers not to ""belittle"" Trump's crowds. ""Sometimes it's not just that they love Trump so much, it's that they hate the same things that Trump's hates,"" McCain added.

""Who? Black people, you mean? Or immigrants?"" Behar asked. McCain told Behar that she realized she was angry but that ""yelling"" wasn't going to help the situation. The conversation intensified as Behar seemed to ask the audience whether she was yelling at McCain.

""Yes!"" McCain exclaimed, before telling her that the 2020 presidential election was not ""in the bag"" for Democrats.

Goldberg, who initially tried to intervene at a lower tone, had to shout over the two in order to stop the conversation. ""OK, guys! OK!"" Goldberg said. ""It's a great discussion and we can go back to it. I just need everybody to take a beat.""

At the end of the discussion, McCain appeared to say ""Don't feel bad for me, b***h,"" after Behar responded to her comment about being the ""sacrificial Republican"" on the show."

Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testifying behind closed doors,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kaitlan Collins', 'Kevin Liptak']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/trump-hope-hicks-relationship/index.html,"Once the President's closest West Wing confidante -- the recipient of his repeated phone calls, the witness to his angriest moments, and according to other campaign aides, the person who steamed wrinkles out of his pants -- sources now say their relationship has changed. Instead of carrying out a near-constant conversation, they rarely speak.

Hicks returns to Washington on Wednesday to testify behind closed doors before the House Judiciary Committee for its investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the President. This account is based on interviews with several current and former administration officials, as well as people close to Trump and Hicks.

The once-close pair's communication first slowed, then came to a virtual halt, after she left the White House. She told those around her that it wasn't a representation of her feelings toward the man she worked for, but a desire to distance herself from the orbit she had occupied for so long: his. There were several times when she didn't return Trump's call. According to two people familiar with his remark, Trump asked on multiple occasions, ""What happened to Hope?""

People close to Hicks say that, despite her distance, she remains on the President's side. She has kept in close contact with White House and Trump campaign officials, who send her updates from the West Wing and the trail or call for advice on dealing with the mercurial President she built a close relationship with.

But Hicks is returning to a different Washington Wednesday than the one she occupied more than a year ago. Democrats now control the House, and have launched an onslaught of investigations into the president and his administration. Now they will have one of the President's most trusted advisers on their turf. In their first interview with a former White House official since Trump vowed to ""fight all the subpoenas,"" Democrats want to probe Hicks on everything from James Comey's firing to Trump's demands that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions un-recuse himself.

Hicks joins a long list of current and former Trump aides called to appear before lawmakers intent on probing Trump's attempts to short-circuit the investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller. While some of those staffers were privy to key moments and critical decisions over the course of Trump's campaign and presidency, perhaps no other staffer has the potential to offer Democrats as much insight into Trump's thinking and mindset than Hicks.

An original who left the fold

A onetime model and public relations professional, Hicks joined Trump's presidential campaign early and remained one of the few aides to follow him from his political beginnings to the White House. She maintained a close relationship not just with the President -- who called her ""Hopey"" -- but with members of his family, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, both senior advisers.

She carried out that role barely uttering a single word in public -- no television interviews and only a few scattered appearances at microphones alongside Trump.

Hicks stepped down from her role as White House communications director and left the administration last March. She moved out of her luxe Washington apartment and relocated to Manhattan, where she kept a low profile for the next several months and kept in touch with her former White House colleagues.

At times, she contemplated returning to the administration, quizzing friends last summer about what position she could have if she made a comeback. She was even spotted boarding Air Force One last August ahead of the President's campaign rally in Ohio -- a spur-of-the-moment return to presidential travel after visiting with her former colleagues at Trump's New Jersey golf club.

But mostly, people who spoke to Hicks said she was trying to adjust after three years in Trump's orbit, a whirlwind that saw both her and the President go from political novices to running the country.

Seven months after her departure, the Fox corporation announced it had hired Hicks to become the company's chief communications officer, where she would be based in Los Angeles. Since moving to the West Coast, Hicks, a Connecticut native, has been spotted in upscale restaurants, at yoga studios, and -- based on those who know her -- living a relatively unassuming life, aware that she carries the echo of a polarizing president.

But several sources with knowledge of their relationship said one aspect of her new life is unexpected: Hicks rarely speaks to the President anymore.

A witness to all

People who know the President best say he is an avid caller. He will phone lawmakers, old friends and his staff multiple times a day to quiz them on everything from which Democratic presidential candidates are ahead or to complain about a recent segment he saw on cable news.

But when she worked for him, Trump's call log with Hicks was exorbitant, people close to both of them said. He regularly phoned her more than he did his chief of staff, regardless of who was occupying that title at the time. She rarely left White House grounds during the day because she needed to be within earshot of Trump, who often summoned her at a moment's notice. And if it wasn't Trump on the other end of the phone, it was often another White House staffer or outside adviser inquiring about the President's mood and asking advice on how best to broach an issue with him.

In her tenure as Trump's communications guru, Hicks witnessed some of darkest moments of his presidency. She described in interviews with Mueller's investigators a seething President after the special counsel's appointment, saying she'd only seen him angrier after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that captured him boasting about grabbing women was released.

She also described the President being upset that too many people were aware of emails related to a now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower with Russian officials linked to the Kremlin. In a text message exchange with Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., Hicks detailed her attempts to advise the President on a communications strategy surrounding the meeting.

""I think that's right, too, but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions,"" she wrote when Donald Trump Jr. suggested an edit to a prepared statement.

The White House is asserting immunity to prevent Hicks from testifying Wednesday about her time at the White House, setting up a potential showdown with Democrats when she appears behind closed doors.

But Democrats' on the House Judiciary Committee are also planning to press Hicks on events that occurred before Trump took office, including her knowledge of the hush-money scheme to silence Trump's extramarital affairs in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, a committee aide told CNN."
E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
"Marine general 'bullied' subordinates, 'devalued women': Pentagon inspector general",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marine-general-bullied-subordinates-devalued-women-pentagon-inspector/story?id=63814450,"A Department of Defense Inspector General report concluded that a Marine Corps general ""disparaged, bullied, and humiliated subordinates, devalued women, and created a negative ... work environment that led to a general distrust of his impartiality and leadership.""

In response, the Marine Corps said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was serving as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps when the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a complaint to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis about Cooling's conduct, leading to the DOD IG investigation which was initiated on March 15, 2018.

The IG concluded that Cooling violated sections of U.S. Code, as well as Defense Department and Navy regulations. He is currently serving as the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies and Operations for the Marine Corps, after being removed from his previous position last year due to the investigation.

United States Marine Corps

After reviewing the IG's draft report, Cooling acknowledged that he ""fell short of maintaining a positive climate throughout the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)"" and accepted responsibility for that shortfall, but said the report did not provide ""sufficient evidence by any legitimate legal standard to support a finding that I created a hostile work environment or that I made demeaning remarks about women,"" according to the IG.

""The Marine Corps takes all allegations of misconduct seriously, regardless of rank,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Brian Block told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Marine Corps is currently reviewing the DoD IG's report and will take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian -- and particularly those in leadership positions -- to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct. When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable,"" he said.

Sgt. Joseph Johnson/U.S. Department of Defense

The IG interviewed over three dozen witnesses and reviewed 11,650 official emails, along with other relevant documents before determining, according to the report, that ""on numerous occasions ... Cooling’s comments and conduct demeaned, bullied, and humiliated his subordinates.""

Among the details of the report:

""BGen Cooling told a female [non commissioned officer] who aspires to be a Marine Corps pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a brothel than be a pilot.""

""He loudly and publicly berated two staff members whom he accused of trying to 'f**k' him and asked them repeatedly, 'Where the f**k have you been?'""

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

""In a staff meeting, he bullied a staff officer when he publicly berated, belittled, and singled her out for ridicule in front of her peers when a Member of Congress canceled a meeting with the Assistant Commandant. He then told his entire staff in the same meeting that if any of them failed to get an office call for the Assistant Commandant with a Member of Congress, he was 'going to jump out this f**king window.'""

""He bullied a subordinate when he attempted to damage her reputation by spreading a rumor about her and potentially damaging her future career by warning the most senior Marine Corps officer in the subordinate’s career field, 'watch yourself, you’ve got to watch out' for her. BGen Cooling further blamed the subordinate for the SASC complaint against him, his removal from the Legislative Assistant position, and this investigation into his conduct.""

Cooling further told the IG that the report ""can only legitimately establish that I made a few isolated comments that some construed in the worst possible way and told third parties so that they ended up in the [SASC complaint].""

""At no time during that brief assignment, nor at any other time during my career, did I ever discriminate against anyone for anything other than their performance,"" he said in the report.

Cooling graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986 and has deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his military career."
Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/schiff-doj-campaign-spying-probe-1370713,"House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Justice Department investigations into the origins of the Russia probe were part of an effort to ""ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election."" | Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo congress Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe Attorney General Bill Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign.

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"

Sater worked with President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on a Trump Tower deal in Moscow before the 2016 election. The project was later abandoned.

Hope Hicks has concluded her closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee.

President Donald Trump’s former aide testified over eight hours Wednesday as part of the panel’s investigation of the president, Russian election interference and obstruction of justice. It was the first time the committee has heard from someone linked to Trump’s inner circle since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

It is unclear how much new information, if any, she provided in the second-floor hearing room where she met with the panel and staff. Lawmakers say she was answering questions about the Trump campaign.

But lawyers objected to Hicks answering questions about the Trump presidency, citing something they described as “absolute immunity.” Democrats say no such thing exists and vowed to go to court

The interview is part of the panel’s investigation of President Donald Trump and obstruction of justice. Hicks is the first testimony they will hear from someone linked to Trump’s inner circle since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

It is unclear how much information she will provide, as the White House has said she is “absolutely immune” from testimony with respect to her service to the president. A White House lawyer will be in the room.

Hicks did not respond to questions as she made her way through a throng of photographers into the second-floor hearing room.

6:40 a.m.

The closed-door interview that House lawmakers have with Hope Hicks, a former communications director for President Donald Trump, marks the first time they are hearing from someone linked to his inner circle since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

Obtaining the testimony Wednesday from Hicks, a close and trusted former Trump aide, is a significant victory for Democrats.

The House Judiciary Committee originally subpoenaed Hicks to give public testimony, but agreed to the private interview after negotiations.

Still, it is unclear how much new information Hicks will provide.

She already cooperated extensively with Mueller’s probe, and a White House lawyer who will be in the room for the interview is expected to try and block her from answering certain questions."
WV MetroNews Final rule filed on Trump's Affordable Clean Energy plan,http://wvmetronews.com,['Metronews Staff'],06-19-2019,2019,6,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/06/19/coal-industry-reacts-to-new-epa-rule/,"By MetroNews Staff in | June 19, 2019 at 2:02PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. –West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney was cautiously optimistic about the Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy Rule.

File Bill Raney

The measure, announced Wednesday, would gut an Obama-era rule which required U.S. power companies to reduce carbon emissions by 35 percent over their 2005 levels by the year 2030.

“It’s positive for the coal industry for certain because we struggled with the Obama administration and everything they did,” Raney said.

However, it’s unclear just how quickly the new rule would have any noticeable impact on the coal industry or if it will at all.

Many power producers have already shutdown older coal-fired power plants and switched to alternative fuels like natural gas in newer operations to generate electricity. Some companies are already on a glide path to meet the standards which were imposed by the Obama-era rule.

“I think it will be slow and drawn out,” Raney said on MetroNews “Talkline.” “It’s a matter of an obstacle that was placed in front off the utility industry and it’s going to take a while to turn that around.”

In an article published last fall in Sierra, the national magazine for the Sierra Club, New York University School of Law Professor Richard Revesz predicted the change by the Trump administration would not stand up in court.

“The agency has a weak position, in part because the agency acknowledges that their rule will produce tens of billions of dollars of foregone benefits relative to the Clean Power Plan,” Revesz said.

Patrick Morrisey

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey gave credit to President Trump for the new rule.

“President Trump has been a friend of our state, and of coal, and the Affordable Clean Energy rule allows our state the autonomy to regulate energy and air quality without much of the unlawful federal overreach of the so-called Clean Power Plan,” Morrisey said in a statement.

U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito also praised the rule.

“The EPA’s final Affordable Clean Energy rule is another sign that the Trump administration is committed to commonsense regulation and ending the War on Coal, and that striking a balance between the economy and the environment is absolutely possible,” Capito said “The Obama administration’s so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ was an unrealistic and strangling regulation that was devastating to West Virginia’s energy economy.”

Capito said the new rule would allow states and energy producers to reduce emissions at an “achievable pace” without hurting the economy.

“Combined with rolling back unnecessary bureaucratic red tape and compliance costs, this will keep American energy affordable and competitive on the world stage. West Virginians don’t have to choose between a clean environment and a thriving economy. We demand both; and with this plan, we can achieve both,” Capito said.

Senator Joe Manchin, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he pleased fossil fuel plants have more flexibility but addressing climate change should remain a top priority.

“I never supported the CPP because it required coal plants to install emission controls that were not ‘commercially proven’ at the time. It is unreasonable to ask power plants to utilize technologies that do not yet exist, and penalize them if they don’t. For this reason and others, the regulation became a subject of intense litigation causing further uncertainty for our power sector,” he said.

Gov. Justice Justice applauded the rule, calling it “President Trump’s rollback of Obama’s war on coal.”

“The Affordable Clean Energy Rule will give power where it belongs: back to the states. Places like California may be able to survive entirely on solar and wind and that’s great. But here in West Virginia, we live and die by the coal we mine and the oil and natural gas we produce,” he said.

“The Obama restrictions were so ridiculous and out of touch with the reality of life here in West Virginia, that thousands of people lost the lifestyle and standard of living they were accustomed to. This economic hopelessness in West Virginia led to a drug epidemic that we are still trying to recover from.”"
"Report: Marine general's crude remarks, treatment of women, created a negative work environment",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Tom Vanden Brook', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/19/marine-corps-general-rebuked-bullying-devaluing-women/1498965001/,"CLOSE A study by the Pentagon reveals that cases of sexual assault in the military ranks has increased 38% from 2016 to 2018. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps Commandant's former representative to Congress bullied his staff – including saying he'd castrate one of them – devalued women and created a negative work environment, according to a Pentagon Inspector General report released Wednesday.

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was the focus of the inspector general's investigation after the Senate Armed Services Committee complained about his behavior in February 2018. The inspector general referred Cooling's case back to the Marine Corps for discipline, and officials there are reviewing the report, Maj. Brian Block, a Marine spokesman, said Wednesday.

In a letter to investigators, Cooling challenged their findings. He wrote that ""'aggressive leadership is incorrectly deemed by the investigator to be negative.

""It was my responsibility to maintain the trust and confidence of my subordinates and I clearly pressed them to the point where some experienced work-related stress and may have questioned my motivations,"" he wrote. ""It should be noted that the comments perceived by some as inappropriate were related to substandard performance.""

Who is Mark Esper?: He's the new acting Defense Secretary. Here's what you need to know about him.

The Marine Corps removed Cooling from his post after seven months. He is currently assigned to the Marine Corps headquarters, Block said. A request for comment from Cooling was relayed to him by the Marine Corps, but there was no immediate response.

The report on Cooling comes as the military continues to address abuse in its ranks, including sexual harassment and assault. In its latest report, the Pentagon found that reports of sexual assault, for example, had increased 38% from 2016 to 2018.

On the decline: Misbehavior by top officials and officers is declining, Pentagon says

Among the allegations substantiated by the inspector general against Cooling:

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

The Senate complaint alleged that Cooling told ""members of his staff and a female Marine who was aiming to be a Marine pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a whorehouse than be a female Marine pilot.""

In a meeting with Senate staff, Cooling ""made the statement that opening combat roles to women had negatively impacted men because women are physically inferior to men and men could no longer refer to their rifle parts by the names of female body parts.""

Cooling disputed many of the findings in the report. For example, he wrote that the castration comment was a joke and that he had used the term ""brothel,"" not whorehouse. He denied making the comments about women in combat.

The inspector general largely disagreed. Investigators interviewed 37 witnesses and reviewed 11,650 emails.

""We substantiated the allegation that Brig. Gen. Cooling's overall course of conduct toward subordinates disparaged, bullied, humiliated them and devalued women,"" the report concluded. ""We determined that Brig. Gen. Cooling conducted himself in a less than exemplary manner in his treatment of subordinates or in comments that devalued women on seven occasions during his 7 month and 17 day tenure at (the Office of Legislative Affairs.)""

Defense chief steps down: Acting Defense Secretary resigns after scrutiny of 2010 domestic fight

The Marine Corps is reviewing the report and will take appropriate action, Block said.

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian – and particularly those in leadership positions – to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct,"" Block said in a statement. ""When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable.""

Washington Post: State Department official failed to disclose ties to Russian agent Maria Butina's boyfriend,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Sara Murray']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/state-department-official-ties-maria-butina/index.html,"Washington (CNN) State Department official Andrea Thompson, who is in charge of arms control negotiations with Russia, failed to disclose her connections to the former boyfriend of convicted Russian agent Maria Butina, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.

Thompson and her husband had ties to Paul Erickson, a GOP operative and Butina's former boyfriend , that she did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process, the Post reports.

Erickson officiated at the wedding of Thompson and her husband, David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson's lawyer confirmed to the Post.

At the time of the wedding, in June 2017, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, the Post reports.

Federal officials allege that Erickson stole $100,000 from Gillian four months before the wedding, the Post reports, citing FBI and court documents.

Schumer Requests Investigation Into Mnuchin’s Handling of the Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/schumer-harriet-tubman-bill.html,"In May, Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing that the design imagery of the bill would not be ready until 2026 because of the complexity of creating new anti-counterfeiting measures. He would not commit to Tubman ever appearing on its face and said that a future Treasury secretary would make that decision.

Mr. Mnuchin has denied delaying the process and said in a statement last week that Treasury and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing remain committed to the schedule of new $20 notes going into circulation by 2030.

Len Olijar, the director of the bureau, said that, for security reasons, design concepts of a new $20 note were never going to be released next year and that “everything remains on the table” regarding whose portrait will be on the new bill. Mr. Olijar said that the image of a $20 note that The Times obtained featuring Tubman’s portrait, which was created by the bureau, was not an advanced design concept.

After Mr. Trump took office, the Treasury Department removed from its website all mentions of Tubman or the planned changes to the $20, $10 and $5 notes that the Obama administration set in motion. Mr. Mnuchin had said little on the subject until he was pressed about it during a House Financial Services Committee hearing last month.

The delay of the new design has prompted calls for the Trump administration to follow through in adding Tubman to the note and bipartisan legislation in the House that would require the Treasury Department to do so next year.

Requests from Congress for inspector general inquiries do tend to yield responses. Mr. Mnuchin’s department has faced internal investigations into the secretary’s travel practices and into his handling of an analysis of the Republican tax cut legislation. The inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin’s air travel found he broke no laws in his use of military aircraft but lamented the loose justification provided for such costly flights. The tax cut analysis investigation found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff."

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."

"Pompeo overrules experts, keeps Saudi Arabia off US child soldiers list",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/saudi-arabia-child-soldiers-report-pompeo/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided not to include Saudi Arabia on the State Department's list of countries that recruit child soldiers and overruled his own team of experts, who argued that there was sufficient evidence to do so, a source familiar with the issue told CNN.

While the State Department is legally required to list all countries that use child soldiers, discussions about whether to include Saudi Arabia in the soon-to-be released report sparked a fierce internal debate between State Department officials and in-house experts.

Reuters was first to report the disagreement and Pompeo's decision to leave Saudi Arabia off the list.

A source familiar with the internal discussions told CNN that the State Department's experts on human trafficking recommended that the department include Saudi Arabia, in part, due to reports that the kingdom was using child soldiers from Sudan to fight for the US-backed coalition in Yemen -- a claim they said was corroborated by a military source.

Yet despite acknowledging that there are child soldiers fighting in Yemen, some State Department officials claimed that the evidence fell short of proving they were being led by Saudi commanders and pushed back on the experts' recommendation to include the kingdom on the list.

The source conceded that the decision was a very close call, adding that one could indeed argue there was not sufficient evidence, but the office that handles this issue felt there was enough to support its recommendation.

The State Department responded with only a brief statement to CNN: ""The United States condemns the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We place great importance on ending the practice.""

Saudi policy under scrutiny

News of the heated disagreement comes as Congress continues to question the Trump administration's policy on Saudi Arabia.

Despite bipartisan criticism over the kingdom's war in Yemen and its role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , the White House has sought an even closer relationship with the Saudis, as is evident by its push to sell them billions of dollars in weapons and munitions despite opposition in Congress.

Those concerns have only been amplified by the Trump administration's recent push to counter Iran and its view of Saudi Arabia as a key player in that effort.

On Wednesday, Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from New Jersey, accused Pompeo of intentionally misleading the public about Saudi Arabia's use of child soldiers in Yemen.

""Once again, Secretary Pompeo has shown he'll go to any lengths to lie for the Saudi government,"" Malinowski said in a tweet linking to the original Reuters report.

""The Child Soldiers Prevention Act sets up a two step process for identifying and holding accountable governments that use children as soldiers. The first step is a simple factual determination: the State Department must issue a list of countries that do this,"" Malinowski said.

""This is all Pompeo had to do: acknowledge the fact that Saudi Arabia is using at least one child soldier in the war in Yemen. And this fact is impossible to deny,"" he added, pointing to a New York Times story from December 2018 about how Saudi Arabia uses Sudanese militias that recruit children to fight in Yemen.

Malinowski then argued that Pompeo could have included Saudi Arabia on the list but opted not to punish the kingdom with sanctions -- a decision he says he would have opposed but would have been more honest.

""In step 2 of the process, the State Department decides whether a country is making a sincere effort to stop using child soldiers, and, until then, what consequences (like sanctions) should be applied,"" Malinowski tweeted.

""Pompeo could easily have done the honest thing and listed Saudi Arabia as having child soldiers, and then decided not to punish it. I would have disagreed with that decision, but it would have been lawful. Instead, he told a blatant, and utterly unnecessary lie: that the children fighting for Saudi Arabia in Yemen have nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. This is another blow to the credibility of the State Department at a time when it desperately needs it, given the crisis with Iran,"" he added.

Such cases, though, can be hard to prove.

Tillerson faced similar criticism

President Donald Trump's previous secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, faced similar criticism when he declined in 2017 to add Myanmar, Iraq and Afghanistan to the list of countries using child soldiers, also doing so against the recommendation of multiple State Department experts, serving in various bureaus.

That decision prompted a group of State employees to pen a memo accusing department leadership of violating US law by refusing to call out these countries.

The employees wrote, ""Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analysis and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world.""

At the time, then-State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said some of the allegations involved only ""one or two"" child soldiers, though she agreed that reporters were fair to ask whether one or two was still too many.

She commented in a statement that Tillerson had ""made this decision after considering the credibility of all of the information available to him from multiple sources.""

Asked by CNN what message that sends -- a secretary of state ruling against his own experts' credibility -- Nauert replied, ""I think it says that people had a different opinion on this particular matter, and the secretary weighed that opinion and thought about it."""
Trump hints at firing Powell ahead of Fed meeting: 'Let's see what he does',https://www.foxbusiness.com,['Megan Henney'],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-hints-at-firing-powell-ahead-of-fed-meeting-lets-see-what-he-does,"President Trump suggested on Tuesday that he could remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, one day before a critical interest rate decision in Washington by policymakers at the U.S. central bank.

“Well, let’s see what he does,” he said, when a reporter asked him whether he wanted to demote Powell, whom he hand-picked in 2017.

On Wednesday, the Fed will conclude its two-day meeting, during which it’s widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it opens the door for a cut in July. Trump has repeatedly pressured policymakers to lower borrowing costs and frequently criticized the Fed for raising interest rates in December -- the fourth time it did so in 2018.

Bloomberg News reported earlier in the day that the White House, in February, had explored the legality of stripping Powell of his chairmanship and leaving him as a Fed governor, just two months after Trump discussed firing him.

“I’m not going to comment,” President Trump’s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters. “It happened six months ago, and it’s not happening today, and therefore I have nothing to say about it.”

It’s unclear whether Trump has the power to fire Powell before his term ends in 2022. According to the law, the president can fire a Fed governor (for a cause) but it hasn’t been tested on the firing of a chair. Because the chair is considered to be a governor, it’s likely that it is legal.

Advisers, however, have reportedly warned Trump that firing Powell would rock the already volatile markets -- which is likely what he hopes to avoid by replacing the chair."
Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

Kushner transactions part of DOJ money laundering probe at Deutsche Bank,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/19/kushner-transactions-part-of-doj-money-laundering-probe-at-deutsche-bank/,"The Justice Department has opened up a criminal investigation into potential money- laundering violations by Deutsche Bank — including transactions linked to President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to a report.

The DOJ is investigating why the bank didn’t alert the US Treasury to potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and the Kushner Cos. in 2016, including money to Russian individuals, according to the New York Times.

Investigators are looking into why the bank didn’t file alerts, known as Suspicious Activity Reports, even though compliance employees had prepared them, according to the report.

DOJ investigators are relying on information provided by Tammy McFadden, a whistleblower who helped prepare the reports. They have been talking to Val Broeksmit, the son of a banker who oversaw a unit of the bank that’s been troubled by money-laundering violations since before the 2016 Kushner transaction.

That banker, William Broeksmit, committed suicide in 2014 and was profiled in The Post’s award-winning video “The Banker Suicides” in 2016.

A spokeswoman for Kushner Cos. told the NYT the firm is not under investigation. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the company would cooperate with “authorized investigations.”"
House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
The Defense Department Is Leaderless Again,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Kathy Gilsinan'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/shanahan-withdraws-defense-secretary-domestic-violence/591994/,"Announcing Shanahan’s withdrawal, President Donald Trump said in a pair of tweets that the former Boeing executive had decided to “devote more time to his family,” thanked him for his “outstanding service” and announced that Army Secretary Mark Esper would now serve as acting secretary of defense. The announcement came with no formal nomination of Esper for the post, meaning the Defense Department remains without a permanent head even as the United States faces a growing confrontation with Iran and dispatches more troops to the Middle East.

Shanahan, who previously served as deputy to then–Defense Secretary James Mattis, took over the department after Mattis abruptly resigned when Trump announced that he would pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, over Mattis’s objections. Trump ultimately agreed to leave a residual force of a few hundred troops there, but in the meantime, Shanahan’s efforts to defend the withdrawal earned him early skepticism from lawmakers. Senator Lindsey Graham, for one, told reporters that he had told Shanahan if the plan to completely withdraw were carried out, “I am now your adversary, not your friend.”

He faced skepticism or outright trouble, too, for Trump initiatives such as military funding of a border wall and the creation of a “space force,” the latter of which several lawmakers said would create unnecessary and expensive bureaucracy. In contrast to Mattis, who had a reputation as a warrior-intellectual, Shanahan seemed to struggle when answering questions in congressional hearings. Also unlike Mattis, he had no background to speak of in foreign-policy or defense affairs.

It took Trump a full five months to announce that he intended to nominate Shanahan to fill the role, much to the relief of Senate lawmakers who were growing impatient to have a permanent defense secretary. Trump’s hesitation reportedly stemmed in part from Shanahan’s three-decade career at Boeing, which was then dominating the headlines over two separate crashes of its 737 Max 8 plane. (Shanahan worked on a different program while at Boeing, but his reported reputation in Trump’s eyes as “the Boeing guy” complicated his prospects.)

Yet a month after Trump said Shanahan was his pick, he still hadn’t sent his nomination to Congress. Reports surfaced that Trump might have been souring on his pick and looking for alternatives—others suggested that paperwork was to blame.

In the end, though, it was a harrowing personal story that made Shanahan’s continued service untenable. The Washington Post reported that his wife had punched him and that his son had beaten her with a baseball bat; his wife told police that Shanahan had punched her in the stomach, though he denied that. Shanahan’s statement said: “I would welcome the opportunity to be Secretary of Defense, but not at the expense of being a good father.”

The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

Paul Manafort’s transfer from Rikers Island shows how corrupt the DOJ really is,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Harry Litman', 'Contributing Columnist Focused On Legal Issues', 'Contributing Columnist', 'June At Pm', 'A Washington Post Contributing Columnist', 'Is A Former U.S. Attorney', 'Deputy Assistant Attorney General.

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Eastern Carolina friends changing vacation plans after tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://www.witn.com,['Grace Holland'],,,,https://www.witn.com/content/news/Eastern-Carolina-friends-changing-vacation-plans-after-tourist-deaths-in-the-Dominican-Republic-511548452.html,"Summer season means vacation time for many, but some across the country are rethinking travel plans after nine Americans died while visiting the Dominican Republic.

A group of friends from here in Eastern Carolina say they've been planning a trip to the Dominican Republic for months. Now they're terrified and making other arrangements.

""It's just a nice place to go until all of this stuff started happening,"" said Altere Lewis who is scheduled to visit the country next week as part of a birthday trip for a friend.

The deaths in the Dominican Republic haven't been connected and Lewis says at first she wasn't worried when her friend started planning the trip in January.

""We're just young girls looking for a good time having a vacation,"" said Lewis.

Her mother started asking questions when she says she saw more and more news alerts about American tourists dying in the country. Lewis says that's when the fear hit them.

""We don't really know what's happening and that could possibly be us,"" said Lewis.

Now she and her friends are trying to change their travel plans after they've already paid thousands each for the trip. Lewis says the booking site they used will likely charge them hundreds more to change the location.

""We're not going to the Dominican Republic. I can assure you that,"" said Lewis.

Her mother says she is trying to help the girls as much as she can.

""Just take it upon ourselves to just keep right on being parents and take wheel from them,"" said Cubatrina Marrow.

Altere Lewis says whether they are able to change the plans or not, no trip to paradise is worth their peace of mind.

""It's not really a vacation if we're scared to death,"" said Lewis.

Lewis says she and her friends are not booked at any of the hotels where tourists have died but they're hoping to get plans changed before they are supposed to leave next Thursday."

Cooking outdoors is challenging, especially during the summer. Be sure to follow these steps to food safety to prepare for the occasion!

The summer months are the perfect excuse to spend time at the beach. The best memories in my childhood are with my family enjoying a day at the beach grilling. My parents organized every detail of the trip but looking back and knowing what I know now about food safety, our beach grilling fun could have easily been spoiled with bacteria that could have made us sick.

There are always challenges when cooking outdoors, but a little bit of preparation can have you basking in the sun, enjoying some well-deserved beach time with the family.

Before Firing Up the Beach - Grill

Make sure local ordinances allow grilling activities. If yes…it’s time to pack!

Only pack the amount of food you will consume to avoid leftovers.

Season your favorite meats, poultry or seafood at home before packing them for the trip. Remember to wash your hands before handling the raw items and in between spice containers when seasoning.

Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler.

Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry tightly wrapped and store them at the bottom of the cooler. This will help keep any running juices away from cooked foods or foods meant to be eaten raw (e.g. fruits, veggies, salsas, guacamole or bean salad).

Pack the drinks in a separate cooler so the food cooler is not opened frequently.

A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. If you still have space in your portable cooler, pack it full with more ice.

Don’t forget to bring moist towelettes and the food thermometer!

Keeping Food Safe Ashore

Once you arrive at the beach, partially bury your portable cooler in the sand, cover it with blankets or towels, and shade it under a tree or with a beach umbrella.

Do not open the lid of your cooler containing perishable foods unless necessary. This will keep perishable foods colder for a longer time.

Don't leave any perishables sitting out in the hot sun for more than 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F).

Start setting up your grill and get it clean before bringing the food out.

Clean your hands before placing any foods on the grill.

Beach - Grill Time

Make sure your grilled items are safe to eat by using a food thermometer and checking to see if they reached the right minimum internal temperatures: Beef, pork, lamb and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145°F with a three-minute rest. Fish: 145°F Ground beef, veal, lamb, or pork burgers: 160°F. Poultry (whole or ground): 165°F.

Serve all your delicious food using clean plates and utensils.

Remember: Clean your hands before starting to eat!

If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET. Callers may also listen to food safety messages on various topics, recorded in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day. You can also email or chat via Ask Karen."
"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Paul Takahashi', 'Staff Writer', 'Perla Trevizo', 'Erin Douglas', 'Jordan Rubio', 'Staff Writers']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

Interior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/449247-interior-spending-bill-holds-trump-administration,"This week, the U.S. House of Representatives will take up its spending bill for the U.S. Department of the Interior for fiscal year 2020. The bill advanced out of the House Appropriations Committee with $13.8 billion budgeted for the agency, including increases in funding for conservation, public lands and wildlife management, but also containing revenue language related to the proposed Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil and gas leasing program and aimed at protecting American citizens. The House should pass its appropriations bill with this language intact, and if their colleagues in the Senate truly care about not only preserving our public lands but protecting American taxpayers as well, they will do the same.

Two years ago, the widely opposed Trump tax cuts mortgaged the future of seniors and working families in order to hand massive tax breaks to Wall Street, corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. At the same time, oil industry allies in Congress were able to circumvent normal legislative channels and take advantage of an expedited legislative process to include an Arctic Refuge drilling program in the tax bill. They knew that winning support for such a controversial measure in an above-board process would otherwise have been impossible.

The tax bill also took the unprecedented step of making oil leasing and development one of the official purposes of the Arctic Refuge — no other national wildlife refuge has oil and gas as a statutory purpose — undercutting the integrity of the Arctic Refuge and setting a dangerous precedent for America’s entire National Wildlife Refuge System.

When the unpopular tax bill passed, the Trump administration and its allies defended the equally unpopular Arctic drilling provision by claiming that opening the Arctic Refuge to leasing would generate billions for the U.S. treasury. What the language of the Interior appropriations bill does now is simply require Interior to set a minimum bid capable of generating the revenues promised by the tax bill — the agency can only move forward with a lease sale if it ensures the sale raises at least half of the $1 billion agreed to in the FY2018 budget resolution. By requiring a floor on what companies must pay to lease a piece of the Arctic Refuge’s fragile coastal plain, this provision holds the Trump administration accountable to its own promises.

Let’s be clear that we believe leasing and development should never occur in the Arctic Refuge, and Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumInterior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises House Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration House Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee’s Interior-Environment Subcommittee, summed it up succinctly following committee markup of this year’s Interior bill: ""I oppose opening ANWR, but now that it's in the tax bill, we must ensure the American taxpayer is protected.""

From the very beginning, the stated reason for having a federal oil and gas program in the Arctic Refuge was always to raise revenue for the federal treasury. There was never any real evidence to back up the billion-dollar claim, and in fact many experts at the time pointed out that raising the proposed revenue would depend on the highly unlikely scenario of leasing nearly every acre of the coastal plain at sky-high prices. What is illuminating, however, has been the reaction and artificial offense taken by the architects of the Arctic Refuge leasing program to this Interior bill language.

Following the House markup, Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiInterior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises Hillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data Hillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data MORE (R-Alaska), the driving force pushing for Arctic Refuge development, was quoted as saying, ""I think what they've set up is something that's designed to kill exploration in ANWR.""

And in a letter to Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, the White House Office of Management and Budget wrote:

In addition, section 118 prohibits DOI from using funds to conduct a lease sale in the Coastal Plain (1002 area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, unless that sale meets arbitrary national minimum bid criteria. This restriction imposes unnecessary and unrealistic restrictions on leasing in an area that the Congress has already authorized.

Think about that for a second. The driving force behind the leasing program, Lisa Murkowski, admits that requiring minimum bids today to meet revenue she herself defended two years ago would “kill exploration” in the Arctic Refuge. The Trump administration has put in writing that it believes the projections used to sell Congress and the public on allowing oil development were “arbitrary” and “unnecessary and unrealistic.” As a reminder, the ONLY reason an Arctic Refuge leasing program was able to be included in the reconciliation process in the first places was as a billion-dollar offset for tax cuts.

Call it lying to the American public, call it misleading, but whatever you call it, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been opened to the risk of a massive oil drilling operation based on willful dishonesty. Experts didn’t buy the numbers then, and they still don’t today. And now we know Murkowski and the Trump administration never really believed their own promises either.

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

""Helping students and their families avoid the pitfalls associated with financing higher education, and empowering them to make optimal financial choices, should be a priority of all institutions of higher education,"" the report reads. ﻿"

But congressional Democrats have grown alarmed by what they consider a large number of inappropriate contacts between the White House and Justice Department, sparking new calls to create a more firm standard of limiting the number of advisers in those two camps who can speak with one another about federal investigations.

The issue received a jolt of national attention when Attorney General William P. Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in early May, leading Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) to ask whether any White House officials had “asked or suggested that you open an investigation” in his brief tenure.

“I‘m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of matters out there,” Barr said, at times stammering to find an answer.

Harris asked whether they “suggested” an investigation. “I don’t know. I wouldn’t say suggest,” he replied. Did they hint at a probe?

“I don’t know,” Barr replied.

Pelosi faces twin challenge on Trump impeachment — tamp down talk and give nation a tutorial on the process

So Harris signed on with Whitehouse and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), along with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) in the House, on legislation that would try to codify lines of communication between presidential advisers and Justice Department officials, requiring the department to keep logs of all discussions. The department aides would keep track of every White House adviser who spoke to a Justice official about which investigations, then turn over those logs to the inspector general and Congress every six months.

It’s actually a repeat bill for Whitehouse, who first introduced the legislation in 2007 when oversight of the Bush Justice Department faced several political scandals that revealed a much more wide-open world of discussions about investigations. Democrats and some Republicans questioned back then whether Bush’s political advisers, including Karl Rove, forced the firings of U.S. attorneys who did not pursue voter fraud cases against liberal organizations.

Whitehouse’s legislation passed on a 14-to-2 vote in committee, with the support of two senior Republicans still on the panel, Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and John Cornyn (Tex.). The legislation went away, Whitehouse recalled, because Bush’s final attorney general, Michael Mukasey, agreed to return to the old standard of limited talks about investigations.

Whitehouse believes that standard seemed to be applied through the Obama administration and even in the early days of Jeff Sessions’s tenure as attorney general. By late 2017 Sessions appointed Matthew G. Whitaker as his chief of staff, a move that eventually led Trump to insert Whitaker as acting attorney general for several months last winter after he forced Sessions to resign.

“Everything having to do with the Whitaker era was very stinky and weird but he appeared to be a walking violation of this rule. So, that’s why I decided to re-up the bill,” Whitehouse said.

Senate aides cited several instances where Whitaker, as chief of staff, is alleged to have held discussions with Trump and John Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, about how to pressure Justice Department officials into launching a special counsel investigation into political adversaries.

Another allegation focused on reports that Trump asked Whitaker, as acting attorney general, to appoint a certain prosecutor to handle the investigation into his former personal lawyer’s payoffs to the president’s alleged mistresses.

Whitaker has denied any wrongdoing in his discussions with Trump or other presidential advisers.

Facing ‘Grim Reaper’ McConnell, Democrats experience a role reversal from eight years ago

And Democrats have stumbled into an area that seems to violate the spirit of the separation of the West Wing from the main Justice Department. In a recent interview with NPR, touting her 2020 presidential credentials, Harris said that as president her Justice Department “would have no choice” but to prosecute Trump on obstruction-of-justice charges related to the special counsel’s findings in the investigation of Russian interference in 2016.

Other presidential contenders have made similar comments, seeming to prejudge the case, while others have been careful to say the matter would be left to top prosecutors.

Democrats have long complained that Trump violates all sorts of norms in private conversations with aides who work for him, but also in his tweets.

But the president’s direct public actions, on social media or to the media, are actually of less concern to legal experts, because those comments are out in the open and the accused has an ability to defend themselves before judges and cite presidential political pressure.

“There is something grotesque to a president of the United States tweeting out his desire to see people prosecuted,” Whitehouse said, suggesting that “indirect pressure” from White House officials is more dangerous to making sure justice is meted out on the law.

“Sycophantic Department of Justice officials tilting investigative and prosecutive decisions because they think they’ll get a pat on the head or an extra invitation to a White House dinner,” he said, explaining the worst-case scenario. “ . . . is a very dangerous characteristic in an attorney general.”

Republicans have not signed onto the Democratic legislation, with hopes of action in the Senate looking slim given the GOP majority there. But Jeffries, part of the House’s leadership team, is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and could get the bill moving on that side of the Capitol.

The goal is to avoid one thing, Whitehouse said: “The Department of Justice gets weaponized politically.”

Trump envoy not ruling out using Afghan war law to justify Iranian strikes,https://www.politico.com,"['Nahal Toosi', 'Burgess Everett', 'Bianca Quilantan', 'Matthew Choi']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/trump-state-department-iran-military-strike-1370531,"Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said that there is ""no talk of offensive action"" against Iran, but did not rule out the possibility of a war. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo foreign policy Trump envoy not ruling out using Afghan war law to justify Iranian strikes 'We’re not seeking military action,' said Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran. 'There is no talk of offensive action.'

The State Department’s top official on Iran declined Wednesday to rule out the possibility that the Trump administration might justify a military confrontation with Tehran using the 2001 law that authorized the Afghanistan war.

Brian Hook, the department’s special representative for Iran, insisted that any move President Donald Trump makes would be legally sound. But that is unlikely to reassure Democrats and some Republicans who say the president is dangerously escalating tensions with Iran and are fearful Trump’s team will bypass Congress to launch military strikes against the country.

Story Continued Below

“We’re not seeking military action,” Hook told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Middle East subpanel. He added, however, that if it comes down to such a confrontation, “we will do everything that we are required to do with respect to congressional war powers, and we will comply with the law.”

Hook’s appearance on Capitol Hill comes as the U.S. and Iran are engaged in a standoff in the wake of attacks on oil tankers in the Middle East that Washington blames on Tehran. Iran also said this week that it would soon violate limits on its nuclear program set under a 2015 international agreement.

Democratic New York Rep. Eliot Engel, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the lawmakers who pushed Hook on the question of whether the Trump administration believes the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force would cover a military battle with Iran.

“I see a growing risk of miscalculation,” Engel said.

That AUMF was passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It is generally interpreted as giving congressional authorization for U.S. military action in Afghanistan, as well as against al-Qaida and its affiliates.

In recent weeks, some Trump administration officials have tried to suggest that Iran has more substantial links to al-Qaida than is generally believed. That, combined with Trump’s expressed desire to often act unilaterally, has fueled concerns that the administration may invoke the 2001 measure to justify a military battle with Iran.

Hook deferred lawmakers to administration lawyers on the question of the AUMF, but he said “no” when asked if Iran was one of the entities responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1887/1155968404_6048022275001_6048027772001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Hook did not rule out the possibility of a war with Iran, although he at one point said that as far as the U.S. is thinking now, “There is no talk of offensive action. It’s a defensive move.”

Hook also said the Trump team’s efforts to starve Iran’s Islamist regime of revenue that it uses to pay militias and terrorist groups in the Middle East is working.

“Hezbollah has placed piggy banks in grocery stores and in retail outlets,” Hook said, referring to the Iran-affiliated militia and political movement in Lebanon that the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group.

The Trump administration wants Iran to come to the negotiating table in the hopes of hammering out an agreement that covers at least four key areas, Hook added: ending Tehran’s nuclear program; curbing its ballistic missile program; stopping its support for terrorist groups and other militias; and halting Iran’s arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens.

“No one should be uncertain about our desire for peace or our readiness to normalize relations” with Iran, Hook said.

In recent days, both Iranian and American officials have simultaneously tried to de-escalate the situation while nonetheless holding out the possibility of military action. Trump, for instance, downplayed the oil tanker attacks in a Time interview earlier this week, and a senior Iranian official on Wednesday said “there will not be a military confrontation” between his country and the U.S.

But the Pentagon did announce on Monday that it was sending an extra 1,000 troops to the Middle East for “defensive purposes.”

Hook insisted on the soundness of U.S. intelligence linking Iran to the attacks on the oil tankers, and he dismissed concerns voiced by Democrats that the Trump administration is cherry-picking the information it is receiving.

At one point, referring to the attacks on two oil tankers last week, Hook said: ""A senior IRGC official confirmed that personnel, IRGC personnel, had completed two actions,"" referencing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a major Iranian military force.

It was not clear if Hook was saying an IRGC official confirmed the information to the United States or whether the U.S. had picked up that intelligence through other means, such as intercepts.

Iran and the United States have been adversaries for 40 years, and they do not officially have diplomatic relations. But the relationship has grown especially rocky since May 2018, when Trump decided to pull the United States out of the internationally negotiated nuclear deal with Iran.

Trump reimposed nuclear sanctions on Iran that had been removed as part of the deal, and piled on new economic penalties that have badly damaged the Iranian economy.

While Iran’s Islamist government has until now tried to abide by its part of the agreement and restrict its nuclear program, it said this week that it would likely breach some of those restrictions before the end of the month.

Iran’s announcement, as well as the tanker attacks, which Iran denies a role in, have deepened a rift between the U.S. and European allies who have tried to salvage the nuclear deal.

The rising tensions also come as Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, Patrick Shanahan, announced this week that he was resigning. Shanahan will hand the acting Pentagon chief role to Mark Esper, currently secretary of the Army."
First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for a DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."

SAUGET, Ill. – The Environmental Protection Agency is allowing a waste incinerator in Sauget, Illinois to emit heavy metals into the air. Dozens of residents gathered outside the plant to protest what they claim is the burning of hazardous waste in their community.

“We are going to fight the good fight and save our community, save our children,” said Mamie Cosey.

Some residents are outraged after the EPA announced it will allow Veolia North America Trade Waste Incineration to relax heavy metal emissions monitoring.

“If they were concerned about the children and seniors they would be glad to put up a monitor,” Cosey said.

Dozens gathered in front of the facility Wednesday in protest with masks on their faces and signs in their hands demanding the EPA reverse its decision.

The EPA released a statement and the new permit goes into effect in July. It will require Veolia to install and operate mercury emission controls on two incinerators that previously did not have mercury controls. The permit continues to include significant improvements to Veolia's feedstream.

“Yesterday, EPA ruled in favor of the company after telling us they considered all viewpoints but they only considered one viewpoint,” said protester Cheryl Sommer.

The facility accepts waste such as explosives, poisonous material for disposal, and reactive metals. The EPA added that the permit will continue to include significant improvements for the company residents disagree.

Fox 2/News 11 reached out to the incinerator company to try and get a response but we’ve yet to hear back. However, in previous reports, Veolia said it worked with the EPA to ensure it was following regulations set under the Clean Air Act.

Meanwhile, residents said they plan to appeal the EPA’s decision."
I-Team: U.S. Department of Education investigating Duke-UNC Consortium after complaints of anti-Semitism,https://abc11.com,['Jonah Kaplan'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://abc11.com/i-team-us-dept-of-education-investigating-duke-unc-consortium/5350504/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together. I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone."" That was before he sang a song with the lyrics: ""Don't think of Rihanna when you sing this, don't think of Beyonce - think of Mel Gibson. I'm in love with a Jew/Oh/I fell in love with a Jew/Oh/Her skin is white and my skin is brown, she was going up up and I was going down.""""I'd like to thank Secretary Devos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,"" Rep. Holding said in response to the new investigation. ""I hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.""Many department heads and sponsors demanded their money back after the controversy erupted.In a scathing letter to leaders of the UNC Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies, which officially sponsored the event, UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley said: ""Due to your inclusion of conference content over which I had no knowledge or control, I have been forced to spend most of the last two days responding to outraged members of my own community who are ashamed and embarrassed to see the law school shown as a sponsor of what they consider hate speech.""A statement released by UNC Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz called the performance ""disturbing"" and that he is ""heartbroken and deeply offended that this performance happened. I stand steadfast against Anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.""UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to directly answer any questions about the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, the university said."

Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""



Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""



(Evanston Fire Department)

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""

Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
