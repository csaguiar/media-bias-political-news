Madeleine Westerhout, who left her White House job suddenly on Thursday as President Trump’s personal assistant, was fired after bragging to reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, and that the president did not like being in pictures with Tiffany because he perceived her as overweight.

Given Westerhout’s sensitive role as a confidante to the president, the few details the White House shared about her abrupt firing had Washington’s political-media class in a quiet frenzy on Thursday night and Friday.

The critical comments happened at an off-the-record dinner, according to two people familiar with the matter, that Westerhout and deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley held earlier this month with reporters who were covering Trump’s vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Westerhout also jokingly told the journalists that Trump couldn’t pick Tiffany out of a crowd, said one of the people. “She had a couple drinks and in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she opened up to the reporters,” the person said.

At some point, Gidley left the restaurant for a television interview on Fox News. During that time — around 45 minutes to an hour — Westerhout made the comments to the reporters.

After the Aug. 17 dinner, which took place at the restaurant inside the nearby Embassy Suites hotel and included the Washington Post’s Phil Rucker, Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs, Reuters’ Steve Holland and the Wall Street Journal’s Andrew Restuccia, Westerhout rode back to a different hotel, the Marriott, with Rucker and Holland.

White House staffers having off-the-record dinners or drinks with reporters has long been a commonplace practice when a president is traveling.

“This was an off-the-record dinner and the media blatantly violated that agreement,” an administration official said.

Arthur Schwartz, a confidant of Donald Trump Jr. who spars frequently with the media, accused Rucker on Friday in a series of tweets of having “burned” Westerhout and of violating the Washington Post’s policies on sourcing.

Rucker referred a request for comment to the Washington Post, while the other reporters present either declined to comment or referred requests to spokespeople for their news organizations.

“Philip Rucker is one of the best and most scrupulous reporters in the news business,” said Steven Ginsberg, national editor at the Washington Post, in an emailed statement. “He has always acted with the utmost honor and integrity and has never violated Washington Post standards or policies.”

Trump on Friday confirmed that Westerhout had been dismissed for talking to reporters about his children, calling the comments ""a little bit hurtful.""

""It was too bad,"" Trump told reporters before leaving the White House for Camp David, adding that Westerhout was a ""very good person"" who performed her job well. ""I wished her well.""

Trump said he would speak by phone with Tiffany when he reached Camp David, disputing that he had ever personally disparaged his daughter.

“I love Tiffany,” he said.

The White House and Westerhout declined to comment.

Other officials were wary of Westerhout, who did not work on the campaign and joined Trump’s team after the 2016 election. She kept largely to herself, several noted, but frequently posted pictures on Instagram of life in the White House.

POLITICO’s Tim Alberta reported in his recent book, “American Carnage,” that Westerhout was observed crying on election night because she was unhappy that Trump had won. But she found her way into a top job at the White House, having previously worked at the Republican National Committee.

During the transition period, Westerhout was known as “elevator girl” or “greeter girl” because she was often photographed escorting guests to see the then president-elect at his office at Trump Tower in Manhattan. She was previously an assistant to Katie Walsh, a top RNC official who also joined the White House, only to resign just months into her tenure as deputy chief of staff.

Westerhout, 28, was a key gatekeeper for the president, screening his official calls and controlling the access of outside advisers. In February, she blasted an unknown person who leaked three months of his calendars to the press.

“What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday,” Westerhout tweeted at the time. “This POTUS is working harder for the American people than anyone in recent history.”

Westerhout’s public displays of loyalty ran her afoul of the Office of Special Counsel, which reprimanded her earlier this year for violating the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that prohibits federal officials from engaging in overtly political activity in the course of their official duties.

And as one of a dwindling number of officials to have served in Trump’s White House since its earliest days, she was an important source of continuity for a tumultuous presidency.

“Madeleine is the key,” Trump told the Washington Post in a 2018 interview. “She’s the secret.”

White House officials were buzzing all day on Friday, trying to understand her sudden firing.

“It is a good reminder that we are all staff,"" a White House official said. ""We are all replaceable.""

President Trump Tweets Sensitive Surveillance Image of Iran,https://www.npr.org,['Geoff Brumfiel'],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/755994591/president-trump-tweets-sensitive-surveillance-image-of-iran,"President Trump Tweets Sensitive Surveillance Image of Iran

President Trump has tweeted what experts say is almost certainly an image from a classified satellite or drone, showing the aftermath of an accident at an Iranian space facility.

""The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,"" the president said in a tweet that accompanied the image on Friday. ""I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.""

NPR broke the news of the launch failure on Thursday, using images from commercial satellites that flew over Iran's Imam Khomeini Space Center. Those images showed smoke billowing from the pad. Iran has since acknowledged an accident occurred at the site.

Some of the highest-resolution imagery available commercially comes from the company Maxar, whose WorldView-2 satellite sports 46-centimeter resolution.

But the image shown in the president's tweet appears to be of far better quality, says Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, who specializes in analyzing satellite imagery. ""The resolution is amazingly high,"" says Panda. ""I would think it's probably below well below 20 centimeters, which is much higher than anything I've ever seen.""

Panda says that the tweet discloses ""some pretty amazing capabilities that the public simply wasn't privy to before this.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions about the image to the White House, which declined to comment.

The image shows the aftermath of the accident, which experts believe took place while the rocket was being fueled. Clearly visible is the truck used to transport and erect the rocket, and the words ""The product of national empowerment,"" which have been written along the edge of the pad. The picture also shows extensive debris and charring around the pad.

It was not entirely clear where the president's photo came from. Panda believes it was most likely taken by a classified U.S. satellite. But Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network at the One Earth Foundation, believes that the resolution is so high, it may be beyond the physical limits at which satellites can operate. ""The atmosphere is thick enough that after somewhere around 11 to 9 centimeters, things get wonky,"" she says.

That could mean it was taken by a drone or spy plane, though such a vehicle would be violating Iranian airspace. Hanham also says that the European company Airbus has been experimenting with drones that fly so high, they are technically outside the atmosphere and thus operating outside national boundaries. But she says she doesn't know whether the U.S. has such a system.

Glare in the center of the image suggests the image in the tweet was itself a photo of a briefing slide. Panda suggests it could have been displayed on a computer screen in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. It's also possible it was a photo of a piece of paper.

Either way, Panda notes that a small redaction in the upper left-hand corner suggests the intelligence community had cleared the image for release by the president.

But both he and Hanham question whether releasing it was a good idea. ""You really risk giving away the way you know things,"" Hanham says. ""That allows people to adapt and hide how they carry out illicit activity.""

""These are closely held national secrets,"" Panda adds. ""We don't even share a lot of this kind of imagery with our closest allies."" In tweeting it out to the world, Trump is letting Iran know exactly what the U.S. is capable of. He's also letting others know as well, Panda says. ""The Russians and the Chinese, you're letting them know that these are the kind of things that the United States has the capability of seeing,"" he says.

Top Trump aide reportedly most scared of Kamala Harris: She's 'the least flawed' of 2020 Dems,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was the scariest would-be opponent for President Trump's reelection bid, one of the president's top campaign officials has reportedly said.

“The one who scares me the most in the general is Kamala Harris,"" the official said. Described by The Washington Times as a ""key player"" in Trump's campaign, the official said Harris was the ""least flawed"" Democratic hopeful in the crowded field of presidential aspirants,

“The top candidates are all flawed candidates, but the least flawed is Kamala Harris,"" the official reportedly said.

WARREN OUTPACES SANDERS IN NEW 2020 POLLS, BIDEN RETAINS FRONT-RUNNER POSITION

The reported comments came as the party's frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has caught flak over a string of verbal errors and missstatements.

August polling has shown Harris trailing at least a few other candidates, including Biden, but she has consistently ranked among the top contenders and was floated as a potential choice for vice president.

She's also shown that she's willing to call the former vice president out in her race to the top. The former prosecutor saw a bump in the polls after she made Biden's controversial comments about race personal at the first Democratic primary debate.

Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., seemed to be the biggest hurdles to Harris taking Biden's spot as the party's frontrunner. Both, however, have been tagged by Republicans as far-left socialists.

DNC MOVE TO SCRAP VIRTUAL CAUCUSES SPARKS NEW PARTY TENSIONS

While Warren has peppered the press with a slew of policy proposals, Harris seemed to position herself as a more realistic candidate.

During a radio interview in July, Harris agreed with host DJ Envy, who mocked the 2020 field's long list of giveaways. DJ Envy said that while all those proposals sounded good, he wanted to know what presidential candidates could ""really do.""

""That's right,"" Harris said, before adding, ""that's why I'm not churning out plans like a factory -- because it is really important to me that any plan that I am prepared to implement is actually doable.""

Bolton sidelined from Afghanistan policy as his standing with Trump falters,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['John Hudson', 'National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department', 'Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'August At Pm']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/bolton-sidelined-from-afghanistan-policy-as-his-standing-with-trump-falters/2019/08/30/79651256-8888-483b-9fd1-c47a2cfadab7_story.html,"As the president’s top aides prepared for a high-stakes meeting on the future of Afghanistan earlier this month, one senior official was not on the original invite list: national security adviser John Bolton.

The attendance of the top security aide would normally be critical, but the omission was no mistake, senior U.S. officials said. Bolton, who has long advocated an expansive military presence around the world, has become a staunch internal foe of an emerging peace deal aimed at ending America’s longest war, the officials said.

His opposition to the diplomatic effort in Afghanistan has irritated President Trump, these officials said, and led aides to leave the National Security Council out of sensitive discussions about the agreement.

The sidelining of Bolton has raised questions about his influence in an administration that is seeking a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as an ambitious nuclear deal with North Korea and potential engagement with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Bolton, U.S. officials said, stands in opposition to those efforts, but he does so increasingly from the periphery.

“It’s messed up on so many levels that the national security adviser isn’t involved, but trust is a real issue,” said a senior U.S. official, one of a half-dozen who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

At the zenith of his influence, Bolton enabled the president to act on his most aggressive instincts and outmaneuvered other Cabinet officials with less experience in the interagency process. But his tough management style and bellicose worldview have frayed relations with some colleagues.

In a recent standoff, Bolton asked for a copy of the draft agreement the United States is trying to strike with the Taliban. But the U.S. envoy leading the negotiations, Zalmay Khalilzad, denied the request, saying Bolton could read the agreement in the presence of a senior official but not leave with it in hand, U.S. officials said. One official said the incident infuriated Bolton, while another downplayed it, saying the draft was eventually sent to the National Security Council staff.

“I can’t think of another example where a national security adviser was sidelined like this,” said Tom Wright, an international security expert at the Brookings Institution. “One thing that makes this different from normal bureaucratic infighting is that Bolton has pitted himself against a policy the president clearly supports.”

On Thursday, Trump said in a Fox News interview that he plans to draw down the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 and “then we make a determination from there as to what happens.” Bolton is not fighting that partial withdrawal decision, but U.S. officials said he remains deeply opposed to Khalilzad’s emerging deal. The agreement would see the partial removal of U.S. troops in exchange for the Taliban renouncing al-Qaeda and preventing the group from recruiting, fundraising, training and other activities.

U.S. officials also expect the agreement to advance talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government and an eventual cease-fire that would lead to a full U.S. and NATO withdrawal possibly by the end of next year. They have conceded that thorny questions about a residual U.S. counterterrorism presence remain unresolved. Khalilzad continued negotiations with Afghan and Taliban officials this week, but any agreement will require Trump’s final approval.

Bolton’s isolation on Afghanistan became particularly apparent this month when the president’s top officials descended on Trump’s New Jersey golf resort to discuss the peace deal that would be presented to Afghan and Taliban officials in Kabul and Doha, Qatar, U.S. officials said. In addition to the president, the Aug. 16 meeting included Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper; Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Vice President Pence; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; CIA Director Gina Haspel; and Khalilzad. Bolton was not originally invited out of concern that his team would oppose the agenda and leak the details later, several officials said.

“His team has a reputation for losing and leaking,” said one senior administration official with direct knowledge of the discussions.

Bolton rejected the allegation, saying in a statement, “I categorically deny leaks by me or anyone authorized to speak to the press. Those alleging such leaks should look in the mirror.” A senior White House official also disputed the leak claims.

Eventually, Bolton secured a spot at the meeting after one of his aides appealed to White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, according to a U.S. official. During the meeting, Bolton and the president exchanged opposing views over policy options on Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. Critics have questioned whether the Taliban can be trusted to fulfill its promises.

Pentagon and State Department leaders are comfortable with the broad outlines of Khalilzad’s plan, though maintaining a counterterrorism presence will be critical, officials said. On Wednesday, Dunford stressed that all elements of the deal would be “conditions-based.”

The fight over Afghanistan represents just one of several clashes between Bolton and other members of the administration, with several new ones on the horizon.

On Monday, Trump expressed a willingness to a meet with Iran’s president, ruled out any plans for regime change in the country and said discussions were underway to see if other nations could extend a “letter of credit” to bolster Iran’s ailing economy. Bolton for years has spoken in support of regime change in Iran and has pressed for more sanctions even as the risk of military conflict between the two adversaries grows.

On North Korea, Trump has continued to push for a nuclear deal while downplaying Pyongyang’s recurring short-range ballistic missile tests as something “many nations” do. Bolton, whom Trump has kept out of key meetings with North Korean officials, has criticized the tests, underscoring that they violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. An NSC spokesman stressed that Bolton “continues to support the president’s position for complete denuclearization of North Korea.”

Amid the tensions, Bolton has sought to amplify the diplomatic nature of the national security adviser job, with trips this week to Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus. Despite his differences with Trump, he has found a way to achieve some of his lifelong goals, defunding various United Nations organizations and ripping up international treaties he views as a constraint on American power, such as the Reagan-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. He has also had a leading role on Russia policy, holding several meetings with his Russian counterpart Nikolai Patrushev in Moscow and elsewhere.

Defenders of Bolton say while his influence may ebb and flow, he still finds moments to impact policy, such as the president’s last-minute decision to walk away from a deal with North Korea in Hanoi. Officials say Bolton opposed the partial denuclearization agreement under discussion.

Bolton’s pugnacious views on military force are matched with a fiery temperament. Earlier this year, he got into a confrontation with White House Staff Secretary Derek Lyons in the West Wing, according to people familiar with the incident. The president had signed off on a statement concerning the International Criminal Court, and Bolton didn’t want to give Pompeo or other senior White House officials a chance to look at it or make comments, the people said. With Pompeo out of Washington on a trip at the time, the disagreement over the statement’s release escalated.

One person familiar said Bolton was merely trying to execute the president’s orders. Others said he taunted Lyons, asking him, “Did you have fun today?”

“You better watch out, buddy,” Bolton added, the people said.

Trump is expected to make a decision on the path forward on Afghanistan in the coming days as he aims to fulfill a promise of ending America’s “endless wars.” In the meantime, the decision-making process will continue to test his relationship with his national security adviser.

“Bolton has long said that he’s the president’s advocate, and his job is to implement his vision,” Wright said. “For quite awhile they were compatible, but it now seems to be coming apart.”"

Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."
The Justice Department Can’t Keep Its Own Law Secret Forever,https://www.politico.com,"['Jack Shafer', 'Cristian Farias']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/29/the-justice-department-cant-keep-its-own-law-secret-forever-227984,"Win McNamee/Getty Images Law And Order The Justice Department Can’t Keep Its Own Law Secret Forever

Cristian Farias is a former member of The New York Times’ editorial board and a writer-in-residence at the Knight First Amendment Institute.

When the Supreme Court and lower courts interpret the Constitution and laws, their decrees are public, accessible and subject to debate. In some instances, if an interpretation of the law doesn’t sit well with the public, Congress can respond by amending the law, effectively nullifying a court’s decision. Or if a ruling on a constitutional question is especially egregious, a constitutional amendment, though unlikely, remains an option.

But it turns out there’s a whole category of American law that is above such checks and balances. The public knows nothing about it and there’s no way to challenge it in court, let alone debate it in the halls of Congress.

Story Continued Below

For decades, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has flexed its interpretive power as the ultimate arbiter of what the law is for the executive branch, building a whole body of secret law that remains shielded from public view. Very little is known about these opinions—which carry the force of law, resolve disputes between agencies, direct the conduct of federal officials and can even affect civil rights and liberties. In the view of one scholar, these opinions date “to the beginning of the Republic” and can even “rival the opinions of the Supreme Court.”

These decisions number in the thousands, and the few that become public see the light of day at the discretion of the Justice Department. But the vast majority stay secret—binding executive branch officials and activities across administrations. Because almost everyone who isn’t a lawyer in the office is kept in the dark about these legal conclusions, Congress and the public can’t debate them or seek amendments in the event of abuses. Courts are of no help either.

Indeed, without transparency to test these legal opinions in a court of law or the court of public opinion, it is often the case that the Justice Department has the final say on the actions of federal agencies and officers, and there’s not much anyone can do about it. From Robert Mueller’s decision to follow a 1973 Justice Department recommendation that a president can’t be indicted while in office to numerous pronouncements shielding Donald Trump or officials in his administration from congressional oversight, the Office of Legal Counsel makes law that holds tremendous sway over issues of public concern.

And yet despite the influence of the office’s opinions across the executive branch and their centrality to many of Trump’s controversies, all the public knows about them is the smattering of decisions that are made public from time to time. The Justice Department claims to have the last word over what gets released to the public, subject to a secretive “publication review committee” that calls the shots.

According to one former Justice Department official, in 1991, when Attorney General William Barr first led the Justice Department, the government only published 13 opinions out of an estimated 625 that the Office of Legal Counsel gave to other agencies—a paltry 2 percent that leaves Americans with little understanding of the law that guided the United States’ government at the time.

In 2016, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act to place a 25-year cap on documents previously shielded by what the Justice Department calls “deliberative process privilege”—which the government has cited in the past to keep Office of Legal Counsel’s precedent-setting legal opinions secret. By law, then, that type of privilege should no longer cover such decisions older than 25 years—though some or portions of them may still be kept from disclosure if, for example, they contain classified information. And neither should the department be allowed to claim attorney-client privilege over these opinions, which aren’t legal advice but controlling decisions of law.



With this understanding of the law and with an eye toward greater transparency, a group of scholars last week filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that Office of Legal Counsel memoranda that are at least 25 years old should be disclosed to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Among the plaintiffs are historians of presidential power, the civil rights movement, the laws of war, government surveillance and immigration—all areas where the government’s enormous discretion to enforce the law has been guided by legal judgments that our citizenry would be well served to understand and reckon with, even today. The Justice Department didn’t comply with an earlier administrative request for these opinions.

Understanding past overreach could help us better understand today’s. Barr, then and now, is the kind of attorney general whose expansive views of executive power deserve legal scrutiny—and the public is entitled to know to what extent the Office of Legal Counsel abetted or disregarded his maximalist impulses. More than 25 years ago, he was behind some of the Justice Department’s darkest hours: From a lawless surveillance program he approved that long predated the National Security Agency’s post-9/11 excesses to his role in recommending pardons for officials implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, the American people deserve to know how much secret law he helped create for the presidents he’s served—and how much of it may still be good law for the rest of the executive branch today. For all we know, some of these decisions may have been overruled by later administrations, presidents or attorneys general; the enduring secrecy of these opinions makes it difficult to tell.

Right now, we see these opinions’ weight and opacity playing out. In December, the Trump administration is expected to resume executing federal prisoners on death row, ending a longstanding, de facto moratorium on the federal death penalty. Barr’s decision to reinstate the practice didn’t happen in a vacuum, but was preceded by the advice of the Office of Legal Counsel, which in May concluded in a 26-page memorandum that the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate “drugs” and “devices” used in capital punishment.

That conclusion was squarely at odds with the agency’s prior disapproval of pentobarbital, the drug Barr now wants to use in the upcoming executions. Whatever regulatory roadblocks existed before have been removed. The Office of Legal Counsel has now declared what the law is—at least as far as the executive branch and the FDA are concerned. Unless a court steps in, these executions will move forward with Barr’s new lethal cocktail of choice.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s historical memoranda may not all concern issues of life and death, but they should concern all of us—and the Justice Department would be acting in the national interest if it disclosed them as the law requires."
Ukraine's New Parliament Approves Top Cabinet Officials,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-29/ukraines-new-parliament-approves-top-cabinet-officials,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to newly elected Ukrainian parliament deputies during parliament session in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday urged lawmakers to help liberalize the economy and pursue integration into Europe as the newly-elected parliament swiftly approved his appointees for top government jobs.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian elected president in April, told parliament that the public expects lawmakers to help return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and settle the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Facing a hostile parliament after his landslide victory, Zelenskiy called a snap parliamentary election in July that gave his Servant of the People party the parliament majority. The party takes its name from the popular television sitcom in which Zelenskiy played a high school teacher propelled into the presidency.

Like Zelenskiy, a newcomer in politics, none of the Servant of the People lawmakers have previous experience in parliament. Many Ukrainians, who have grown tired of the old elites they see as corrupt and inefficient, see it as an advantage.

The Verkhovna Rada on Thursday quickly named Oleksiy Honcharuk, 35, as the nation's new prime minister. In his speech in parliament, Honcharuk pledged to focus on encouraging economic growth, raising living standards and combating corruption.

""No one will be allowed to steal in the new government,"" he said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy a star. Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think tank. ""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

Sidenko noted that Honcharuk will face a tough task of introducing unpopular measures that Ukraine's Western investors expect the government to take to shore up the economy.

""The new prime minister will have to do dirty and unpopular work, reducing state subsidies and social assistance as required by the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders,"" Sidenko said.

The lawmakers also quickly approved other Zelenskiy's appointees for top jobs.

Ivan Bakanov, who directed Zelenskiy's campaign, was named the chief of Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU.

Dmytro Razumkov, who served as Zelenskiy's campaign adviser and later became the leader of his party, was elected parliamentary speaker.

The Rada also approved the new foreign minister, Vadim Pristaiko, who previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and later its envoy to NATO.

Speaking to lawmakers, Pristaiko pledged to push for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.

""We need peace and stability,"" he said.

Andriy Zahorodniuk, who was named defense minister, pledged to streamline the military and free it of graft.

""Everyone knows that they steal in the army,"" he said. ""People have grown tired of those problems.""

Two of the members of former President Petro Poroshenko's Cabinet kep their jobs — Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Finance Minister Oksana Markarova.

Myanmar's KBZ Bank hires legal powerhouse Williams & Connolly after holding company was implicated in UN report,https://www.cnbc.com,['Brian Schwartz'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/myanmar-kbz-bank-hires-williams-connolly-for-potential-legal-trouble.html,"One of the most lucrative private banks in Myanmar has hired a legal powerhouse after its holding company was implicated in a scathing United Nations report that blasted the country's military.

Kanbawza Bank has tapped Williams & Connolly, a U.S.-based law firm, to be the company's legal representatives in case U.S. sanctions arise from the U.N.'s fact finding mission. The report accuses Myanmar's military of having ties to a litany of businesses and that those dealings have led to extensive human rights abuses. The U.N. called for a criminal investigation into KBZ Bank's parent company, KBZ Group, for allegedly funding a border fence that has prevented Rohingya Muslims from returning to Myanmar after fleeing the country in 2017.

The firm sent a letter to the bank's CEO, Michael DeNoma, earlier this month and it describes the agreement between the two parties, including a $250,000 retainer.

""Williams & Connolly LLP will provide legal services to you in connection with potential US legal issues and sanctions matters which may arise out of an August 5, 2019 UN Human Rights Council Report on Myanmar,"" David Aufhauser, a partner in the firm, wrote. Aufhauser was previously a managing director and global general counsel at investment bank UBS.

The bank's new hire was discovered after CNBC reviewed foreign lobbying registration forms, with one of the documents describing other responsibilities that may involve having to reach out to members of President Donald Trump's administration, congressional lawmakers and the U.N. itself.

""Additional services will potentially include providing advice regarding legal consequences of the report, providing advice on lobbying and public relations issues related to the representation, lobbying U.S. government officials in the Executive Branch, Congress,and/or the United Nations, and discussing the matter with U.S. or international media organizations,"" the exhibit reads.

The U.N., Aufhauser and KBZ Bank did not return requests for comment.

The effort by KBZ Bank to retain a marquee legal team suggests there are internals fears of severe backlash after the U.N. report, especially from foreign governments such as the U.S. The bank itself has always been held in a high regard around the world.

The Milken Institute, a economic think tank based out of California, described KBZ Bank in a 2017 study as a firm that dominates the Myanmar market.

""Among the privately owned banks, the so-called 'Big Three' dominate the market,"" the study says. ""Combined, Kanbawza Bank (KBZ), Ayeyarwady Bank (AYA), and Co-operative Bank (CB) control about two-thirds of all loans, two-thirds of all deposits, and more than 50 percent of all bank branches in the country.""

Members of the U.N. are scheduled to meet in September for the 74th session of the General Assembly in New York."

US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US is locked in a trade tariff battle with China

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."
Ex-top Mattis aide sues Pentagon over delayed publication of memoir,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-mattis-aide-sues-pentagon-over-delayed-publication-of-memoir,"A top aide to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is suing the Pentagon, alleging it has “unreasonably” delayed the publication of his memoir to benefit Mattis, whose own book is being released next week.

Guy Snodgrass, who served as Mattis’ director of communications and speechwriter, expected to release his memoir, Holding the Line: Inside Trump’s Pentagon with Secretary Mattis, on Oct. 29.

But he has accused the Pentagon of slow-walking the approval of his manuscript and demanding that he redact large portions of unclassified information “with the acquiescence, if not complicity of” Mattis.

“DoD has also implicitly threatened Snodgrass with potential legal and/or administrative retaliation were he to violate alleged loyalty oaths sought by SecDef Mattis that have absolutely no application or lawful effect on him,” the lawsuit says.

Snodgrass said the Pentagon “has deliberately delayed issuing formal and final approval of Snodgrass’ manuscript as a retaliatory and punishing tactic, particularly with the consent and apparent approval of former SecDef Mattis.”

Snodgrass and his lawyers claimed in the lawsuit that “numerous sources” within the Defense Department said the final approval of the manuscript was ""intentionally withheld” to allow Mattis’ book to be published first.

The delay of the manuscript’s approval pushes back the book’s publication and will cause financial harm to Snodgrass, the complaint says.

The lawsuit was filed after the Wall Street Journal published an essay adapted from Mattis’ book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. A day later, The Atlantic published an interview with the former defense secretary. In both accounts, Mattis took swipes at President Trump.

The complaint describes Snodgrass’ book as a “firsthand account” of how Mattis led the military “through global and domestic challenges.”

German Cabinet and Bundesbank Are in Close Communication on CBDC Issues,https://cointelegraph.com,['Helen Partz'],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-cabinet-and-bundesbank-are-in-close-communication-on-cbdc-issues,"The Cabinet of Germany and Germany’s central bank Deutsche Bundesbank are working together closely on issues related to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Awareness of global CBDC situation

On Aug. 29, Germany’s federal parliament (Bundestag) published official feedback to a request from parliamentary group the Free Democratic Party, which asked the Cabinet to respond to six questions related to CBDCs in July 2019.

In the document, dated Aug. 16, the Cabinet answered all questions by the group, citing major reports and surveys in the space, including a January report by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Specifically, when asked about its knowledge or insights about CBDC, the Cabinet cited the BIS, claiming that 70% of global central banks are engaged in CBDC work, but only two have concrete plans to issue digital central bank money.

Status of existing projects: unclear

The Cabinet emphasized that Sweden is the only country in the European Union that is currently considering issuing CBDCs. However, a final decision about CBDC issuance has not been reached, the authority stated. In addition, there are some concrete CBDC plans in Uruguay but shakey pilots have led to uncertainty as to future implementation, the Cabinet wrote.

The authority outlined a similar situation with the Chinese Central Bank that launched a research program on the possible issue of CBDC back in 2014 but is still experiencing a lack of clarity regarding the issue. The Cabinet also cited Venezuela’s Petro (PTR) project, referencing a 2018 Reuters report claiming that there were still no transactions in the oil-backed national cryptocurrency.

In July 2019, the head of Bundesbank Jens Weidmann expressed support for Facebook’s much-discussed crypto project Libra, claiming that global regulators should not suppress the initiative in its infancy."
"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

This came a few months after the Chinese brand was slapped with a trade ban by the White House.

The Commerce Department stated at the time that licenses would be granted to U.S. companies wanting to deal with Huawei, as long as there were no security risks involved. Now, Reuters is reporting that the department has received 130 license applications to sell goods and services to Huawei.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration hasn’t granted any of these applications, the newswire reported, citing three sources.

“Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they’re all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,” former Commerce Department official William Reinsch was also quoted as saying by Reuters.

The news coincides with Google reportedly confirming that the upcoming Huawei Mate 30 series wouldn’t launch with Google apps and services. This suggests that Google may have been one of the many applicants denied by the administration, if it indeed applied to deal with Huawei.

The lack of license approvals will likely put pressure on the company’s other devices too, including its cheaper phones and Matebook line of laptops. Huawei is known to use Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon in some phones, while its Matebook laptops all run on Intel processors, and both companies are U.S. firms.

Trump Jr. said, ""We win this seat, we use it, we keep going forward and win North Carolina in 2020, we're gonna win the presidency.""

Trump Jr. was sounding confident as he spoke to the crowd of supporters gathered at the private campaign event for Murphy.

Murphy says, ""It's great to have the executive branch supporting those of us who are going to be in the legislative branch.""

The campaign stop is one of two Trump Jr. and conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle made in North Carolina Wednesday, both for congressional candidates. The first stop was in Charlotte.

Guilfoyle says, ""We want to make sure that we have winners that are going to support the president and stand shoulder to shoulder with the president.""

The visit to eastern Carolina comes less than two weeks before election day for the 3rd Congressional District seat.

Voters are choosing between Murphy, Democrat Allen Thomas and two third party candidates, to replace the late Congressman, Republican Walter Jones.

Murphy says, ""You know, It's a low turnout, that's what a special election is, but I think folks have really responded to our message.""

Trump Jr. is urging voters to head to the polls and get their friends to do the same, as early voting continues for another week. He says, ""Make sure you turn up. When you do, we win and winning is so much better than losing, right?""

Those who aren't registered to vote in this special election can still do so if you vote early. You will have to bring an ID and a bill with your name and address on in to register. Early voting will continue until September 6th when polls close at 7:00 p.m.

"I've taught US government for 40 years. Thanks to Trump, I'm doubting the Founders' plan.",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Ross K. Baker', 'Opinion Columnist', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/08/30/donald-trump-makes-me-doubt-founders-checks-and-balances-column/2132691001/,"I now hesitate to defend the 'genius' of the Framers. I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances they said would keep us on track.

The day after Labor Day, I will stand behind a lectern in a lecture hall on the campus of Rutgers University and teach a course that I have taught for 40 years. I have always approached the first day eager to teach about the establishment of our republic and how government works today. In the past three years, the eagerness has curdled into apprehension as I debate with myself how even-handed I should be in dealing with a national government that I can no longer recognize, much less approve of.

It would be pointless for me and boring for the students to spend the semester assailing President Donald Trump for casting public service as contemptible with his unjustified disparagement of everyone from scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His contaminating influence has even spread beyond the executive branch to transform the United States Senate, an institution that I have long revered, into a pitiable amen corner that either assents to his most outrageous statements or passively cringes in silence.

Whom did they learn that from?: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.

I am now hesitant defending what I used to refer to as the “genius” of the framers of the Constitution because I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances that James Madison assured us were “auxiliary precautions” to prevent our government from going off the rails at times when the wisdom of the American people is faulty. The faultiness of that wisdom is, in my mind, on vivid display by the man they chose to lead the nation.

Serious flaws in the political system

It is hard for me now, in discussing the voting behavior of Americans, to grasp what kind of desperation prompted so many of my fellow citizens to choose and now enthusiastically support a man who has degraded the office of the presidency. How can American citizens in whom sovereignty resides have acted so irresponsibly? I will grant, however, that the alternative was not a good one. But that also speaks to serious flaws in the system.

I have searched for historical examples to reassure the students, and myself, that we have sometimes made poor choices in the men we have elected president, but that the damage that they inflicted on the country was slight and things turned out all right. I find it harder these days to use these historical examples, because they were part of a different time in which partisan strife was not so intractable and there were individuals who enjoyed universal respect to whom we could turn to help right the ship. Recently, people looked hopefully on the the prospect of William Barr as attorney general — another Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus perhaps — only to see him mutate into a stooge for the president.

More distressing even than lacking good people to restore the nation such as in the aftermath of Watergate and Richard Nixon’s resignation has been the failure of those exiting the Trump administration to speak openly about the mismanagement, capriciousness and venality of the president and his entourage.

Many individuals who spoke privately about Trump’s ignorance and caprice, such as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, slunk silently into retirement without getting on the record their obvious contempt for Trump. Even the vaunted truth-teller Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose departure was attributed to policy differences with the president, has not aired those differences so that the public could be able to evaluate whose version was the more credible.

Pulling my punches on Trump

Few of our past presidents were wholly conversant with constitutional law, but most seemed to be wary of the electrified wires of the system of separation of powers that defined limits they dared not transgress. Attributing to President Trump the most innocent interpretation of his abuses of power, such as the recent order to American companies to leave China, he has been exposed as a constitutional imbecile.

Just for the looks: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too.

More ominously, he is a man with dictatorial tendencies that exceed even of those past presidents most contemptuous of checks and balances. He has elevated the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership to a level above that of the First Amendment’s protection against the abridgment of a free press, and he tampers dangerously with the 14th Amendment’s clear message on birthright citizenship.

Ultimately, I will probably pull my punches because I don’t want to come across as a scold, and I will temper my words because I don’t want to give my students the idea that all is lost. It would be truly be the worst message of all.

U.S. weekly jobless claims increase slightly,https://kfgo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/29/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-slightly/932105/,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.

Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.

But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.

According to economists at JPMorgan, this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.

Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.

For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%.

"UGA SGA discusses new initiative, transportation concerns in cabinet meeting",https://www.redandblack.com,"['Megan Mittelhammer', 'Digital Producer', 'Sam Perez', 'Savannah Sicurella', 'Campus News Editor', 'Hunter Riggall', 'News Editor']",,,,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-sga-discusses-new-initiative-transportation-concerns-in-cabinet-meeting/article_e43feb56-cad9-11e9-bd43-8f5744342772.html,"Transportation, homecoming court and public forum discussions were all on the docket for Tuesday night’s University of Georgia Student Government Association Executive Cabinet meeting.

SGA Vice President Melissa Hevener started off the meeting with a general explanation of Senate meetings.

“SGA recognizes Senate as an open public forum. That means technically any student can come and attend senate because we are being held accountable by the student body through that mechanism,” she said.

Hevener explained that it is the student body’s responsibility to come to SGA members and voice their concerns, but it is additionally the representatives' duty to respond to their needs.

Next on the docket were “housekeeping” topics, including homecoming court nominations and the First-Year Connect mentor program. SGA Executive Cabinet Chief of Staff Hayden Kolodziejcyk explained the details of what was expected.

Hevener discussed plans for The Georgia Way, a new initiative designed to create an honor code for the student body that will help “to ensure that we are holding ourselves to certain community standards that may not be enforceable.”

As an organization, SGA wants every member of the community to feel valued, Hevener said. Concerning The Georgia Way, members are responsible for “pushing out this idea that as a student body, we stand behind these ideals of respect, honesty and integrity.”

The Georgia Way will accumulate to a week of programming in November after an initial planning meeting for members in mid-September. SGA will be designing the creed in a way that is inclusive of the student body as a whole. In an effort to represent the campus, Heavener encouraged members to use their voices to interact with as many student organizations on campus as possible so students feel that their voices matter.

President Rachel Byers opened the floor to an open discussion where members had an opportunity to express concerns they have heard from other students around campus. The most pressing issue was transportation complications.

Specifically, students discussed the UGA bus system and its effectiveness. Many members weighed in on the issue of overcrowding at bus stops, especially at the East Campus Village stop.

Hevener addressed concerns and said she, along with Byers and SGA Treasurer Nav Singh, have already met with UGA Transportation and Parking Services to discuss the issue.

Hevener said the housing of first-year students in the University Village graduate apartments has led the university to anticipate overcrowding in East Campus residence halls. According to Hevener, alterations were made to the stops and bus routes to make the bus system more efficient.

Byers added that UGA TPS mentioned making a change to the bus stop by Ramsey Student Center. While she said that option had been discussed, no official plans have been announced.

SGA will hold an open forum discussion for all students to attend on Tuesday, Sept. 3. The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Miller Learning Center."
The Ho-Chunk Nation Executive Branch Aims to be single-use plastic and Styrofoam free in one year,https://www.weau.com,['Hayley Spitler'],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/The-Ho-Chunk-Nation-Executive-Branch-Aims-to-be-single-use-plastic-and-Styrofoam-free-in-one-year-558847741.html,"The Ho-Chunk Nation president, in Black River Falls, has signed a proclamation calling for a reduction of single-use plastics and Styrofoam throughout the executive branch.

Marlon WhiteEagle, now in his 8th week as president, says his decision reflects the desire of the Ho-Chunk Nation.

""I'm paying close attention to what they're saying, how they feel, what's important to them,"" said WhiteEagle. ""I just want to carry their priorities forward... through the government.""

He believes there are several benefits to going Styrofoam and single-use plastic free.

""We're really kind of going in and looking to see how we can save money, but still be environmentally friendly,"" WhiteEagle said.

The Ho-Chunk Nation government is made up of four branches: the general counsel, the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch.

While the proclamation only affects the executive branch, WhiteEagle says he hopes it inspires other areas of the Nation to make a similar change.

""I'm hoping that through doing this, the other branches will fall in suit with us and if other tribes see it, that they would consider doing something similar,"" WhiteEagle said.

The goal is to not only inspire change throughout the Nation, but that this proclamation also helps the Ho-Chunk people leave the mark that they want to.

""We want to build a legacy that we're not so wasteful and harmful to the environment,"" said WhiteEagle. ""Any opportunity we have to help with the environment, whether its partnerships with local and county governments, state governments, federal government, we will look to those opportunities and jump on board.""

Each facility director or executive branch manager now has one month to put together a plan of how they can reduce it.

WhiteEagle hopes to have the branch Styrofoam and single-use plastic free in one year."

"Nigeria's Buhari Assigns Cabinet Portfolios, Appoints New Oil Minister",https://www.usnews.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-21/nigerias-buhari-assigns-cabinet-portfolios-appoints-timipre-silva-oil-minister,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari poses with his new cabinet for a photo, after a swearing-in ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria, August 21, 2019. Nigeria Presidency/Handout via REUTERS Reuters

By Felix Onuah

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa's top producer of crude oil.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country's main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa's biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria's emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

""The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,"" Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country's ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

""We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February's election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party's base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

""There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,"" said Liewerscheidt.

Official: Kentucky Cabinet fails to secure coal worker bonds | Tacoma News Tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com,"['The Associated Press', 'Dave Skretta', 'Ap Sports Writer']",,,,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article234520787.html,"The state's Labor Cabinet hasn't secured the necessary bonds from coal companies that would cover wage payments to miners if their employer unexpectedly shuts down, Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear said.

Beshear, a Democrat running for governor, announced on Thursday that his office examined records of Kentucky companies that should be required to pay the bonds. State law requires construction and mineral companies in business for less than five years to pay performance bonds that would cover four weeks of employee pay. Beshear says 1,000 miners are working for coal companies that haven't paid the bond.

Some Kentucky miners were left with bounced paychecks after one coal company, Milton, West Virginia-based Blackjewel, filed for bankruptcy on July 1. Some of those miners are protesting the lack of payments by blocking a coal shipment sitting on railroad tracks in Harlan County.

A Labor Cabinet spokeswoman said the ""full force"" of the Cabinet has been directed toward recovering wages for the Blackjewel miners.

""It's curious that the Attorney General is just now weighing in with his after-the-fact advice,"" Mary Elizabeth Robertson said in a statement. Robertson said the attorney general's office should have worked on adding reporting requirements to the state law to give the Cabinet ""the tools it needed to identify non-compliance and enforce the requirement.""

Beshear said he is concerned that the Labor Cabinet acted intentionally to ignore the law. He pointed out that Labor Cabinet officials were in support of a bill before the General Assembly last year that would have done away with the bond requirement.

""And that intentional decision to ignore the law has created the situation these Blackjewel miners are in, and that others could fall into,"" he said.

A report released Thursday by the attorney general's office said at least 30 mining companies may not have paid the bond, as required by the law passed in 2010. The law says ""any employee whose wages are secured by a bond may obtain payment of those wages, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees.""

Gov. Matt Bevin announced in July that the Labor Cabinet would investigate the lost wages of the Blackjewel miners. The Cabinet said the company sent bounced checks to its workers."

He Is An Emeritus Professor Of Constitutional Law At American University S Washington College Of Law.']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/28/whats-trumps-idea-america-first-g-cash-flowing-his-golf-resort/,"

President Trump speaks at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Monday. (Markus Schreiber/AP)

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. He is an emeritus professor of constitutional law at American University’s Washington College of Law.

President Trump thinks he has found the perfect site for the 2020 Group of Seven summit: the Trump National Doral golf resort. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it,” he said from this year’s G-7 gathering in France.

His choice wasn’t exactly astonishing, considering that since he took office, Trump has visited his business properties at taxpayer expense 362 times; there have been 630 visits to Trump properties by at least 250 Trump administration officials, including White House staff members, Cabinet members and agency employees; and visits to Trump properties have been made by 111 officials representing 65 foreign governments, all according to a report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

[Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.]

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

[Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.]

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."

Nadler to probe Trump's G-7 resort pitch,https://thehill.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/459187-nadler-to-probe-trump-proposal-to-host-2020-g-7-summit-at-trump-owned-property,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerHouse Democrats blur lines on support for impeachment Poll: Majority wants Trump out, but not through impeachment Second Democrat representing Trump district backs impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.) announced Wednesday his panel will broaden its investigation into President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump to host Kuwait's leader at White House in September West Virginia governor poll: Manchin leads GOP incumbent Justice by 10 points US service member killed in combat in Afghanistan MORE to include his proposal to hold the 2020 Group of Seven (G-7) summit at one of his family-owned properties in Florida.

Nadler said the president's pitch to host next year's meeting of world leaders at Trump National Doral Miami is ""only the latest in a troubling pattern of corruption and self-dealing by the President"" and may violate both the foreign and domestic Emoluments Clauses.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The President’s personal financial interests are clearly shaping decisions about official U.S. government activities, and this is precisely the type of risk that the Constitution’s Emoluments Clauses were intended to prevent,"" Nadler said in a statement.

""More importantly, the Doral decision reflects perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay President Trump’s private businesses in order to conduct business with the United States,"" Nadler added.

Trump has publicly defended his resort as top contender for the next G-7 meeting, calling it a “natural” location because of its proximity to a major airport.

“Doral happens to be within Miami. It’s a city, it’s a wonderful place. It’s a very, very successful area of Florida,"" Trump told reporters at a press conference Monday at the conclusion of this year's G-7 summit, held in Biarritz, France. ""It’s very importantly only five minutes from the airport – the airport is right next door. It’s a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world.""

The president has insisted he was not trying to boost his own properties.

""With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like such a natural,"" Trump said. ""Each country can have their own villa or their own bungalow, and they have a lot of units in them, so I think it just works out well.""

The Emoluments Clause bars presidents from accepting gifts or other benefits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval.

Foreign and domestic government officials have frequently stayed at Trump-owned hotels and properties, prompting critics to argue Trump is benefitting financially from his role as president while in office.

Nadler, who is already leading a sprawling investigation examining allegations of obstruction of justice, public corruption and other abuses of power, said the Doral probe would be wrapped into the broader one.

""The Constitution demands that President Trump’s private interests and official conduct remain separate, and this latest announcement demands scrutiny by Congress,"" Nadler said.

""Potential violations of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution are of significant interest and grave concern to the Committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment,"" he added. ""The Committee will broaden its ongoing investigation to include these latest revelations and will take further investigative steps, including scheduling hearings and requesting additional documents from the White House.""

"Judge questions Labor Cabinet's declaration that more than 1,000 teachers broke the law",https://www.courier-journal.com,"['Tom Loftus', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/19/kentucky-teacher-sickouts-judge-questions-labor-cabinets-decision/2049282001/,"CLOSE

FRANKFORT — Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd on Monday questioned the process that led Kentucky Labor Secretary David Dickerson to declare last week that more than 1,000 teachers had broken the law by participating in this year's ""sickout"" protests.

""It's kind of a remarkable thing that a cabinet secretary would make a public finding — a thousand citizens had violated the law — without any kind of hearing, without any kind notice, without any kind of opportunity for the people who are alleged to have violated the law to respond to it,"" Shepherd said.

Shepherd made the comments during a hearing in Attorney General Andy Beshear's lawsuit challenging the cabinet's authority to investigate what the cabinet's statement on Friday called an ""illegal work stoppage.""

The cabinet's Friday announcement said the investigation determined 1,074 teachers broke the law, but they will not be fined for their actions.

Steve Pitt, general counsel for Gov. Matt Bevin's office, argued that Dickerson did act within his authority and did not violate the due process rights of teachers with the statement released Friday.

Pitt said the due process rights of teachers would be an issue if they had been individually cited and denied the chance to challenge a citation.

""That didn't happen,"" Pitt said.

Background: Labor Cabinet says 1,074 teachers broke the law, won't be fined

Shepherd, who made no major ruling in the case Monday, still seemed troubled by the cabinet's statement. ""To have the head of the agency make such a public accusation here that a thousand people are law violators seems to me to implicate some due process concerns,"" he said.

Monday's status hearing on the case was scheduled by the judge prior to Friday's cabinet announcement.

Pitt said the cabinet's announcement Friday of final action in the investigation renders the case moot.

But J. Michael Brown, the deputy attorney general, said the legal question of whether Dickerson has the power to pursue this type of investigation still must be addressed by the courts.

""The Labor Cabinet does not have the jurisdiction necessary to carry out the actions that it sought to do in this case because nowhere has it been established that there was ever a strike or a work stoppage as it's understood to be in Kentucky law,"" Brown said.

Ten Kentucky school districts shut down for one or more days in early 2019 when teachers flocked to Frankfort to protest certain bills under consideration by the Kentucky General Assembly. Jefferson County Public Schools, the state's largest district, closed its doors to students six time between late February and mid-March.

The Labor Cabinet launched its investigation into the sickout protests in April, issuing subpoenas to each of the 10 districts for names of all teachers who called in sick during the days the schools closed down.

Dickerson said at the time he did not dispute teachers' right to protest. But he said teachers did not have a right to lie about being sick in order to shut down a school — an act he deemed an ""illegal work stoppage.""

Shepherd also questioned Monday whether the controversy is over, because Dickerson warned in Friday's announcement that the cabinet will press forward with its authority to cite and fine teachers $1,000 if ""proven violations"" are found in the future.

Pitt argued the cabinet's investigation is over, and said it's impossible to know whether sickouts will occur during the 2020 legislative session over bills that have yet to be filed.

Shepherd gave Pitt an early September deadline to file arguments on why he believes the case should be dismissed.

Halep ‘not inspired at all’ in US Open defeat,https://www.malaymail.com,[],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2019/08/30/halep-not-inspired-at-all-in-us-open-defeat/1785695,"Simona Halep of Romania reacts against Taylor Townsend of the US during their Women’s Singles second-round match at the 2019 US Open in New York August 29, 2019. — AFP pic

NEW YORK, Aug 30 — Simona Halep said she was “not inspired at all” in yesterday’s US Open loss to 116th-ranked American qualifier Taylor Townsend as her miserable run in New York continued.

The reigning Wimbledon champion saved a pair of match points but then failed to convert one in the final set of a 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) defeat.

“I was not inspired at all today, but I fought. I thought when I came back that I will take it and I will win it. But sometimes it goes the other way,” Halep said, digesting another early Flushing Meadows exit following first-round losses in 2017 and 2018.

“I’m used to it. It’s the third year. I’m disappointed. I had expectations from myself that I’m confident and I feel the game. But today was different. I was very close. I had match ball. But, you know, sometimes it happens.

“She played really well. She really deserved to win it because she gave everything and she didn’t think of losing. She went all the way with 100 percent belief.”

Fourth seed Halep, whose best US Open run came when she reached the semi-finals in 2015, admitted she struggled to cope with Townsend’s committed serve-and-volley approach.

“Never, never. I never played with someone coming so often to the net,” Halep said.

“She was way more inspired than me. Many balls I hit on the sides, she was there. That’s why I say I was not inspired. I played all the time where she was.”

Halep had not dropped a set in three previous meeting with Townsend, whose victory over the Romanian represented her first over a top-10 player.

The most recent of those clashes came last March in Miami, where Halep imparted some friendly advice to Townsend after she inflicted a 6-1, 6-3 defeat on her.

“After we played together, she came in the locker room and she asked me what she has to improve to be better. So she did it today,” Halep said, with a wry smile. “Next time I will not say anything.

“I played few times against her, and I knew how she’s playing,” she added.

“But today she changed. She went for all the balls to the net. So it was a little bit different. At one point I lost the rhythm in the second set, and I didn’t really know what I have to change. Even the touch, I didn’t have it.

“But always when you play with a top player, you have nothing to lose.” — AFP"

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)

Taking their cue from red states that regularly banded together to sue the Obama administration, Democratic attorneys general began challenging the Trump administration in court the first month President Trump took office, starting with the travel ban.

The litigation by coalition has continued unabated, with at least six multistate lawsuits filed against Trump policies in August alone, most prominently against the president’s attempt to deny green cards and visa extensions to foreign nationals seeking public assistance.

Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."

Re: “Former governor considers Senate run,” Aug. 14 news story

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Epstein’s fate

I am not a believer in an afterlife, but in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, I’ll make an exception. There should be no escape. Guilt, shame and penitence for eternity seems fair.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.
