Joaquin Castro outed his own donors in bid to shame Trump supporters,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joaquin-castro-outed-one-of-his-own-donors-in-bid-to-shame-trump-supporters,"EXCLUSIVE: Trump donors whose names and employers were posted in a highly controversial tweet by Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro blasted the Texas congressman on Wednesday for what they described as a “ridiculous” stunt and, in interviews with Fox News, rejected his claim that they are “fueling a campaign of hate” against Hispanics.

One of those Trump donors even revealed he's also been a supporter of local Democratic lawmakers—including Castro himself.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN BLASTS DEM REP FOR TRYING TO NAME AND SHAME DONORS: 'DELETE & APOLOGIZE'

Wayne Harwell, the owner of a local real estate development company whose name appeared on the list Castro shared on Monday night, told Fox News in a phone interview that he donated money to Castro’s congressional campaign. But he suggested that after Castro outed him in a bid to shame Trump supporters, he won't be supporting Castro anymore.

“I was also on a list of people that gave to Castro and if he dislikes me enough that he wants to put my name out there against Trump, I’m not going to give money to him,” Harwell told Fox News. “Obviously Castro feels pretty strongly against me.”

According to Federal Election Commission records, Harwell donated $1,000 to Castro’s campaign in September 2011.

“I’m pretty independent, but I support Trump,” Harwell explained.

Harwell’s name appeared on a list, along with 43 other prominent donors in San Antonio who have contributed to President Trump. This year, Harwell contributed a total of $5,600 to the Trump Victory committee, and $2,800 to the Trump campaign. Harwell also donated to Trump’s campaign during his first presidential run in 2016.

That list was posted on Twitter by Castro, who is the campaign chairman for his brother, 2020 presidential hopeful Julian Castro. The Texas congressman sought to link them to a ""campaign of hate"" in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton.

“Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump,"" Castro tweeted. “Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders.’”

Harwell rejected the allegation.

“I think some of the Democratic rhetoric is more hateful than some of Trump’s rhetoric,” he said. “I think the San Antonio community needs to take a real deep look at what Castro is doing. Why is he doing this?”

He added: “If he wants to play in Washington, he needs to move to Washington. If he wants to play in San Antonio, he needs to at least be sensitive. The rest of the community is sensitive. We’re sensitive to both Republican and Democrat views. A lot of us here in San Antonio are independents.”

Harwell said Castro was drawing “hard lines,” and said that was “not helpful.”

“I hope his constituents remember this,” Harwell said.

Another individual on the list, William Greehey, also gave thousands of dollars to Castro during his first two campaigns, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Meanwhile, a local oil business owner and executive, Justin Herricks, whose name was also on Castro’s list, called the tactic “ridiculous.”

WHITE HOUSE SLAMS DEMS FOR MAKING SHOOTINGS ABOUT TRUMP

“As a country, as a whole, we’ve got much bigger issues than trying to fight amongst ourselves,” Herricks told Fox News in a phone interview.

“I feel pretty good about what I’ve done, and who I support,” he said. “Everybody else is pretty open with what they believe in on the other side, so why can’t I? What’s the problem?”

Herricks donated $2,800 to Trump’s re-election campaign this year, and $15,000 to the Trump Victory committee.

Herricks went on to deny Castro’s claims that Trump donors are complicit in spreading hateful rhetoric against Hispanics.

“Probably a good 50 to 70 percent of my employment is Mexican people,” Herricks said. “You can’t have that argument.”

He added: “Everyone on that list, I would be safe to say, has done way more for Hispanic people than Castro ever has thought of doing. I don’t know the guy, but how many employees does he have compared to all of the people on the list?”

Herricks referenced Bill Miller Bar-B-Q—a local restaurant that Castro featured in his tweet. “Bill Millers—it has a huge Mexican heritage,” Herricks said. “If you go to any Bill Millers in San Antonio—Hispanics are his staff. How can you say that when he employs so many of them?”

Yet after the congressman tagged the restaurant’s Twitter handle in his original post, it faced a social media backlash, with some users vowing to boycott the restaurant.

One user tweeted a gif that said: ""Don't support Trump's racism or Sh**ty BBQ.""

Other Twitter users, though, said that they would proudly eat at the restaurants.

Miller, who owns 74 locations in San Antonio, declined to comment to Fox News.

Another Trump donor who appeared on the list, Mark Hanrahan, CEO of MidAmerican Aerospace, voiced similar concerns.

""Castro's tweet shows how out of bounds people are going now,"" Hanrahan said in an interview with Fox News. ""People are confusing my right to support a candidate with racism and it's totally wrong. Castro is a demagogue.""

TRUMP CONDEMNS WHITE SUPREMACY, CALLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN REFORMS AFTER SHOOTINGS

Meanwhile, Republicans, including the Trump campaign, blasted Castro and accused him of “targeting” private citizens. The Trump campaign told Fox News late Tuesday that they reported Castro’s tweet to Twitter, arguing it violates the platform’s abusive behavior provision stating users cannot “engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so.”

It is unclear at this point who originally compiled the list of donors that Castro tweeted out late Monday.

Castro did not respond to Fox News’ multiple requests for comment, but tweeted Tuesday night that he would “love to have a conversation with @Twitter and @Facebook about how I use their platforms versus how the President uses them.”

Castro also defended himself in response to criticism from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who tweeted that the Texas Democrat's post was ""shameful and dangerous.""

""No one was targeted or harassed in my post. You know that,"" Castro said in response to McCarthy. ""All that info is routinely published. You’re trying to distract from the racism that has overtaken the GOP and the fact that President Trump spends donor money on thousands of ads about Hispanics 'invading' America.

""Donald Trump has put a target on the back of millions,"" Castro went on. ""And you’re too cowardly or agreeable to say anything about it. How about I stop mentioning Trump’s public campaign donors and he stops using their money for ads that fuel hate?""

In an interview Wednesday on MSNBC, he said he did not want to see anyone ""harassed.""

Castro's tweet comes as 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are criticizing President Trump's rhetoric, and even branding him a racist, in the wake of last weekend's back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead.

Castro's brother, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, also slammed the president, saying he has embraced ""division and bigotry"" and is ""fanning the flames of hate"" as a form of ""political strategy.""

Julian Castro did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on his brother's tweet.

The White House hit back earlier Tuesday.

“There is a huge difference ... between running your mouth and running for president, and being the president and trying to bring together a nation,” Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox & Friends."" “The president did not respond in kind. They politicized this over the weekend.”

Investors try to figure out Trump's trade war endgame: 'I can't even tell you what victory is',https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Cox'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/investors-try-to-figure-out-trumps-trade-war-endgame-i-cant-even-tell-you-what-victory-is.html,"President Donald Trump's trade war comes with an aggressive and clear-cut strategy but a fuzzy endgame, namely that it's unclear just what victory would look like. True, there are lofty ambitions: a world without tariffs, a ""level playing field"" with China where goods would flow freely between the two nations, and the promise of untethered growth thanks to the opening of new markets and the end to the theft of intellectual property. But what that really would mean for the economy is squishy. Would there truly be a stronger U.S. or just a weakened China? If American companies had full access to Chinese markets, would there really be that much to gain? And what are the costs between here and there? In a CNBC interview Tuesday, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow somewhat quantified what the White House is looking for as it cranks up the trade tensions with China and looks for an agreement it deems favorable to U.S. interests.

""The president has said numerous times his ultimate goal with respect to the world trading system is zero tariffs, zero non-tariff trading barriers and zero subsidies,"" said Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. ""There are considerable benefits to truly free and lawful trading. There are consumer benefits and business benefits on both sides.""

'You have to be strategic'

In raw numbers, Kudlow tossed out a dollar figure of $600 billion ""if we were able to reclaim what we have lost"" in intellectual property theft. The number likely came from an oft-cited 2017 estimate from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, which put the price tag in the $225 billion to $600 billion range. ""The president is a transformative president. He's rebuilding the American economy and we've had some considerable success. These things are not easy, and that includes trade imbalances,"" Kudlow added. ""So what we're trying to do is have fair, freer, reciprocal trading with China."" What that looks like, though, is anybody's guess. Trade uncertainty already has cut a swath across the U.S. financial landscape. Corporate earnings have wobbled as multinationals watch their profits fall away due to higher costs and upset supply chains, while Wall Street has sustained a rough patch of volatility that has sent the major stock market averages off nearly 5% apiece over the past month. Trump, meanwhile, continues to hammer away at China without ever specifically delineating what the results could be after he gets his deal. He's frequently promised an economy that would grow well in excess of 3% a year, but the tariffs thus far have only acted as a drag. ""If you want to be successful, you have to be strategic,"" Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. ""Be very clear what the point is, how you want to get it, what is the victory. Because the fact is, you're asking this question and I can't even tell you what victory is.""

Despite a generally positive view on the Trump economy, the president has not enjoyed as much favor on the trade war. A recent Quinnipiac University national poll showed that while 71% viewed the economy as in either excellent or good shape, just 40% approved of Trump's trade policies, while 48% opposed. Business leaders also have voiced concerns, as earnings conference calls have been filled with CEOs bracing for tariff fallout. ""It's really about putting some of the things he broke back together again,"" Blitz said. ""His heart is in the right place, but the execution is proving somewhat clumsy. We've lost the narrative of the final objective. Because how do you know you've gotten free trade?"" Tariffs are hurting China, and at least theoretically the U.S. could change supply chains and push China to the periphery of world commerce, as in the Maoist era. However, that still wouldn't guarantee a free-trade environment that would take U.S. growth to another level. ""You're creating a disruption, but all you're really doing is potentially weakening the Chinese economy,"" Blitz said. ""But to what effect? It's a good question.""

Pain before gain

For business owners with interests in China, there are some clear objectives: to not have the Chinese force U.S companies to transfer their technology secrets, a more equal tariff structure and the ability, without government interference, to expand their operations. ""I need the end game with this administration to end up with access to the Chinese market and protection of my IP,"" Kevin O'Leary, an investor, business owner and star of ""Shark Tank,"" told CNBC. ""Those are two things I want, and until we get that I don't care how much soybeans they buy, it's irrelevant. What we need is a level playing field."" O'Leary said that if the impasse is settled in a positive way, he'll be investing heavily, launching ""at least"" 30 products and hiring ""hundreds of people"" to expand lines. He also said there will be big benefits for the stock market."

From suspending U.S. agricultural product purchases to weaponizing the yuan, these high-stakes measures, which could put Chinese businesses at risk, are a preview of how far China could be willing to go economically to get a long-term deal in its favor.

""Many investors have expressed the view that China is prepared to accept an economic downturn (and thus a global economic downturn) to prevent President Trump's reelection,"" Naka Matsuzawa, Nomura's chief rates strategist in Tokyo, said in a note on Wednesday following meetings with Asian clients."

The GOP has caught autocratic fever,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'August At Am']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/07/gop-has-caught-autocratic-fever/,"Five years ago, congressional Republicans blasted President Barack Obama as “Emperor Obama” and compared him to a king for his executive actions, most notably those protecting some undocumented immigrants. Ten years ago, conservative activists launched the tea party movement in large part as a call for a more limited federal government.

Today, conservative Republicans have moved sharply toward embracing a more powerful chief executive with fewer checks and balances.

A new Pew Research Center poll, in fact, finds that a majority of conservative Republicans (52 percent) agree that many problems would be solved “if U.S. presidents didn’t have to worry so much about Congress or the courts.” That number has doubled since last year (26 percent) and quadrupled from when Barack Obama was president in 2016 (13 percent).

Today, just 41 percent choose the other option, that it “would be too risky to give U.S. presidents more power” to confront problems.



via Pew Research Center (Pew Research Center/Pew Research Center)

Among the broader group of all Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, the numbers have also risen substantially in recent years. Just 14 percent favored fewer checks on the president in 2016. That number rose to around one-quarter in Trump’s first year-plus, and today it’s 43 percent of all Republicans.

And it’s not just a matter of partisanship either. It’s normal for a party to favor presidential powers more when it holds the office, but the shift among Republicans is considerably bigger than among Democrats. While the share of Republican-leaning voters favoring a more powerful executive has risen 29 points between 2016 and 2019, the corresponding drop among Democratic-leaning voters who favor that approach has been just 13 points, from 29 percent in Obama’s last year to 16 percent today.



via Pew Research Center (Pew Research Center/Pew Research Center)

(It’s possible being close to the 2016 election might have reined in support among Democrats for the proposition, given that could mean the more-powerful executive could soon be Trump. But this was still at a time when the vast majority of people — and especially Democrats — expected Hillary Clinton to be the next president.)

It’s difficult to separate this new poll finding from what has transpired over the entirety of the Trump presidency. Trump has sought to stretch his presidential powers to distances not even broached by Obama — including by using a national emergency declaration to build a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border — and along the way he has run into a series of adverse court decisions. Many of these decisions were momentary and/or came in particularly unfavorable jurisdictions. But the setbacks have also included a number of instances in which the administration simply didn’t make a valid defense of the change, including recently when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority blocked the 2020 Census citizenship question.

When met with such decisions, Trump has often attacked the judges behind them, regularly labeling them “Obama judges” and the like. His comments about judges in 2017 even earned him a rebuke from his then-Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch.

Trump has also been stymied by Congress, even though Republicans controlled it for his first two years. The GOP passed tax cuts but was unable to repeal and replace Obamacare, thanks to defections from its own members, including the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). As with the judges, Trump hasn’t held back in criticizing McCain, even continuing that criticism following McCain’s death.

Against that backdrop, perhaps it’s not surprising that Republicans view Congress and the courts as an impediment to the policy proposals they and Trump want. Obama occasionally decried the broken Congress and even criticized Supreme Court justices in a State of the Union address, but he didn’t ever go as far as Trump has.

A more sinister read, of course, would be that Republicans have warmed to a more autocratic type of leader given Trump’s regular praise and admiration for strongmen around the world. Whatever the case, it’s clear there has been a significant shift — not the kind that suggests the American people would sign off on a dictator, certainly, but one in which one of the two major parties has significantly less regard (or desire) for the checks and balances the Founding Fathers created."
Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-trump-1637094,"Data from Mike Pompeo’s State Department data suggests Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the Trump administration’s public charge regulation. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo employment & immigration Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department The numbers offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system.

The number of Mexicans refused immigrant visas to the U.S. because they might become dependent on government benefits skyrocketed under President Donald Trump, according to State Department data obtained by POLITICO.

Between Oct. 1 and July 29, the State Department denied 5,343 immigrant visa applications for Mexican nationals on the grounds that the applicants were so poor or infirm that they risked becoming a “public charge,” according to the statistics. That’s up from just seven denials for Mexican applicants in fiscal year 2016, the last full year under former President Barack Obama.

Story Continued Below

The number of public charge denials for applicants from all nations also rose during the past year. Preliminary data obtained by POLITICO shows 12,179 visa rejections on public charge grounds through July 29 — which puts the department on pace to surpass last year’s total. The State Department disqualified only 1,033 people on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016.

Public charge denials have increased in recent years as the State Department has issued fewer immigrant visas overall. Immigrant visas are the first step toward permanent residence in the U.S.

Consular officers approved roughly 534,000 immigrant visas in fiscal year 2018, down from 618,000 two years earlier.

Refused visa applicants are permitted to submit additional evidence to prove their economic self-sufficiency, but the statistics show that only 1,330 Mexican immigrants who applied in previous years reversed a public charge ruling during that period.

Applicants from various other countries — including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti and the Dominican Republic — also saw dramatic increases in denials attributed to the risk that they would consume government benefits.

The State Department statistics offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system. Under the regulation, which is expected to be finalized in the coming days, DHS will adopt a more aggressive public charge analysis to evaluate applications for green cards and visa renewals.

Under the DHS rule, consideration would be given not only to whether an applicant was so poor that they were likely to receive certain U.S. government benefits, but also to whether the applicant received these benefits already.

“It is imposing a tougher standard for working-class people,” said Charles Wheeler, a director with the pro-migrant Catholic Legal Immigration Network.

Wheeler added that the regulation mirrors Trump’s efforts to pass legislation that would reduce legal immigration and favor skilled workers over immigrants with family connections. A Trump-backed Senate bill along those lines drew few supporters in 2017.

The State Department data suggests that Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the public charge regulation. Trump has faced Democratic criticism in recent days over his anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric following a mass shooting in El Paso that killed 22 people, including eight Mexican citizens. Authorities have investigated whether the suspect posted a racist manifesto online that warned of a “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” The language echoed Trump’s own repeated comments about an immigrant “invasion” at the southwest border.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/a8/31/34cb22964e9a9e8e68ceb0de44ae/dems-guncontrol.png"" true

The State Department visa denials were based on statutory language dating to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act (later reaffirmed in 1952 in the Red Scare-inspired McCarren-Walter Act) that says immigrants and visitors to the United States can be turned away if they’re likely to become a public charge after admission. The phrase ""public charge"" isn’t defined in the relevant statutes, but guidance issued in 1999 said it applied to people who were primarily dependent — or likely to become primarily dependent — on cash assistance or long-term, institutionalized care.

The Trump administration is expected to finalize a regulation in the coming days that would expand that definition.

Based on a proposed version released in October, the new standard would consider the use of food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, prescription drug subsidies or Section 8 housing vouchers to make a public charge determination. Immigrants could be denied green cards based on the use of those benefits, or if they were deemed likely to use them in the future.

DHS calculated at the time that roughly 382,000 people seeking to become lawful permanent residents could be subjected to a public charge review each year. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimated that an additional 559,000 people annually could be scrutinized on public charge grounds when applying for immigrant visas from consulates abroad.

People with temporary visas could also be denied for possible benefit use. DHS said in its draft regulation that roughly 518,000 foreigners with non-immigrant visas seeking to extend their stay each year would be required to demonstrate that they haven’t received benefits.

Pro-migrant advocates argue the measure’s reach will be broader, partly because of a chilling effect on immigrant families.

Even while the DHS public charge regulation remained under development, the State Department forged ahead last year with related changes to its public charge standard.

In January 2018, the department revised its Foreign Affairs Manual — which is known to consular officers as the “FAM” — to toughen the guidelines around what triggers a public charge determination for immigrant visa applicants overseas.

Immigration: DACA Illegal Entry The Wall

Specifically, the department reduced the weight of an affidavit of support that many U.S. sponsors must provide to demonstrate that an applicant will not become a taxpayer burden. The new guidance stated that the affidavit should be considered only one factor in a broader test to determine whether a person might use cash assistance or require long-term, institutionalized care.

An affidavit of support previously would have been sufficient to override most public charge determinations, according to immigration lawyers and advocates. But the changes gave a “green light” to State Department officials with more restrictionist views, according to David Strashnoy, a former State Department consular officer.

“It basically opens the door for all sorts of egregious decision-making,” he said.

Following the revision, the number of visa denials based on public charge grounds spiked.

The State Department rejected 12,973 immigrant visa applications over public charge concerns in fiscal 2018, according to the latest statistics. The department turned down just 3,209 applications on those grounds in fiscal 2017 and a mere 1,033 in fiscal 2016.

The 2018 changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual also provided more detailed instructions for how consular officers should consider an applicant’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education and skills when making a public charge determination. Immigration lawyers and advocates contend that changes increased the burden on the applicant.

In addition, the department added new language to the manual tightening standards for applicants to the diversity visa lottery program. The program — a frequent Trump target — offers 50,000 visas annually to immigrants from countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S.

The new provision said consular officers “should review the totality of the [diversity visa] applicant’s circumstances … to determine his ability to become or remain self-sufficient in the United States.”

The statistics obtained by POLITICO include per-country breakdowns of denials that previously were not available to the public. The dataset varies slightly from public charge denials posted in the State Department’s annual visa report. The discrepancy is due to a new department methodology that subtracts any immigrants who overcame a public charge determination in that fiscal year from the annual total.

The city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit in November 2018 that argued the State Department’s foreign affairs manual changes had discouraged immigrants from accessing public benefits to which they were entitled. The city claimed the change discriminated “on the basis of race, national origin, nationality, income, or receipt of public benefits, and was motivated by animus and a desire to effect such discrimination.”

Several immigration lawyers told POLITICO that they had dealt with Mexican clients — some of them long-term U.S. residents but undocumented immigrants — stranded in Mexico because they were denied immigrant visas on public charge grounds.

While Mexico saw the steepest rise in public charge rejections, the number of public charge denials also shot up for visa applications from several other countries.

The State Department denied 1,254 Indian immigrant visa applications in fiscal 2018, a sharp increase over the 268 denials the year before. No Indian applicants were denied on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016, according to the data obtained by POLITICO.

The trend appeared to cool in the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, with only 129 public charge refusals to Indian applicants.

Applicants from Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced a similar increase in denials.

The State Department refused 1,502 Bangladeshi immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018. Consular statistics show no Bangladeshi denials in fiscal 2016. The department turned away 1,246 Pakistani immigrant visa applicants that year, an increase over just two denials in fiscal 2016.

Applicants from Haiti and the Dominic Republic, countries that sit side-by-side on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, also saw public charge rejections shoot up.

The State Department turned away 1,109 Haitian immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018, after no denials two years earlier.

Applicants from the Dominic Republic saw 1,012 immigrant visa denials through the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, up from a single rejection in fiscal 2016.

Some countries experienced little change. Only three Canadian immigrant visa applicants were refused on public charge grounds in fiscal 2018. A single applicant from that country was denied in fiscal 2016."
China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Trump administration freezes foreign aid funds pending review,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Nicole Gaouette']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/omb-state-department-usaid-letter/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration has put a temporary hold on the majority of congressionally approved foreign aid funds, pending a review by the State Department and the US Agency for International Development. Critics say the move undercuts Congress and fear that it is another attempt by the administration to cancel aid programs that advocates see as vital to US interests.

The Office of Management and Budget informed the two agencies in a letter Saturday that unobligated funds would be frozen until ""three business days after"" State and USAID provide an accounting of how much remains in specific accounts and how the funds are being spent. Those funds expire on September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was out of the country when the letter, addressed to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, was sent. Congress was on recess.

A USAID official told CNN the funding amounts to between $2 billion and $4 billion.

The accounts specified in the letter include funding for international organizations, international peacekeeping, international narcotics control and law enforcement, global health, development assistance, foreign military and assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia.

The Washington Post was the first to report on the letter.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""if an agency can't even tell us how much money is in the account, I have no confidence in their ability to tell me where the money is going to go to.""

Based on the responses from the agencies, OMB may propose to Congress canceling the appropriated funds, which is known as rescission, or reprogramming them.

The USAID official told CNN that ""it is pretty clear they will try to rescind the money."" That official noted that OMB made a similar attempt last year but Congress rejected the move.

The review will take several days, the official said, and it is expected that the tally will be sent to OMB by early next week at the latest. However, the official noted that if OMB decides to maintain the freeze in an effort to cancel any of the foreign aid, it could take a while to get the funding streams open because it would require action from Congress.

""It'll be a long process,"" said the official.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""the accounts that are being looked at include programs that many over the years have considered wasteful like ones that would pay for solar panels in the Caribbean, a space program in Pakistan, soccer camps in Guatemala, and foreign aid to countries that aren't in the best interest of US foreign policy.""

Liz Schrayer, the president of the US Global Leadership Council, condemned OMB's action as ""reckless and irresponsible.""

""These are programs that are in our interest,"" she told CNN. ""If we take ourselves off the playing field, we do it at our own peril. These are programs that we are using to advance our economic and our security interests and I think it is really surprising that the administration is pulling back on what is less than 1% of our entire budget when there are such great threats in the world.""

In a statement, Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called the move a ""dangerous action"" and vowed to reverse any rescission or reprogramming.

""This Administration's contempt for Congress is astounding. When Congress decides how much we spend on foreign assistance, it isn't a suggestion. It's the law, backed up by the constitution,"" the New York Demcrat wrote in a statement. ""President Trump and Secretary Pompeo should follow the law and stop playing politics with our foreign affairs budget. If they move ahead with this plan, I'll use the full power of the Foreign Affairs Committee to reverse their efforts and to demand answers about why this Administration seems determined to ignore the will Congress and undermine American leadership.""

The State Department and USAID referred CNN to OMB for comment.

""It is incumbent on all Federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress. In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely,"" OMB spokesperson Rachel Semmel said in a statement."
Justice Department files amicus brief in Mazars case shielding Trump from House subpoena.,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/justice-department-mazars-subpoena-trump-barr.html,"Attorney General William Barr speaks at the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University School of Law on July 23 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice filed a disgraceful amicus brief urging a federal appeals court to block the House of Representatives’ subpoena of the president’s financial records. There is no clear purpose for the brief other than a blatantly partisan effort to shield Trump from congressional oversight. It is a startling departure from the DOJ’s traditional independence and another sign that Attorney General William Barr views his job as running interference for the president.

Donald Trump’s lawyers—his personal attorneys, not the DOJ—have been fighting this subpoena since the House Oversight Committee issued it in April. The committee sought eight years of financial records from Mazars USA, which provided accounting services to Trump. Congress has broad constitutional authority to investigate the president, and the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must honor any subpoena with a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Trump’s lawyers argue that the committee’s subpoena lacks such a purpose, and was merely intended to “harass” the president. In its amicus brief, the Justice Department parrots this argument, framing the House’s subpoena as an effort to torment Trump by inspecting his finances for political gain.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected that argument in May. Mehta noted that the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, had provided a memorandum detailing a number of legitimate reasons for the subpoena. Cummings wrote that the committee sought to learn whether Trump “accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics” so it could determine “whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws.” The committee also wished to discover whether Trump “has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions.”

The House has already passed an ethics bill, H.R. 1, this year with provisions aimed directly at the executive. Lawmakers plainly have a “legitimate legislative purpose,” Mehta wrote, in probing the president’s ethics to decide whether these reforms are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, the committee wished to know “whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office.” It “is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Finally, the committee sought to learn whether Trump had complied with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting any gift from a foreign government without Congress’ consent. “Surely,” Mehta wrote, “incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the President’s receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President’s compliance with the Clause.”

Trump’s lawyers promptly appealed Mehta’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of judges for the D.C. Circuit is currently mulling whether Mehta got it right.

The Justice Department had no reason to step in; Trump is amply represented by his own attorneys, and this matter does not require the defense of some federal law. To the contrary, the DOJ typically sits out such interbranch disputes, and it has no obvious interest in siding with the president against Congress here.

But the DOJ filed an amicus brief anyway—weeks after oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit—and it is flabbergasting. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts may not search for some covert illicit motive among committee members; if the committee states a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the judiciary must respect it. The DOJ ignores this rule. It argues that the House’s actions raise “the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch.” And it calls for a “searching evaluation” of committee members’ motives.

The DOJ argues that Cummings’ memorandum justifying the subpoena is “insufficient” because it was “not ratified by the full House.” It cites no authority for this proposition because it is made-up; the Supreme Court has never held that a committee’s subpoena is invalid until ratified by the full chamber. But even if that were the law, the DOJ has a problem: The full House already ratified the Mazars subpoena. In response to this fact, the DOJ claims that the House’s vote doesn’t count because “it did so only as part of a general authorization for pending and future investigations.” There is no precedent to support the argument that the House must ratify a subpoena with some unknown level of specificity; it is a blatant exercise in moving the goalposts. The DOJ is attempting to throw new roadblocks in front of the committee on the basis of its own pseudo-constitutional beliefs.

But that’s not even the strangest part of the brief. The DOJ insists that the House cannot investigate Trump pursuant to its impeachment authority. Why? Because it hasn’t asserted “jurisdiction over” impeachment. In other words, the House’s constitutional power of impeachment lies dormant until someone declares an intent to impeach. Who, exactly, holds this mystical authority? A committee chair? The speaker? A majority of lawmakers, shouting in unison? Who knows? The DOJ does not say when the impeachment power officially kicks in, because it has concocted this rule out of thin air. Maybe Mehta was on to something when he wrote that it “is simply not fathomable” that the Constitution could (silently) limit the impeachment power so arbitrarily.

Ironically, the DOJ ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to.

The DOJ brief fares no better in its dismissal of Congress’ authority over emoluments. Again, the Constitution explicitly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign states without Congress’ consent. But the DOJ argues that this power does not justify the subpoena because there’s no proof the House “is investigating the President with a view toward consenting to any undisclosed emoluments.”

That is a lie. Cummings’ memorandum expressly stated that the House sought “to assess whether [Trump] is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.” If that weren’t enough—and it is—Cummings is also investigating Trump International Hotel to determine whether it grants Trump unconstitutional emoluments. Recognizing, perhaps, that the courts cannot rigorously scrutinize a committee’s stated intentions, the DOJ has chosen to pretend the committee never stated those intentions in the first place.

Most gallingly, the DOJ urges the court to reject the legitimacy of the House’s legislative purpose by preemptively declaring its legislation unconstitutional. The DOJ writes that H.R. 1 and similar proposals do not deserve any “presumption of legitimacy” because they are probably illegal. It claims that the Constitution bars Congress from forcing the president to divest from his conflicts of interest. Thus, the House cannot investigate Trump to help it craft ethics reforms, since those reforms are unconstitutional.

This argument is astonishing. Federal courts are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions on the constitutionality of pending legislation. A bill cannot be challenged in federal court if it is just a bill; this is Schoolhouse Rock stuff. Yet the DOJ is essentially asking the judiciary to declare a provision of H.R. 1 unconstitutional before it becomes law. This vast expansion of judicial power would constitute an advisory opinion on steroids. The courts would be obligated to gauge the legality of bills under consideration in Congress every time they are asked to quash a congressional subpoena. That is not and cannot be the law.

Ironically, the DOJ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to. The Supreme Court curtails the judiciary’s ability to quash congressional subpoenas for a reason. Once courts start inspecting lawmakers’ motives, they become entangled in the legislative process. It is not the job of judges to decide whether the House really needed to issue a subpoena; once a committee stated a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the courts must butt out. Otherwise, judges will wind up curbing Congress’ constitutional powers and effectively killing legislation before it passes. The judiciary is ill-equipped to determine just how much information lawmakers require to govern effectively.

Still, counterproductive as the DOJ’s brief may be, it reveals the full extent of the department’s distortion under Barr. The Justice Department represents the United States, not the president himself, and it has no business putting its thumb on the scale of Trump in his fight against Congress. Barr may see the office of the attorney general as an outpost of the White House. He may see himself as a loyal foot soldier for Trump in his squabble with Democrats. But the Justice Department was never intended to be a weapon for presidents to wield against their political opponents. Tuesday’s brief degrades the institution, eroding its legitimacy for purely partisan goals."
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Selim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"
"Peter Strzok, key figure in Russia probe, sues FBI, DOJ over firing",https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/456399-strzok-key-figure-in-russia-probe-sues-fbi-doj-over-firing,"Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who came under fire for sending disparaging text messages about President Trump Donald John TrumpMSNBC's Geist presses Castro on sharing Trump donors names: These people 'are already being harassed' Marianne Williamson: Message of love 'absolutely' extends to Trump Hickenlooper says Democrats are falling for 'Trump's execrable politics of distraction' MORE and other political figures during the 2016 presidential race, is suing his former employer over his firing, claiming the decision was a result of ""unrelenting pressure"" from Trump.

In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday against the FBI and Justice Department, Strzok's counsel argued that his firing was politically motivated and in violation of two constitutional amendments.

In particular, they argued that he was fired for using his protected political speech under the First Amendment and that the FBI also “deprived” him of his due process under the Fifth Amendment by denying him the right to appeal the decision.

The lawsuit also alleges that unlawful leaks to the press violated the Privacy Act.

""The concerted public campaign to disparage and, ultimately, fire Special Agent Strzok was enabled by the defendants’ deliberate and unlawful disclosure to the media of texts, intended to be private, from an FBI systems of records, in violation of the Privacy Act,” according to the court documents.

Strzok, who was fired in August 2018, argued that his firing was politically motivated because a top FBI executive originally recommended a different, less extreme disciplinary response to his conduct.

FBI Assistant Director Candice Will, who led the Office of Professional Responsibility, initially recommended against firing the agent, instead proposing that he “be demoted and suspended for sixty days without pay,” the court documents read.

“Will’s decision was based upon the facts underlying the charges in the proposed removal, the agency’s schedule of disciplinary offenses, the agency’s record of discipline in comparable circumstances, and upon Strzok’s long and outstanding record of service to the FBI and the country,” the court documents argue, noting that it also reflected a “last chance agreement” that Strzok had accepted.

Nevertheless, Strzok was still fired, and because his firing was “effective immediately,” he was prevented him from appealing the decision to the FBI’s Disciplinary Review Board or any other formal avenue to receive due process.

“The discharge decision was made by Deputy Director David Bowdich, and was the result of unrelenting pressure from President Trump and his political allies in Congress and the media,” the court filing states.

Strzok’s firing came also after Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a lengthy 500-page report last year that fiercely criticized Strzok for his conduct, saying he displayed a “biased state of mind” during a key phase of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOnetime GOP stronghold in California now has more Democrats than Republicans Conservatives buck Trump over worries of 'socialist' drug pricing Mississippi Republicans head to gubernatorial runoff MORE's email practices.

Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the bureau, sent messages critical of the then-Republican candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential race to then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page. The two were having an extramarital affair at the time.

One of the most explosive revelations from Horowitz's report was a text Strzok sent to Page in which he said they will ""stop"" Trump from becoming president.

Strzok described that text during public testimony before Congress last year as “written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then-candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero.""

Horowitz ultimately said his investigative team found no evidence that any decision made during the course of the investigation was a result of political bias or improper influence. Nonetheless, the report found that those actions cast a cloud over the department and was deeply critical of FBI and Justice Department leadership.

Strzok served both as the No. 2 official on the FBI Clinton probe as well as briefly on special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE’s investigative team. But Mueller promptly removed Strzok from his team after Horowitz's internal review uncovered the critical Trump text messages.

Revelations of the text messages sparked a barrage of attacks from Trump and Republicans, who have alleged that the top brass at the FBI and Justice Department harbored an anti-Trump bias during the 2016 election.

The Department of Justice declined to comment on Strzok's lawsuit.

USDA has justified its decision to relocate the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture offices to the Kansas City area for both financial reasons and to put the researchers closer to the agricultural heartland.

But it is seen by critics as a swipe at the agency's scientific expertise and was largely unwelcome with agency employees . Those offices unionized, and around 70% told union organizers they would not make the move.

Larry Summers warns we could be at the 'most dangerous financial moment' since 2009,https://www.cnbc.com,['Silvia Amaro'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/larry-summer-tweets-on-china-us-trade-currency-war.html,"The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is potentially creating ""the most dangerous financial moment"" since the global crash at the end of the last decade, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said.

Markets have been on sell-off mode since last week, with Wall Street seeing its worst trading day this year on Monday. There are deep concerns about the heightened tension in the relationship between the U.S. and China, after President Donald Trump said he would slap new tariffs on Chinese goods and the Treasury Department declared Monday that Beijing is manipulating its currency. The Dow ended more than 700 points lower and investors flocked to safe havens on Monday, including gold and bonds. The precious metal is hovering around a six-year peak and bond prices continue to fall.

""We may well be at the most dangerous financial moment since the 2009 Financial Crisis with current developments between the U.S. and China,"" Summers, who was Treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and an economic advisor to former President Barack Obama, said on Twitter late Monday.

The global financial crisis, which began in 2008, became the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.

Summers added: ""Markets are now suggesting the highest risk of recession since 2011. …The collapse in medium- and long-term interest rates is ominous.""

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Monday they do not expect the world's two largest economies to reach an agreement over trade before the 2020 election. As a result, the investment bank is projecting two more rate cuts this year, in September and October.

""The Fed has been increasingly responsive this year to trade war threats, bond market expectations, and global growth concerns,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.

""In light of growing trade policy risks, market expectations for much deeper rate cuts, and an increase in global risk related to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, we now expect a third 25 basis points rate cut in October, for a total of 75 basis points of cuts (this year),"" the bank added.

The Fed cut rates at its last meeting, but Chairman Jerome Powell noted that it was just a ""midcycle readjustment"" and lowered expectations regarding further cuts. However, since then, the trade war has intensified."
Environmental group sues EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456560-epa-sued-over-decision-to-allow-use-of-pesticide-tied-to-brain,"A prominent advocacy group sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday over the agency's decision to allow further use of a pesticide linked to brain damage.

Earthjustice filed its lawsuit in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of groups advocating for environmentalists, farmworkers and people with learning disabilities. The organization argued in court documents that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide, should be banned due to the dangers associated with it.

“A chlorpyrifos ban is long overdue given the overwhelming evidence that says this pesticide harms brain development in children,” Tracy Gregoire, a project coordinator at the Learning Disabilities Association of America, said in a statement. “We are hopeful the courts will side with children who are now being exposed to irreparable, yet preventable harm.”

Chlorpyrifos, known on the market as Lorsban, is used on a wide variety of crops, including corn and cranberries. Farmers have called it the last line of defense against certain insects.

But it has also been linked to learning and memory issues and prolonged nerve and muscle stimulation.

The EPA banned chlorpyrifos for household use in 2001 over concerns it would cause brain damage in children.

EPA’s decision to allow continued use of chlorpyrifos came last month, the result of a court-ordered deadline to regulate the pesticide prompted by a lawsuit previously filed by Earthjustice.

EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said those challenging the use of chlorpyrifos did not have enough data to demonstrate the product is not safe. The EPA said it would continue to review the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022.

""Registration review is a comprehensive, scientific and transparent process that will further evaluate the potential effects of chlorpyrifos. EPA has also been engaged in discussions with the chlorpyrifos registrants that could result in further use limitations,"" the agency said in a statement to The Hill.

In the absence of EPA action, some states have moved to regulate chlorpyrifos on their own. Hawaii last year banned its use, and California and New York are considering a similar move.

California, the nation’s top agricultural state, said it was obligated to take action due to research showing chlorpyrifos hinders brain development in children.

Farmers and other groups have urged the EPA to keep chlorpyrifos available.

“Without the ability to use chlorpyrifos, entire production fields could be lost,” the American Seed Trade Association wrote in a letter to the agency in 2017.

But many farmworkers say they have been injured by prolonged exposure to the pesticide.

“A nerve agent pesticide that poisons workers and damages children’s developing brain has no place near our fruits and vegetables,” Ramon Ramirez, president of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, a Latino farmworker group based in Oregon, said in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to seeing the courts do what EPA refuses to do, protect workers and children with a chlorpyrifos ban.”

The Trump administration released a proposed rule in October that would bar immigrants from obtaining a green card or seeking a visa renewal if they had received government benefits, or if they would likely need them in the future.

That regulation is expected to be finalized in the coming days.

Over the past year, more and more immigrants, particularly from Mexico, who hope to move the US are being denied due to public charge determinations.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The State Department denied 5,343 immigrant visa applications for Mexican nationals between Oct. 1 and July 29 because they were poor and, therefore, could be ""public charges"" dependent on the US government for support, according to data obtained by POLITICO.

That number compares to just seven applicants from Mexico who were denied in fiscal year 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in the White House.

The whopping increase in public charge denials comes after the State Department last year gave US consular officers more discretion to reject visas if they believed that person could become a public charge and require public welfare benefits. In October, the Trump administration officially released a proposed public charge rule that would bar immigrants from obtaining a green card or seeking a visa renewal if they had received government benefits, like Medicaid, food stamps, or Section 8 housing vouchers, or if they would likely need them in the future.

As noted by POLITICO, that regulation is expected to be finalized in the coming days.

Over the past year, more and more immigrants, particularly from Mexico, who hope to come to the US are being denied due to these public charge determinations.

That was the case for 33-year-old Arturo Balbino, a Mexican national who had illegally entered the US 14 years ago and worked as a construction worker in Texas. Balbino applied for a spousal visa at the American consulate in Ciudad Juarez in March, believing his chances were strong because he had a wife and children who are US citizens, as well as a father-in-law who pledged to financially support him if necessary, he told Reuters in April.

Instead, his application was denied by the consular officer on the grounds that he could become a drain on US taxpayers by requiring government financial assistance, per documents reviewed by Reuters.

""At times I want to think that everything will be okay and I'll be able to be with my family again,"" Balbino said. ""It's very difficult to think that I won't be able to return to watch my children grow up.""

Several immigration lawyers told POLITICO that many of their Mexican clients, some of whom had lived in the US for years but are undocumented, have found themselves stranded in Mexico after being denied immigrant visas as a result of public charge.

In total, 12,179 visa applications from people across the world have been rejected due to public charge in the past year, per the preliminary data obtained by POLITICO, compared to 1,033 people in fiscal year 2016.

POLITICO noted that applicants from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic also saw major increases in denials due to concerns they would be a public charge and rely on government benefits.

As noted in a policy brief by the Migration Policy Institute, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that around 382,000 people within the US seeking a green card each year could be affected by public charge rules. The Institute found that another 559,000 people living abroad could be impacted when applying for visas abroad.

""It is imposing a tougher standard for working-class people,"" Charles Wheeler, a director with the pro-migrant Catholic Legal Immigration Network, told POLITICO."
"FBI employees disciplined for unauthorized disclosures received lighter punishments after internal review, docs show",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/14-fbi-employees-referred-for-discipline-over-unauthorized-disclosures-docs-show,"At least 14 FBI employees were referred to the agency's internal ethics office for unauthorized disclosures of classified or sensitive information in the last three years, according to FBI Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) documents obtained by the conservative transparency group Judicial Watch.

The documents, released Tuesday, offered a window into what the Department of Justice Inspector General (IG) has characterized as a culture of leaking at the FBI, which allegedly permeated the bureau's highest levels, and how the agency polices itself. In several instances, the documents show that OPR's proposed punishments for FBI employees were reduced dramatically.

IG and DOJ reviews of the FBI's handling of the counterintelligence probe into President Trump's team, and related matters, are ongoing.

""We have profound concerns about the volume and extent of unauthorized media contacts by FBI personnel that we have uncovered during our review,” the IG wrote in a bombshell report last year, noting that some of the FBI's improper press communications came from phones at the agency's Washington, D.C. headquarters.

The IG added: “FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

COMEY MEMOS CONTAINED 'CODE NAME AND TRUE IDENTITY' OF CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE

Punishments for the alleged violations outlined in the new OPR files ranged from letters of censure and week-long suspensions without pay, to several summary dismissals.

According to the documents, in June 2017, OPR found that a senior FBI employee “misused an FBI database, and provided sensitive information to a former FBI employee."" That employee thought he “had the support of his Division to use his discretion,"" and ultimately received a letter of censure from the bureau's top brass, instead of OPR's recommended 15-day suspension.

In October 2017, an unidentified FBI employee was recommended for termination by OPR, but received a 45-day unpaid suspension instead.

In January 2019, another employee received a 60-day unpaid suspension, instead of the termination recommended by OPR.

One employee was accused of “Investigative deficiency – improper handling of documents or property in the care, custody or control of the government; unauthorized disclosure – classified/law enforcement sensitive/grand jury information” and “failure to report – administrative.” He received only a 10-calendar day suspension wtihout pay in February 2018, instead of a proposed 30-calendar day suspension.

One file closed on March 20, 2018 which apparently refers to former FBI Director Andrew McCabe, states in mitigation the employee had a ""remarkable performance record"" and was ""facing unprecedented challenges and pressures"" when he ""released the FBI Sensitive information to a reporter and lacked candor not under oath and under oath when questioned about it.""

CLINTON-APPOINTED JUDGE DISMISSES DNC LAWSUIT ON TRUMP-RUSSIA CONSPIRACY AS 'ENTIRELY DIVORCED' FROM FACTS

Nevertheless, a factor in ""aggravation"" was that the employee ""held an extremely high position and was expected to comport himself with the utmost integrity"" and that ""lack of candor is incompatible with the FBI’s Core Values.""

""OPR PROPOSED DECISION: Proposed DISMISSAL,"" the document stated, noting that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions would need to issue final approval.

""OPR FINAL DECISION: DISMISSAL,"" the file concluded.

McCabe's violations stemmed from his response to an October 2016 Wall Street Journal report about sizeable campaign donations from Democrats to McCabe's wife, Jill, during her campaign for the Virginia State Senate. An IG investigation found that McCabe instructed FBI lawyer Lisa Page and FBI public affairs chief Michael Kortan to work with the Journal's reporter to set the record straight.

McCabe later sued the DOJ to obtain documents related to this termination, while another former high-ranking anti-Trump FBI official, Peter Strzok, announced Tuesday he was outright suing the bureau over his termination.

An investigative source told Fox News that Page’s statements to investigators were “critical” because they directly contradicted her boss, McCabe. According to the source, McCabe's lack of candor about the contact with the Journal reporter led to his firing. The source added that Page's testimony about the matter contradicted McCabe's. Then-FBI Director James Comey claimed he never authorized the leak to the Journal.

Comey himself has faced scrutiny in recent days. Last week, bureau documents also obtained by Judicial Watch revealed that FBI agents went to Comey's house and retrieved as ""evidence"" a secret, previously unreported memo he wrote, well after he was fired as FBI Director.

STRZOK FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST FBI, SAYING TERMINATION WAS POLITICAL

Additionally, Comey told agents ""spontaneously"" that, to ""the best of his recollection, two [memos] were missing,"" according to the documents.

The day after agents visited his home, Comey admitted in congressional testimony that he had leaked memos purportedly documenting his contemporaneous recollections of his conversations with President Trump, through a friend, so that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be appointed. Comey wrote, for instance, that Trump allegedly demanded his loyalty, and said he hoped the FBI would let the Michael Flynn matter ""go.""

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

However, the DOJ decided last week against prosecuting Comey for classified information following a criminal referral from the IG, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

In April, a court-ordered filing by the DOJ revealed Comey included a slew of sensitive and classified information in a series of comprehensive personal memos -- including not only the details of his conversations with Trump, but also the ""code name and true identity"" of a confidential source.

The filing acknowledged that Comey maintained a far more detailed and lengthy private paper trail than was previously known, and that federal investigators apparently hoped to use Comey's contemporaneous, secretive writings to test the truthfulness of Trump's comments as part of a then-ongoing obstruction-of-justice inquiry.

Comey meticulously outlined ""foreign intelligence information obtained from and through"" the key human source, ""information about whether the FBI initiated coverage through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) on a particular individual,"" relevant ""sources and methods"" used in the FBI's investigation and ""information concerning the President's foreign policy decisionmaking,"" according to the DOJ.

All of that information was ""currently and properly classified,"" the DOJ noted.

"USDA science agencies’ relocation may have violated law, inspector general report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'August At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/05/usda-science-agencies-relocation-may-have-violated-law-inspector-general-report-says/,"

A federal watchdog challenged the Trump administration’s authority to move two USDA science agencies out of Washington, in a report issued a few days after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, praised the move for encouraging federal scientists to quit their jobs.

The plan to relocate the two agencies from the District to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs.

“This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

In his keynote speech at the Republican Party’s black-tie-optional Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina on Friday, Mulvaney seemed to celebrate the attrition at the agencies. “You’ve heard about ‘drain the swamp.’ What you probably haven’t heard is what we are actually doing. I don’t know if you saw the news the other day, but the USDA just tried to move, or did move, two offices out of Washington, D.C.,"" he said.

As the crowd clapped, Mulvaney continued: “Yes, you can applaud that one. That’s what we’ve been talking about doing. Guess what happened? Guess what happened? More than half the people quit.

“It’s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,” Mulvaney said. “I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I’ve tried . . . By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government, and do what we haven’t been able to do for a long time.”

Trump officials are planning additional shake-ups and exoduses from Washington. By 2020, more than 80 percent of the headquarters staff at the Bureau of Land Management will be moved west of the Rocky Mountains, the Interior Department told lawmakers in July. The Trump administration also wants to break up the Office of Personnel Management and split 5,500 workers among three other departments.

J. David Cox Sr., president of American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the two USDA agencies, said Mulvaney’s comments confirmed the union’s concerns. “The administration’s decision to transfer hundreds of USDA jobs from D.C. isn’t about helping federal employees do their jobs better or delivering better services to the American taxpayer,” Cox said in a statement. “Their goal is to drive out hard-working and dedicated civil servants and silence the parts of the agencies’ research that the administration views as inconvenient.” A study from ERS, for instance, one of the agencies targeted for the move, showed that a $1.5 trillion tax bill signed by Trump offered few, if any, benefits to low-income farmers.

Congress questioned whether USDA has the legal authority to move the agencies. The department has this power, according to the inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the watchdog group said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) called the inspector general report “very troubling” said it confirms “suspicions that the secretary does not have the authority to proceed with this relocation.”

G. William Hoagland, a vice president at the D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, predicted that the failure to get congressional approval “will certainly set in motion legal challenges” from the union to halt the move “until either the courts or Congress act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek approval from a congressional committee.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

This report has been updated.

Homeland Security chief calls for more resources to fight domestic terrorism after report highlights shift in funding,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/el-paso-shooting-homeland-security-kevin-mcaleenan-resources-domestic-terrorism-report-highlights-funding/,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan responded to a report Tuesday that an initiative focused on targeted violence and terrorism prevention has about a quarter of the staff and an eighth of the budget of a similar program in the Obama administration. ""We need to invest more — no question,"" McAleenan said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning.""

""I've asked Congress for an out-of-cycle budget request to help bolster it and increase our reach and capability. But it doesn't cover the level and scope of effort across the Department of Homeland Security enterprise,"" McAleenan said, adding the Secret Service reaches out to communities about what threat indicators to look out for and the department provides active shooter training to cities around the country.

There have been more than 250 mass shootings so far this year in the U.S., more than the number of days in the year thus far. At least 31 people were killed and scores were hurt in two mass shootings last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

The DHS chief said ideally he'd like to triple the staff available to better address the rise in attacks and ""coordinate the intelligence side of it at the headquarters level as well as investing in those grants and efforts that are going to help communities prepare for these kind of incidents.""

McAleenan said his agency is acting aggressively to address mass shootings after President Trump gave his agency clear marching orders to locate the root cause of these events.

""I've also directed a surge of all of our training and preparedness assets on a risk basis to communities across the country based on what we know,"" McAleenan said. He said DHS had also established an advisory council and created task forces to develop a better understanding of these attacks across the country.

In El Paso, some members of the Hispanic community suggested Mr. Trump's rhetoric has contributed toward acts of hatred. Asked about the president's rhetoric, McAleenan said, ""I think we've got a responsibility to call out hate in all of its forms, and white supremacist extremism is a critical element that we're trying to address. I think the president was very clear on that yesterday.""

In a nationally televised address Monday on the shootings, the president said the gunman was consumed by racist hate, and Mr. Trump condemned white supremacy. He also blamed mental illness and hate for the attacks, not guns.

McAleenan's comments come just after the FBI issued a new warning about domestic terror threats, saying ""violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.""

The DHS chief agreed with that assessment, saying over the last two years, a ""number of their investigations are racially motivated and within that category the majority are white-supremacist-extremist motivated.""

Meanwhile, the Justice Department said it was treating the El Paso shooting as domestic terrorism after the 21-year old suspect, who is accused of killing at least 22 people, allegedly wrote a racist essay in which he denounced the increasing Hispanic population in Texas.

McAleenan said that the Texas shooting hit home for him because members of the Customs and Border Patrol agency, which is a part of DHS, were in the Walmart where the shooting happened.

""We actually had one of our leaders, a port director ... in the Walmart during the attack. She responded and provided lifesaving assistance to one of the injured victims and just tremendously proud of her and her response,"" McAleenan said."
New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals',https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456361-new-mexico-says-epa-abandoned-state-in-fight-against-toxic-forever,"New Mexico’s Democratic governor is pushing back against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to help the state fight contamination from “forever chemicals” spread by a military base.

In a Friday letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerNew Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' Overnight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process MORE, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham Michelle Lynn Lujan GrishamNew Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' Walmart to stop selling guns in New Mexico New Mexico governor to Nike after Arizona snub: 'Let's talk' MORE said the lack of help from the EPA “is inconsistent with its mission to protect public health and the environment” and is an example of “EPA’s failure to uphold compliance with federal environmental laws.”

The EPA responded Tuesday that it cannot let ""short-term litigation posturing"" interfere with its mission to protect human and environmental health.

Lujan Grisham’s letter is in reference to a class of chemicals abbreviated as PFAS, cancer-linked substances used in a variety of nonstick products and firefighting foam relied on by the military and airports.

PFAS are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment.

The letter, first reported by Politico, is the latest example of frustrations from states in getting the military to work with local leaders in cleaning up contamination.

Some of the blame has been levied against the EPA after suspicions the agency weakened its own PFAS regulations to help the military avoid what could be a $2 billion cleanup bill.

Lawmakers, however, have worked to strengthen the military’s PFAS culpability, including measures in the National Defense Authorization Act to force the military to work with states to clean up contamination.

A measure from Sen. Tom Udall Thomas (Tom) Stewart UdallNew Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' Democrats introduce constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United House passes bill requiring CBP to enact safety, hygiene standards MORE (D-N.M.) included in the House bill would require the military to provide clean water to farms contaminated by PFAS.

Udall was motivated by the plight of a New Mexico dairy farmer who euthanized 4,000 of his cows after the milk they produced tested positive for high levels of PFAS. That farm, located near a military base, caught the attention of Food and Drug Administration researchers in documenting the spread of PFAS from water to food.

New Mexico sued the Air Force for PFAS contamination in March, and Lujan Grisham’s letter criticizes EPA for reneging on a promise from Wheeler to help the state “with legal and technical assistance in a confidential manner.”

“Providing fact sheets and offering webinars are not meaningful,” she wrote.

In responding to request for comment from The Hill, the EPA pointed to a July letter from the agency’s top lawyer and assistant administrator that said EPA is not permitted to bring judicial action against another executive branch agency.

It goes on to list actions EPA has taken to assist New Mexico, including providing fact sheets and webinars along with attending meetings and calls.

But a separate Friday letter from New Mexico Environment Department head James Kenney to another EPA office disputes that reasoning, arguing that “EPA is unrestricted from taking administrative enforcement actions against federal agencies under its controlling acts.”

The EPA responded to that letter Tuesday, saying its work with New Mexico should not be disparaged.

""If the state has not found our assistance useful, that has not been communicated as we have worked jointly on this issue,"" the agency wrote to the governor, adding that the state's letter ""has the potential to miscommunicate to the public the truth of the federal-state collaboration.""

New Mexico pushed back against the Tuesday letter after it was first reported by The Hill.

""EPA suggests the concerns public officials have for the health and safety of New Mexicans and their environment amount to ‘litigation posturing,’"" Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. ""EPA’s disconnect between what has been offered and what New Mexico needs demonstrates a lack of understanding of what our rural New Mexico communities are facing. The Attorney General and the Environment Department will continue to push on behalf of our communities until PFAS is no longer a threat.""

The Department of Defense did not respond to request for comment.

New Mexico is not alone in its frustration with the EPA or the military. Last month 22 attorneys general wrote a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to compel action from the two agencies.

The State Department puts China first on rare earth metals,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-state-department-puts-china-first-on-rare-earth-metals,"HARGEISA, Somaliland — To most Americans, anarchy, intervention, and the Black Hawk Down fiasco define Somalia. By any reasonable metric, the country has not improved much since. Somalia has had the dubious honor to be crowned the world’s most corrupt country by Transparency International for 14 years running. Terrorism is a weekly occurrence , and perhaps even a tool for some Somali politicians.

Somalia largely deserves its reputation. A generation of Somali politicians and clan leaders have siphoned off the billions of dollars which the U.S. government and other outside powers have invested in the country. The national Somali military, built to supplant the country’s patchwork of militias, exists largely on paper. In recent weeks, Somali elders, soldiers, and politicians have lined up to apologize to and swear allegiance to al Shabaab, an extremist group responsible for terrorism both inside and outside Somalia.

Somaliland, the northern third of the country and a former British protectorate, however, is a happy exception. It gained its independence (and U.S. recognition) in 1960, only to forfeit it days later when it entered into a union with the rest of Somalia. It was an unhappy marriage marked by dictatorship in Mogadishu and later genocide against the Somaliland population. Finally, in 1991, Somaliland left the union and reasserted its independence. Today, it is peaceful, stable, and even without international recognition, one of the most democratic countries in Africa. It is the first country in the world, for example, to use biometric iris scans for voter registration.

Alas, the State Department ignores Somaliland and instead operates under the fiction that Somalia works. Like a gambler who believes he can redeem his losses with just one more hand at the blackjack table, it continues to pour money into the country, never mind the historical reverse correlation in Somalia between aid and stability. This fiction and gambler’s addiction increasingly undermine vital U.S. national interests.

Historically, Somaliland’s greatest resource was livestock and, for better or worse, charcoal. Energy companies now explore for gas and oil both in Somaliland and Somalia.

The real strategic asset of Somaliland, however, might be rare earth metals.

Mining is a new industry, but already Somaliland is becoming a resource for the rare elements necessary for modern electronics and cutting-edge technology. China has tried to monopolize rare earth elements both to bolster its own economy and, for strategic reasons, to deny them to the United States.

Here is where the State Department strategy is so narrow minded. Somaliland officials say that Chinese companies are aggressive in seeking mining concessions in Somaliland. Somaliland, which has traditionally been both moderate in its outlook and pro-Western, prefers to work with the United States and Europe. But, in order to maintain the fiction that Mogadishu is a success (even though a half billion dollars each year buys the Somali government control over just a few square blocks in the center of Mogadishu) the U.S. government dissuades American companies from signing separate contracts with authorities in Hargeisa, the Somaliland seat of government.

After all, if the U.S. government does not recognize Somaliland’s legal right to issue contracts, then any American businesses operating in Somaliland are illegally infringing on Somali sovereignty. Any American support for Somaliland, the State Department also insists, would also undermine efforts to stabilize Somalia. Perhaps that makes sense in a sterile State Department boardroom or in the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, but China has no such qualms, and may tighten its rare earth monopoly while American diplomats wring their hands. Adding insult to injury, of course, is that despite the billions of dollars it has received in American assistance over the last decade, the Somali government also awards contracts to the Chinese.

It’s one thing for U.S. diplomats to fight for principle, but to do so absent a sense of vital U.S. national interests or a sense of Horn of Africa realities is counterproductive. Despite all the Trump administration’s rhetoric of America first, both the U.S. embassy in Somalia and the broader U.S. State Department appear effectively to be putting China first.

"AT&T workers took $1 million in bribes to unlock 2 million phones, DOJ says",https://arstechnica.com,['Jon Brodkin'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/att-employees-took-bribes-to-unlock-phones-and-plant-malware-doj-says/,"A Pakistani man bribed AT&T call-center employees to install malware and unauthorized hardware as part of a scheme to fraudulently unlock cell phones, according to the US Department of Justice. Muhammad Fahd, 34, was extradited from Hong Kong to the US on Friday and is being detained pending trial.

An indictment alleges that ""Fahd recruited and paid AT&T insiders to use their computer credentials and access to disable AT&T's proprietary locking software that prevented ineligible phones from being removed from AT&T's network,"" a DOJ announcement yesterday said. ""The scheme resulted in millions of phones being removed from AT&T service and/or payment plans, costing the company millions of dollars. Fahd allegedly paid the insiders hundreds of thousands of dollars—paying one co-conspirator $428,500 over the five-year scheme.""

In all, AT&T insiders received more than $1 million in bribes from Fahd and his co-conspirators, who fraudulently unlocked more than 2 million cell phones, the government alleged. Three former AT&T customer service reps from a call center in Bothell, Washington, already pleaded guilty and agreed to pay the money back to AT&T.

The first indictment against Fahd was filed in November 2017, and he was arrested in Hong Kong at the request of the United States in February 2018, but the case was just unsealed yesterday. Fahd is facing 14 charges in US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The charges are conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, four counts of wire fraud, two counts of accessing a protected computer in furtherance of fraud, two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, and four counts of violating the Travel Act.

AT&T generally locks phones to its network, preventing them from being used with other carriers. AT&T grants customers' unlock requests after they've paid off their contracts or device installment plans.

If a phone is unlocked before it has been paid off, resulting in a customer switching to another carrier, AT&T might not be able to collect the rest of the payments, a DOJ indictment of Fahd noted.

""Unlocked phones were a valuable commodity because they could be resold and used on any other compatible network around the world... When phones were unlocked fraudulently without AT&T's authorization and customers switched service to other carriers, the fraudulent transactions deprived AT&T of the stream of payments that were due under the service contracts and installment plans,"" the indictment said.

The alleged conspiracy involved ""the installation of malware and unauthorized hardware on AT&T's internal network,"" which Fahd and co-conspirators used to sell fraudulent phone-unlocking services to the general public, the indictment said.

Former AT&T workers pleaded guilty

Three now-former AT&T employees cooperated with the government and pleaded guilty to charges related to the conspiracy, and they are expected to testify at trial against Fahd, a court document said. Their names are Kyra Evans, DeVaughn Woods, and Marc Sapatin. All three agreed to pay financial penalties that will be transferred to AT&T, but they could also face prison time after their November 1 sentencing hearings.

Sapatin agreed to pay $441,500 in an October 2018 plea agreement. Evans agreed to pay restitution of $280,200, and Woods agreed to pay $155,032.

""We have been working closely with law enforcement since this scheme was uncovered to bring these criminals to justice and are pleased with these developments,"" AT&T told Ars.

We asked AT&T if it made any security improvements to prevent this from happening again, but we did not receive an answer. An AT&T spokesperson said that the scheme did not result in improper access to customer information.

The DOJ also charged Ghulam Jiwani, one of Fahd's alleged co-conspirators. Jiwani was arrested in Hong Kong, ""but died prior to being transferred to United States custody,"" a court document said. The charges against him were dropped as a result of his death.

Fahd and Jiwani had other co-conspirators ""known and unknown to the Grand Jury,"" the indictment said.

Evans, Woods, and Sapatin apparently were not the only AT&T employees who allegedly were involved in the scheme. The DOJ alleges that ""between 2012 and 2017, Fahd recruited various AT&T employees to the conspiracy. Some early recruits were paid to identify other employees who could be bribed and convinced to join the scheme. So far, three of those co-conspirators have pleaded guilty admitting they were paid thousands of dollars for facilitating Fahd's fraudulent scheme.""

Fahd and his co-conspirators instructed AT&T employees ""to create shell companies and open business banking accounts in the names of the shell companies"" in order to receive their bribes, the indictment said.

More details from the indictment

The scheme began in April 2012 when Fahd and his co-conspirators gave the bribed AT&T employees ""instructions... including lists of cellular telephone international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers for the insiders to submit for fraudulent and unauthorized unlocking,"" the indictment said.

The alleged malware-planting part of the conspiracy began around April 2013. Fahd, Jiwani, and others allegedly ""bribed insiders to plant malware on AT&T's internal protected computers for the purpose of gathering confidential and proprietary information on how AT&T's computer network and software applications functioned.""

Fahd and his co-conspirators used this information to create ""additional malware designed to interact with AT&T's internal protected computers and process fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests submitted... from remote servers controlled by members of the conspiracy,"" the indictment said.

With this malware, Fahd and his crew were able to ""log into AT&T's internal protected computers under false pretenses and to process fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests,"" the indictment said.

From November 2014 to September 2017, Fahd and others allegedly bribed AT&T insiders ""to install unauthorized computer hardware devices, including wireless access points designed to provide the conspiracy with unauthorized access to AT&T's internal protected computers."" With these hardware devices, Fahd and others ""facilitate[d] the automated process of submitting fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests on behalf of the conspiracy."""
Trump judges face scrutiny over president's cases,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456013-trump-judges-face-scrutiny-over-presidents-cases,"Federal judges nominated by President Trump Donald John TrumpMSNBC's Geist presses Castro on sharing Trump donors names: These people 'are already being harassed' Marianne Williamson: Message of love 'absolutely' extends to Trump Hickenlooper says Democrats are falling for 'Trump's execrable politics of distraction' MORE are facing a major public test as they handle cases that involve Trump personally or some of his most controversial policies.

New judges are already under pressure to carefully issue rulings as they learn the ropes of the federal judiciary. But three recently appointed district judges in D.C. — Trevor McFadden, Timothy Kelly and Carl Nichols — have found themselves and their rulings under a magnifying glass as they deal with cases involving Trump.

All three of the Trump-tapped judges have acted as their colleagues on the bench typically do, proceeding cautiously in the recent cases. And while legal experts disagreed over whether the judges are facing additional pressure over their rulings, they agreed that there is more attention on the cases, at least in the media.

“These judges realize that everybody's looking at them, and they're kind of behind the eight ball either way you look at it,” Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, told The Hill.

“A decision for the administration could look like favoritism, or a decision against the administration can be taken as perhaps bending over backwards not to appear supportive of them,” he added.

In the last two weeks, McFadden and Nichols have both taken careful approaches to a lawsuit over a New York law that allows Congress to obtain the president’s state tax returns.

McFadden, who was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017, was initially assigned to the lawsuit over Trump’s New York tax returns because he was also assigned to a lawsuit over the president’s federal tax returns.

But McFadden disagreed with Trump’s personal lawyers who sought to have him also oversee the new case, ordering last week that the state tax return case be randomly reassigned to a new judge.

In his order, he highlighted the importance of adhering to rules about when cases can be considered related to avoid the appearance of judge shopping and to ensure to the public that judges are assigned to cases in an impartial manner.

Nichols, who was just confirmed by the Senate in May and is so new that his name hasn’t been added to the list of D.C. district judges on the court’s website, is now taking on the New York tax returns case in what appears to be his first-ever assignment.

He has been deliberate in his handling of an emergency motion from Trump to block Democratic lawmakers from requesting the president’s New York tax returns. After initially hearing arguments in the case, he asked the parties to try to reach an agreement themselves.

When they failed to do so, Nichols held a teleconference to get more information from those involved. And one day later, he issued an order that temporarily stops New York from handing over the returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, after indicating to the parties that is how he would rule. The panel has not yet requested the returns.

Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that in the legal fights over Trump's tax returns, “it seems like both judges have been pretty cautious.”

But he said the judges’ cautious approach may have more to do with the nature of the issues before them, such as court shopping, than the fact that they are new to the bench.

Mike Stern, who served in the House Office of General Counsel from 1996 to 2004, said that the judges appear to be trying to handle lawsuits in as apolitical a manner as possible.

He said that McFadden’s actions in the tax returns case as well as one over border wall funding have been reasonable and that Nichols’s actions in the state tax return case are consistent with courts’ desire to try to not make a decision when there are disputes between different branches of government.

“If they can avoid having to make a decision, they will do that,” Stern said.

McFadden’s ruling on the tax returns case wasn’t his first high-profile case involving the president. Earlier this year, he presided over House Democrats’ lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of military funds for a border wall.

Before getting to the claims made in the lawsuit, the judge dedicated the first half of a three-hour hearing on the matter to whether he should even be allowed to oversee the proceeding. McFadden ultimately ruled that Democrats did not have standing to bring the case forward.

Kelly was first thrown into the spotlight when the White House revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaTrump judges face scrutiny over president's cases Playboy plans to appeal after reporter says his White House credentials were suspended Trump calls out Cincinnati's 'Democrat mayor' as protesters escorted out MORE's press credentials. The judge ruled against the administration in that case, ordering that the credentials be reinstated.

He also recently oversaw a lengthy hearing on a Trump policy. Kelly heard arguments for more than three hours last month on whether he should issue a temporary restraining order on a policy that would block migrants who pass through a third country from claiming asylum in the United States, with few exceptions.

Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017, was methodical in his line of questioning, pressing attorneys for both sides on the details of their arguments and frequently referring to documents laid out before him during the hearing.

As he wrapped up the proceeding, he noted the importance of both getting the case right and issuing a ruling quickly.

Kelly ultimately decided to not grant the temporary restraining order, in a win for the Trump administration. But that ruling was overshadowed just hours later, after San Francisco-based Judge Jon Tigar, an Obama appointee, issued a preliminary injunction against the asylum rule.

Some legal experts say that the Trump-appointed judges have been trying to be careful and are acting in ways that are consistent with common court practices.

But others who are following the legal cases closely are worried that Trump-appointed judges will go out of their way to act in ways that benefit the president.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who backs efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, said many Trump-appointed judges were nominated because of their conservative ideology. And he suggested they could feel pressure to show their loyalty to Republicans if they want to eventually be appointed to an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

“Their careers are tied in large measure to them continuing to be loyal,” he said.

But legal experts generally maintained that the judges are acting impartially and with the goal of reaching the best outcome possible.

“Speaking generally, we know that the party of the appointing president is a predictor of how judges will rule in cases, but it's not a very good predictor,” Wheeler said. “But most of the cases, it can be judged fairly cut and dry. The law is clear. The precedents are clear. There's really not much discretion to exercise.

“It's when you get to the cases in which the law is unclear, with new cases that lack a lot of precedents — that's when notions of public policy come into play,” he added.

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, pushed back on how much pressure the judges are under.

He argued that judges in certain circuits, such as D.C., may be more likely than those in other parts of the country to face high-profile cases during their first years. And he said that judges will rule impartially, regardless of which president appointed them to the bench.

“They’re considered judge material because they’re neutral and detached,” Blackman told The Hill."
California’s climate deal with automakers had been rejected by EPA,https://www.latimes.com,['Ryan Beene'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-06/california-climate-deal-automakers-trump-epa,"A compromise between four major automakers and California’s clean-air regulator on fuel efficiency was rejected by the Trump administration months earlier as not “a productive alternative.”

The deal — which Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW and Volkswagen announced July 25 alongside the California Air Resources Board — eases the pace of annual efficiency improvements required under current Obama-era rules but is tougher than the Trump administration’s proposal to cap mileage requirements at 2020 levels.

Key elements of the pact were contained in a November 2018 summary of California’s proposal that was prepared by Environmental Protection Agency staff for Bill Wehrum, who was assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation at the time, according to excerpts of the presentation viewed by Bloomberg.

Stanley Young, California Air Resources Board spokesman, confirmed Friday that the state had offered the plan to the EPA last November. The previously unreported detail sheds new light on the months-long battle between Washington and Sacramento over the mileage rules that automakers urged President Trump to reevaluate during his first weeks in office.

“Looking back, it seems that they were never interested in negotiations or discussions,” Young said. He added that the four automakers’ support of California’s compromise “highlights the fact that our proposal is both feasible and realistic.”

Relations between EPA and CARB officials have become tense, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown of talks. In a June 20 letter to Republican lawmakers, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said California’s counteroffer hadn’t yet been endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra when it was presented to EPA. He accused CARB Chairman Mary Nichols of being “unable or unwilling to be a good-faith negotiator.”

The Trump administration’s 2018 proposal said capping fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would lead new cars to be less expensive than they would be under the current rules. The agencies argued that more-affordable cars would enable people to replace their older vehicles with newer, safer ones more rapidly and avoid thousands of traffic fatalities — claims that experts and EPA career staffers have disputed.

Wheeler, in a February interview , said the state’s proposal suggested “just taking the Obama numbers and stretching that an additional year. And that doesn’t really get to the lives saved or the reducing the price of the automobiles to where we would like it to be.”

The White House abandoned discussions with California officials a few weeks later, saying, “Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative” after the federal proposal was released.

The four-company pact with California also highlights a growing chasm between the Trump administration and the auto industry, which after urging the administration to retool Obama-era mileage standards has since pushed back on the resulting plan that recommended capping requirements after 2020.

That plan, put forth last year by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also proposed stripping California of its authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions. The state and others have vowed to fight in court to retain that power, and automakers fear that prolonged litigation will roil business plans that depend on predictable fuel economy standards.

In June, a group of 17 major carmakers unsuccessfully asked Trump to resume talks with California, saying a pact for unified California-U.S. standards will “enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability.”

California’s deal with the four carmakers — and the one pitched to the EPA last fall — pushes the 2025 efficiency target back to 2026, lowering the pace of gains each year compared to the current rules starting in 2022. Automakers would get more help to reach those targets from additional compliance credits earned by selling electric vehicles, and wouldn’t have to account for carbon emissions by the power plants that generate electricity used by battery-powered cars.

“For over a year and a half, the administration expended a serious amount of resources to achieve a workable deal with California,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an email, adding, “not once did California submit a meaningful alternative.”

Dave Cooke, a senior clean-vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said California’s offer contained meaningful concessions.

“The fact that this was the deal that EPA called not serious is incredible to me,” he said. “This is a substantial reduction in stringency from the federal program.”"

Joseph Cuffari, a one-time adviser to Gov. Doug Ducey and former Gov. Jan Brewer, is President Donald Trump’s new inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security.

Cuffari, who has lived in Phoenix and Tucson with his family and is relocating to the Washington, D.C.-area, has served more than four decades in the U.S. Air Force, on active duty in the Reserves and in the Arizona Air Guard.

“It was a great honor to have been considered by the president for nomination, and confirmed by the full Senate to be able to continue to serve the American people,” Cuffari, 59, said Tuesday.

Trump announced his intent to nominate Cuffari in October 2018. The Senate confirmed him on a voice vote on July 25.

Over the years, Cuffari worked in leadership positions with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General and other investigative and government roles in the United States and abroad.

Now, he will oversee independent analysis of the programs and operations of Homeland Security.

He told the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee in March he is committed to “seek the truth” while judiciously exercising his role.

“It is in that spirit that I will be fair and objective in my undertakings to investigate, audit, and inspect departmental employees and operations,” his statement read.

Brewer, a Republican who tapped Cuffari to advise her on public safety policies, said she was thrilled with his confirmation.

“He is going to serve POTUS very, very well,” she said. “He’s got an extremely impressive background and we were all very pleased when he served in my administration. I recommended him and was just really thrilled that it got done.”

Cuffari advised Ducey on military and veterans-affairs issues.

""Joe has been a valuable member of our team for the last four years,"" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said in an email. ""We were sad to see him go but excited for his confirmation and glad he'll be continuing his career of service at the Department of Homeland Security.""

Don't Expect Every Question Answered by USDA's August Report,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/dont-expect-every-question-answered-usdas-august-report,"Grain markets settling down Tuesday following turbulence to start the week after what seems like an escalation in the trade war with China. Corn futures at the CME Group in Chicago have seen a steady march lower since last month.

In an interview on AgDay TV with Clinton Griffiths, Mark Gold of Top Third Ag Marketing says the issue is that the weather just hasn't been that bad since the rains slowed down in late June.

""We know that the pollination is way late,"" says Gold. ""We haven't had a whole lot of rain these last seven days, we're not going to get a whole lot in the next seven days but it's been enough.""

While there are spotty issues with dryness and heat, Gold says temperatures haven't been overly hot.

""There's not a whole lot of stress out there,"" says Gold. ""The big question is on the supply side and what are the acres?""

Gold thinks ultimately both yields and acres will trend lower in USDA's subsequent reports.

""I don't think the USDA is going to see a huge reduction in the acres from the last report, mainly because they're going to be including all those acres for silage,"" says Gold. ""One of the secretaries came out and said corn planted is corn planted and that means they're just going to lump it all together.""

Gold doesn't think the industry will get every answer they want in the August report. Regardless, he's expecting the market to react to the updated information.

""If the report is friendly, then obviously we can move a lot higher,"" says Gold. ""If they don't really make any changes in the numbers, the yield is still 165 or 166, we're going lower and maybe significantly lower.""

Gold says the biggest issue he sees on the horizon is softening demand given the trade issues facing the industry.

""We've got to offset that,"" says Gold. ""Even if we offset a 10% reduction in production, we're seeing a 10% reduction in demand.""​

EIS process launched for US fast neutron reactor,http://www.world-nuclear-news.org,[],,,,http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/EIS-process-launched-for-US-fast-neutron-reactor,"EIS process launched for US fast neutron reactor

06 August 2019

Share

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has formally announced the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the construction of a Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) to test fuels and materials for use in advanced civilian nuclear power reactors.

DOE's vision of the VTR (Image: DOE)

A Notice of Intent was published yesterday in the US Federal Register, in which the DOE invites public comment on what should be included in the scope of the EIS in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations. The EIS will evaluate alternatives for a versatile reactor-based fast-neutron source facility and associated facilities for the preparation, irradiation and post-irradiation examination of fuels and materials.

US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the testing capability offered by the VTR would be ""essential"" for the USA to modernise its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing ""transformational nuclear energy technologies"" to reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security. ""Lack of a domestic reactor with versatile fast-neutron-spectrum testing capability is a significant national strategic risk affecting the ability of DOE to fulfil its mission to advance the energy, environmental, and nuclear security of the United States and promote scientific and technological innovation,"" he said.

Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Rita Baranwal said the capability must be developed on an ""accelerated schedule"" to avoid delays in the country's ability to develop and deploy advanced nuclear energy technologies. ""If this capability is not available to US innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the US nuclear industrial sector,"" she said.

The VTR will be used to provide a source of fast neutrons to support the development of advanced reactor technologies. Such facilities are currently available in only a few locations worldwide and the USA has not operated one in over 20 years. The DOE was directed to develop the facility under the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which became law in September 2018.

The reactor is to be a smaller (about 300 MWt) version of the GE Hitachi PRISM power reactor, which builds on the EBR-II, an integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype that operated at Argonne National Laboratory from 1963 to 1994. VTR, like PRISM, would use metallic alloy fuels. DOE has previously said the facility could be in operation by the end of 2026.

DOE is required by NEPA to evaluate ""a range of reasonable alternatives"" for the construction and operation of a VTR and its associated facilities, including a ""No Action Alternative"" to serve as a basis for comparison with the action alternatives. The ""action alternatives"" are described in the Federal Register announcement as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) VTR Alternative and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) VTR Alternative.

The INL VTR Alternative would see the VTR sited at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC), using existing hot-cell and other facilities at the MFC for post-irradiation examination. The site's current infrastructure ""should be largely adequate"" to support the facility, according to the DOE. Under this alternative, fuel for the VTR would be manufactured either at MFC or at the Savanah River Site in South Carolina.

Under the ORNL VTR Alternative, the reactor would be sited at a yet-to-be-identified location at ORNL, which is in eastern Tennessee. Several existing facilities would be used and/or modified to provide operational support and post-irradiation examination capabilities. Driver fuel for the VTR would ""likely be manufactured elsewhere,"" according to the Federal Register notice.

The public has until 4 September to submit comments on the scope of the draft version of the EIS. The draft EIS itself will then be completed over the next several months and will itself be opened to public comment before being made final.

The Cybersecurity 202: Here's how the Justice Department wants to befriend ethical hackers,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joseph Marks', 'Reporter For The Cybersecurity Newsletter', 'August At Am']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/08/07/the-cybersecurity-202-here-s-how-the-justice-department-wants-to-befriend-ethical-hackers/5d49ace188e0fa1454f801cf/,"THE KEY

The seal of the US Department of Justice on a podium (ERIK S LESSER/EPA-EFE/REX)

LAS VEGAS — The Justice Department's relationship with the cybersecurity research community has historically been tempestuous, but Leonard Bailey is on a mission to improve it.

That's what brings him here, to the BSides cybersecurity conference. The head of the cybersecurity unit of DOJ’s computer crimes division is extending an open invitation today to ethical hackers to air some grievances and offer policy advice, in a talk called: “Let’s Hear from the Hackers: What Should DOJ do Next?”

Bailey wants to ensure hackers are willing to work with government on improving cybersecurity -- instead of staying away because they're suspicious of government.

“It's about figuring out how to make sure that their ability to help us improve [the nation’s] cybersecurity is not taken off the playing field,” Bailey tells me. “They have a valuable resource and they can be helping everyone.”

This marks a drastic change — in terms of both outreach and attitude -- from previous years. Tensions have soared as ethical hackers accused DOJ of being too quick to prosecute them for benign research aimed at improving cybersecurity -- and of not being transparent enough about the rules for what constitutes a digital crime.

Bailey's office has worked for four years to ease some of these tension points, he said, including by helping develop Copyright Office rules, which make it tougher for companies to use copyright laws to scare off ethical hackers from searching for dangerous bugs in their software, and publishing guidance that clarifies when hackers are likely to fall afoul of the nation’s major anti-hacking law, the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

“[Before], we were building a bridge” of trust, he told me. “Now, we’ve developed some strong relationships where we can have policy discussions.”

Bailey’s likely to run into some serious headwinds, though. While a majority of cybersecurity experts surveyed by The Cybersecurity 202 said this week that the relationship between hackers and government officials has gotten better in the last several years, they also pointed out some major points of conflict.

Most ethical hackers strongly oppose Attorney General William P. Barr’s push to stop companies from offering encrypted communication systems that prevent police from accessing communications with a warrant. And they say the Computer Fraud and Abuse act is still used too broadly to punish hackers — with many pointing to the case of Marcus Hutchins, a British security researcher who helped stem the damage from the massive WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 but was charged under the CFAA a few months later for developing and selling malicious software.

Bailey acknowledged the conflict. He joked in a 2016 address that when he first met with ethical hackers at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015 “only half [of the meeting] was being yelled at.” In succeeding years, he says, those conversations have become far less hostile and more productive. Now, he says ethical hackers frequently call him to talk over policy disagreements.

One of the big things Bailey wants to talk with ethical hackers about today is ways they can work with government to help warn young people who are skilled with computers away from criminal hacking or digital vandalism that might land them in trouble with the law.

“Kids who are tech savvy are having earlier and earlier access to valuable tools for learning hard skills like coding, but they may not also be getting information about how to use that power responsibly,” he said.

The Justice Department is examining offering grants for organizations to write ethical hacking curriculum for high schools or community organizations, he said. They’re also looking for ways to reach out to places where they might find tech savvy teens, such as the video gaming community.

But he’s hoping the hacking community will take up the issue, too, and launch its own education efforts.

“It's very difficult for the government to shape a message here, to say ‘hey kids, don't hack.’ That doesn't really have a lot of purchase,” he told me. “So, we’re trying to figure out whether there are ways of leveraging the community to help us with that messaging.”

PINGED: A second election security non-profit has announced it will offer free cybersecurity protections to 2020 presidential campaigns following a May Federal Elections Commission opinion that said non-profits can offer those services without falling afoul of campaign finance laws.

The newly-formed non-profit U.S. CyberDome boasts an all-star board of directors including former Homeland Security chiefs Jeh Johnson and Michael Chertoff and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Defending Digital Democracy, the non-profit that sought the FEC ruling, is run by Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, and Matt Rhoades, Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign manager.

CyberDome will offer services including protection against password thefts and ransomware using a patchwork of different vendors and technologies, founder Joseph Drissel told Tim Starks at Politico.

“It’s not a question of ‘if’ a campaign will be hacked or trolled, it’s a question of ‘when’,” Drissel said in a statement. The group hopes to expand its services to congressional elections over time.

The FEC also gave the greenlight to a private cybersecurity firm, Area 1 Security, to provide “low- to no-cost” protections against phishing attacks to 2020 campaigns in July.

PATCHED: The Department of Justice indicted a 34-year-old Pakistani man for paying more than $1 million in bribes to AT&T workers to plant malware and surveillance software on corporate computers and devices, Forbes’ Thomas Brewster reports.

The malware allowed Muhammad Fahd to collect confidential data that helped him to unlock phones and sell them on the black market for far more than he would have earned for locked phones. Fahd and the employees he bribed unlocked 2 million phones over the five years they ran the scam -- defrauding AT&T of tens of millions of dollars. The malware didn't allow Fahd access to consumer data, Brewster reported.

Fahd, who was extradited to the U.S. from Hong Kong this month, faces up to 20 years in jail.

The decade-long exposure highlights how campaigns are collecting more and more data about their donors but not sufficiently improving their security at the same time.

Researchers at the security firm UpGuard found the unprotected data hosted on Amazon cloud storage without a password in July. After tracing the data back to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, researchers notified the organization and the DSCC secured the data. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

The data was stored in files dated to 2010 that included ""Clinton"" in the name, suggesting campaign campaign staff may have collected the data during fundraising efforts for Hillary Clinton's 2010 Senate run, Whittaker reports. DSCC denied the claim to TechCrunch but did not disclose how it collected the data or if the data had been accessed while exposed. The server contained private and government email addresses.

""If political data can be exposed for 10 years, the risk created by that data has an unknown half-life,"" researchers at UpGuard wrote in a blog post. Researchers could not determine if hackers accessed any of the data while it was unsecured.

""A spreadsheet from nearly a decade ago that was created for fundraising purposes was removed in compliance with the stringent protocols we now have in place,"" DSCC spokesperson Stewart Boss wrote in an email.

Correction: This article originally misstated what data the exposed Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee server contained. It contained private and government emails.

SC officials press for $200 million fines against Energy Department over plutonium,https://www.postandcourier.com,"['Colin Demarest Cdemarest Aikenstandard.Com', 'Colin Demarest', 'Thad Moore', 'Book']",,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/news/sc-officials-press-for-million-fines-against-energy-department-over/article_a25b8ed4-b86e-11e9-bc7b-6f70c1d0e6a1.html,"About one month after South Carolina disclosed that settlement negotiations with the federal government had collapsed, the state is again urging a federal court to swiftly grant it a multimillion-dollar payout related to plutonium stored at the Savannah River Site, a sprawling nuclear reserve south of Aiken.

South Carolina's legal team, led by Attorney General Alan Wilson, on July 31 asked the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for a $200 million summary judgment in its favor, arguing money is and has been available for it.

The amount sought represents two years of fines levied against the U.S. Department of Energy for not removing weapons-grade plutonium from the Savannah River Site.

The South Carolina team said it had previously identified ""multiple"" sources for the payout, and Congress never prohibited the Energy Department from completing the payments.

Federal law mandated — beginning Jan. 1, 2016 — that DOE pay South Carolina $1 million for each day, up to 100 days per year, that the department failed to process plutonium at its Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility or get 1 metric ton of the material out of the state.

The MOX facility was designed to convert plutonium into fuel for commercial nuclear power plants, but it was still unfinished when DOE axed the project last year after more than a decade of work and billions of dollars spent. The department ""chose to not remove the defense plutonium, thereby obligating it to provide the"" payments, according to South Carolina's 10-page filing.

In sharp contrast to the Palmetto State's position, the Energy Department last summer argued it could not disburse the millions of dollars because funds for it were not in place.

""Because the United States is not liable in the absence of available appropriations, the court must dismiss the complaint,"" one of the federal government's court filings reads.

About 12 metric tons of surplus plutonium was kept at the site as of mid-May, according to a National Nuclear Security Administration official. Only some of that was bound for MOX. A majority of the plutonium meant for MOX never reached the site, the same NNSA official said.

South Carolina and the federal government had been in the negotiation process for months to resolve the dispute over the fines.

An impasse was recognized near the end of June, when the state's legal team said the U.S. Department of Justice wasn't engaging with them and had only provided a single ""lowball"" counteroffer."
"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"

The seesaw market action highlights what could be the beginning of a wild ride for investors as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a never-ending trade battle.

“I think what we, the market should expect is continuing volatility for the foreseeable future,” Stefan Selig, former under secretary of commerce for international trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce, told Yahoo Finance’s On the Move. “This is going to be a continuing pattern, where you're going to have increased tensions between the two sides, no easy resolution to what is a highly complex issue. I think the president and the administration losing patience, then they weigh in with some other initiative, whether it's labeling China a currency manipulator or adding Huawei and other companies to the entity list or raising tariffs or increasing the breadth of tariffs.”

On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it does not expect a trade truce to come before the 2020 election, leading many to wonder what the White House hopes to achieve.

“The question is, what are we waiting for?,” said Selig. “If we're waiting for some grand bargain that addresses all of the commercial and economic issues we have with China, that is not going to happen anytime soon… Are we going to fundamentally get them to reform their economy with that large state-owned enterprise sector? I think that is not going to happen anytime soon. And this could be, frankly, a generational struggle.”

For the time being, there Is no end in sight. The next round of trade talks are scheduled to take place next month when Chinese representatives are expected to visit the U.S.

“The ability for the United States and the Western economies to accommodate a large, non-market economy like China, we've never done this before, so we have no experience,” Selig said. “And as a result of that, we really don't have any sort of blueprint to really go forward with.”

"Former DHS, intelligence leaders launch group to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference",https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/456448-former-dhs-intelligence-leaders-launch-group-to-protect-presidential,"Two former Homeland Security secretaries, along with other former top intelligence officials, launched a non-profit group on Tuesday intended to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference, such as cyber attacks, at no cost.

The new U.S. CyberDome group’s Board of Advisors will be chaired by former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson, who served under former President Obama.

Other members of the board will include former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under President George W.

James Clapper James Robert ClapperFormer DHS, intelligence leaders launch group to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference Senate braces for brawl over Trump's spy chief A brief timeline of Trump's clashes with intelligence director Dan Coats MORE, and Brig. Gen. Francis Taylor, the former DHS under secretary of Intelligence and Analysis.

The former leaders put together the organization due to alarm over how exposed political campaigns were to cyber interference and the lack of protection available to campaigns and voters to protect against these threats. It will work with charities and other donors to provide funding for cyber protections for presidential campaigns.

While U.S. CyberDome’s initial efforts will be focused on securing 2020 presidential campaigns against threats, the group aims to eventually assist all national political campaigns.

“In the face of known, on-going efforts by foreign powers to try to interfere in our upcoming election, U.S. CyberDome could not come at a more critical juncture,"" Johnson said in a statement.

Chertoff added, “U.S. CyberDome believes that all Americans should enlist in the protection of our democratic institutions, and fortifying Cybersecurity in our political organizations is a key element in this initiative.”

Morrell emphasized that the group’s services will apply to all presidential campaigns regardless of party, and that U.S. CyberDome is comprised of a “group of talented, experienced cyber security experts doing what they can to keep the Russians, Chinese, and other adversaries from stealing critical information from the 2020 candidates.”"

""I can't explain debt to her,"" Marler, 29, said. ""And how I went to school and it was all for nothing.""

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

A federal judge ruled last year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' delays of an Obama-era regulation aimed at forgiving the student debt of defrauded students were illegal. Still, advocates say, the department continues to neglect the applications of those like Marler."
"From contamination to commercial hubs, how EPA Superfund sites are being transformed",https://www.ksl.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Ksl', 'Posted - Aug']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46612091/from-contamination-to-commercial-hubs-how-epa-superfund-sites-are-being-transformed,"MIDVALE — A 700-acre site in Midvale was once home to five smelters processing lead and copper ore, covered with blast furnaces, baghouses and smokestacks.

Decades of industrial activity infused the land and groundwater with heavy metal contamination, rendering it full of toxins dangerous to human health.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund initiative, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, transformed the landscape to a useable piece of property after cleanup, with remediation and monitoring that went on for more than a decade.

Bingham Junction is now home to a park, 1,000 residences, and retail and commercial development that supports 600 jobs, $1.5 million in annual property tax revenues and a $131 million increase in the value of the property site.

The Midvale site was one of four highlighted in a release by the EPA, which works in conjunction with state agencies like the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and community partners like cities and redevelopment agencies.

Overall, approximately 1,000 Superfund sites are in reuse today — more than half the number of sites on the Superfund’s National Priorities List.

EPA has data on over 8,600 businesses at 529 of these sites, according to its release.

In fiscal year 2018 alone, these businesses generated $52.4 billion in sales, which is more than four times the amount EPA has spent at these sites. These businesses employed more than 195,000 people who earned a combined income of $13 billion. Over the last seven years, these businesses generated at least $263 billion in sales.

Much work remains to be done, however.

Hundreds of sites across the United States remain in the remediation stage and others have yet to make the list.

In Utah alone, there are 26 sites that were designated for the Superfund list since the program started in 1999. Among those still on the list are a 450-acre contaminated groundwater plume in Woods Cross and Bountiful, the Davenport and Flagstaff smelters site in Sandy and until recently, the Eureka Mills site in Juab County.

In 2018, that site was removed from the Superfund list.

Mass Shooting Legislation -- DOJ Studying Proposal That Would Make Mass Shootings a Capital Crime,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Jack Crowe', 'David French', 'The Editors', 'Charles C. W. Cooke', 'John Fund', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'Rich Lowry', 'Robert Verbruggen', 'Read More', 'The American Conservative']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/doj-studying-proposal-that-would-make-mass-shootings-a-capital-crime/,"The Justice Department building stands in Washington, D.C., February 1, 2018. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)

In response to the mass shootings that took place over the weekend, the Department of Justice has begun studying the impact of legislation that would make such attacks a capital crime.

Attorney General William Barr discussed the proposal as one of a number of potential responses to the two attacks that together claimed 31 lives over the weekend, CNN reported Monday.

Currently, federal law holds that the death penalty can be applied in cases where an attacker uses a weapon of mass destruction, such as an explosive, but has no similar provision for mass-casualty attacks perpetrated with a firearm. When mass-shootings occur, federal prosecutors resort to other laws, such as those criminalizing hate crimes, to secure the maximum possible sentence.

In order to draft legislation, Congress would have to define what qualifies as a “mass-shooting.” The FBI defines such shootings as those with four or more victims, while previous federal legislation defined them as those in which three or more people are shot.

At least 22 people were killed in El Paso, Texas on Saturday after a lone gunman opened fire in a Walmart. The perpetrator, who is currently in federal custody, drafted an anti-immigrant manifesto that detailed his motivations for the attack. He may face hate-crime charges in addition to capital-murder charges.

Another nine people were killed hours after the El Paso attack in the downtown district of Dayton, Ohio, after a young man opened fire on night-time revelers with a semi-automatic rifle. The shooter was killed on the scene after exchanging fire with police officers.

President Trump addressed the nation Monday morning, issuing a call for national unity and lamenting the “culture” of violence propagated by movies and video games. He did not mention gun-control legislation.

In a statement issued Monday, Democratic leaders urged Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call lawmakers back from their August recess to advance background-check legislation that was passed by the Democrat-controlled House earlier this year."

Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield announced today that Brenda Tuck has been hired as the department’s first rural development manager.

Tuck will assist rural counties and communities in competing for job-creating projects, providing technical assistance and training.

It’s an area she knows well. She previously served in economic development positions in Marengo, Dallas and Wilcox counties and has been regional workforce council liaison to the Commerce Department’s Workforce Development Division. She also spent seven years as a partner with Selma consulting firm Alford & Associates and five years in economic development at Pioneer Electric Cooperative.

Tuck said she looks forward to working with rural counties and their leaders.

“Rural communities in Alabama can benefit from having a go-to person who can connect them with the resources they need to improve their economic development prospects,” Tuck said.

Alabama in recent years has made a priority of rural economic development through several initiatives. In 2015 the state began offering incentives to qualified projects in targeted counties as a bid to spur rural job creation. The Commerce Department says about 16 projects have qualified, with about $1 billion in investments and 1,400 jobs. This year the Alabama Legislature approved increasing the number of counties eligible for enhanced incentives.

Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said Tuck’s background makes her “the ideal choice to help rural communities navigate the economic development process.”

“Brenda has extensive experience working on the front lines of economic development in rural Alabama counties, so she knows the specific challenges these areas face when it comes to competing for projects,” Canfield said."

CISA noted that these emails and attachments could direct users to malware-infected websites.

“Emails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations are also common after tragic events,” CISA wrote in the alert. “Be wary of fraudulent social media pleas, calls, texts, donation websites, and door-to-door solicitations relating to these events.”

CISA recommended that users not click links or open email attachments in unsolicited emails, and that users practice caution when donating to charities that link themselves to the El Paso and Dayton shootings.

The CISA alert was issued the same day the FBI’s El Paso office also warned Americans to watch out for scams in relation to the recent El Paso shooting.

In this case, the FBI warned of phone calls purporting to raise money for a funeral home or pay for medical examiner expenses of victims. The FBI noted that if someone received that call to not give them money, and report them to authorities."

He Has Covered Rail', 'Trucking', 'Maritime Issues Since For A Variety Of Publications Based In The U.S.', 'The U.K. John Began Business Reporting In At Broadcasting', 'Cable Magazine. He Graduated Florida State University Majoring In English']",08-05-2019,2019,8,http://www.freightwaves.com/news/watchdog-agency-clears-epas-glider-truck-testing-practices,"Testing by federal regulators in 2017 that found air pollution from glider kits to be “many times” the level generated by new heavy-duty truck engines complied with approved standards, a government watchdog agency has found.

A July 31 audit conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General (EPA OIG) also confirmed that EPA staff have not been directed to work on a 2017 proposed rule that would have exempted glider trucks from stricter Phase 2 emissions requirements. That means that a 300-truck per manufacturer cap on glider kits remains in place.

Glider kits are a way for truck owners to buy a new truck with a remanufactured engine, often at a significant discount from a new truck and engine combination.

The OIG audit was conducted at the request of Republican lawmakers. Last year they questioned EPA’s testing processes at its National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which were used in a 2017 EPA study on glider truck emissions. Opponents of the study, which found air emissions from gliders to be 43 to 55 times those of trucks with modern emission controls, also argued that Volvo [CXE: VOLVB.S.IX] had influenced the findings. Volvo and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have supported tighter emissions controls after years of investing in clean-engine technology.

Both EPA and Volvo were cleared in the OIG’s audit. “The EPA complied with standard practices and relevant policies and procedures covering objectivity and integrity in planning and conducting its testing of glider vehicles in 2017,” according to the audit.

The OIG concluded that employees within EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) had received the required testing approvals and followed normal procedures in submitting the glider testing report. “The OIG also did not identify ethics violations within the scope of our audit by a former OTAQ Center Director.”

The audit did find minor issues with how EPA exercised its “donation acceptance authority” when officials there acquired the trucks used for its study. The OIG recommended that EPA officials evaluate whether it needs to develop further guidance or policies on accepting donated property.

The audit marks the latest development in a long-running controversy over how much glider kits pollute. Because the kits can be roughly 25 percent less costly than new truck cabs, they are in high demand by independent fleet operators from manufacturers such as Crossville, Tennessee-based Fitzgerald Glider Kits.

Fitzgerald commissioned a study conducted by Tennessee Technological University (Tennessee Tech) in 2017 that found glider engines do not pollute any more than modern OEM systems. The Tennessee Tech study was then used to lobby on behalf of a measure that allows rebuilt diesel engines to be exempt from the Obama-era emissions rules.

But university faculty questioned the pro-glider kit study, in particular the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university, calling it a conflict of interest. In late 2018, Tennessee Tech acknowledged that the results of its glider kit study were inaccurate.
