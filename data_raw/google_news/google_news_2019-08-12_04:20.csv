Border chief explains why there have been no ICE raids at Trump properties,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/11/20801066/border-chief-mark-morgan-ice-raids-trump-businesses,"Acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner Mark Morgan dodged questions about reports of undocumented workers at Trump Organization properties Sunday morning.

On CNN’s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper asked Morgan why Immigration and Customs Enforcement — which Morgan led until early July — hadn’t conducted any raids or investigations into Trump’s eight properties given reports that the clubs and hotels employ undocumented people.

“You really can’t say that for sure,” Morgan said. “There are investigations going on all the time that you’re unaware of. ... Of course it’s going to jeopardize the investigation if I come on here and I talk to you about an investigation that’s going on.”

The question came days after a massive ICE raid on a Mississippi chicken processing plant. The worksite raid was one of the largest of its kind in US history; 680 people suspected to be unauthorized workers were abruptly arrested and separated from their families.

Tapper asked why employers who hire undocumented workers are not always punished along with the workers themselves; the host cited Syracuse University’s immigration records research that found only 11 people and no companies were prosecuted for employing undocumented workers between the spring of 2018 and 2019. During the same time frame, 85,727 people were prosecuted for entering the US illegally.

Morgan responded that an investigation into the business that employed the undocumented workers in Mississippi is ongoing.

Among the companies that have not been prosecuted for employing undocumented laborers, however, are those owned by President Trump, despite the Trump Organization having reportedly hired undocumented workers for decades.

What we know about hiring at Trump properties

Multiple news outlets have reported on the Trump Organization’s longstanding reliance on the very people the president often discusses with derision: undocumented immigrants.

Most recently, the Washington Post reported on construction crews at Trump properties being comprised of largely of undocumented workers, even after Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons and a Trump Organization executive, said the company was making a “broad effort” to identify and fire undocumented laborers. One worker told the Post he was even instructed by a supervisor to buy fake documents on a street corner in New York City.

Employing workers without legal status gives the company a competitive advantage, industry officials told the Post. And undocumented laborers are less likely to risk job changes and are less likely to complain if they’re being mistreated.

Trump “doesn’t want undocumented people in the country,” one former Trump Organization worker, Jorge Castro, told the Post. “But at his properties, he still has them.”

Trump’s businesses rely heavily on documented foreign laborers as well. As Vox’s Alexia Fernández Campbell reported, the Trump Organization makes use of the US’ H-2B visa program. Campbell found that only one out of 144 jobs available at Trump properties during 2016 and 2017 went to an American worker, and that the Trump administration has expanded access to H-2B visas:

The H-2B visa program allows seasonal, non-agricultural employers — like hotels and ski resorts — to hire foreign workers when they can’t find American ones. The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers.

Employers are supposed to attempt to find American workers before hiring H-2B immigrants, Fernández Campbell reported, but documents showed Trump Organization hiring managers made the minimum required effort to recruit US citizens to fill the open positions.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fernández Campbell that the company’s reliance on H-2B visa holders, and Trump’s expansion of the program in 2017, creates a competitive advantage similar to the one gained by employing mostly undocumented workers: being able to avoid paying higher wages or better benefits for American workers.

There aren’t enough low-skilled American workers to fill demand

The Trump Organization has said it is making efforts to ensure all of its workers are citizens or documented immigrants. The company has fired nearly two dozen people due to their immigration status since the New York Times reported on undocumented workers at the Trump Organization’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey last December, and has adopted a system for verifying employment eligibility.

But firing undocumented workers — and instituting widespread policies intended to flush them out of the US labor market — may have the unintended consequence of placing stress on an economy desperately in need of low-skill workers.

As Fernández Campbell reported:

There’s practically no way for a low-skilled worker from Guatemala to “wait in line” for a visa to take a job at a chicken processing plant in Mississippi. Only one such visa exists — the EB-3 visa — but it’s limited to a tiny number of people (5,000 max). Yet the US economy needs hundreds of thousands of workers to fill these jobs right now. The US is experiencing a serious labor shortage, and it’s harder for businesses to find low-skilled workers these days than high-skilled workers.

As president, Trump has pushed an immigration plan that favors migrants prepared for high-skill jobs, that gives advantages to immigrants with advanced college degrees. But those jobs are, for the most part, already filled. There are a surplus of jobs available for low-skilled workers, however, and not enough Americans to fill them.

Immigrants who want to take those open jobs have two options, Fernández Campbell writes: The H-2A program for farm workers and the H-2B program for seasonal workers, such as those working at Trump hotels. There are only around 75,000 visas available annually for those guest workers, and they don’t cover jobs like those at the plant raided last week in Mississippi.

The limits on those visas and the need to staff low-skill positions have been some the main reasons behind a spike in undocumented immigrants in the US since the 1990s, according to Madeleine Sumption and Demetrios Papademetriou of the Migration Policy Institute. There simply aren’t that many ways immigrants looking for low-skilled work can legally get work in the US.

Trump’s policies may make the labor shortage worse, industry experts say, including at his own properties. If he hopes to keep the economy growing, it will require rethinking restrictive policies that have been the cornerstone of his platform."

Epstein’s accusers call her his protector and procurer. Is Ghislaine Maxwell now prosecutors’ target?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Marc Fisher', 'Senior Editor Reporting On A Wide Range Of Topics', 'August At Pm']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/epsteins-accusers-call-her-his-protector-and-procurer-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-prosecutors-target/2019/08/11/7af5968a-bbbd-11e9-a091-6a96e67d9cce_story.html,"From left, Donald Trump and his then-girlfriend and future wife Melania Knauss, Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. (Davidoff Studios Photography/Getty Images)

Ghislaine Maxwell was, according to her accusers, Jeffrey Epstein’s protector and procurer, his girlfriend and his madam. She was, by all accounts, a soul mate and a mirror image. He grew up in Brooklyn with no money to speak of and never finished college. She is Paris-born, Oxford-educated, a jet-setter who partied with princes and billionaires.

Together, Epstein and Maxwell allegedly built what prosecutors, police and a growing number of women described as a sex-trafficking operation that crisscrossed the nation to provide Epstein with three young girls a day.

The death of Epstein, the convicted sex offender who authorities said hanged himself in a federal detention center cell in New York on Saturday, leaves those who seek to hold someone responsible for the alleged abuse of dozens of girls with one prime target: Maxwell.

The U.S. attorney in New York, Geoff Berman, assured the “brave young women who have already come forward and . . . the many others who have yet to do so” that “our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment — which included a conspiracy count — remains ongoing.”

[For 30 years, prosecutors and victims tried to hold Jeffrey Epstein to account. At every turn, he slipped away.]

According to many of the women who have spoken about what Epstein allegedly did to them, Maxwell was the financier’s chief co-conspirator.

Maxwell, 57, has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing. According to people familiar with the investigation, authorities have had trouble locating Maxwell, who is believed to be living abroad. Her five-story Manhattan townhouse was sold in 2016 for $15 million by a company that used the address of Epstein’s New York office.

Her lawyers told a judge in 2017 that she was in London, but had no fixed address. Lawyers representing Epstein’s alleged victims said they wouldn’t expect Maxwell to return to the United States anytime soon for fear of being arrested.

Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the nonprofit Human Trafficking Legal Center, said she was “thrilled” to hear the prosecutors’ announcement that the investigation would continue, saying it would encourage more alleged victims to come forward.

For someone who stood by Epstein through the most sordid allegations, Maxwell was also a factor in his downfall: It was through a 2015 defamation lawsuit filed against Maxwell by one of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, that thousands of pages of documents containing detailed accounts of Epstein’s alleged abuses became public last week.

But Maxwell herself had long since slipped away. Although associates of Epstein said Maxwell never completely broke off relations with Epstein, she became far less of a presence at his various properties in recent years.

[Epstein’s accusers still deserve justice and will go after his alleged enablers, their lawyers say]

Maxwell was a focus of the Epstein investigation from the start, according to the Palm Beach police officials who began the probe. The girls they interviewed repeatedly described Maxwell as the coordinator of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. But detectives were never able to interview Maxwell.

Attorneys for Maxwell did not return calls seeking comment. Throughout the years since Epstein was first accused of sexual abuse, Maxwell has insisted that she did nothing wrong and knew of no illegal acts. In a deposition she gave in Giuffre’s defamation suit in 2016, Maxwell said that “Virginia is an absolute liar and everything she has said is a lie. Therefore, based on those lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else did or didn’t do . . . everything she said is false.” The suit was settled out of court in 2017.

But a growing number of women have said that Maxwell was the prime organizer of Epstein’s three-times daily “massages,” and that she acted as recruiter and paymaster for the girls who came to Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.

Giuffre said Maxwell recruited her in 2000, when she was 16 or 17 and working at Donald Trump’s Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago.

As Giuffre recalled it in her lawsuit, Maxwell told her, “I know somebody. We can train you. We can get you educated. You know, we can help you along the way if you pass the interview. If the guy likes you, then, you know, it will work out for you. You’ll travel. You’ll make good money.”

But at her first meeting with Epstein, Giuffre said in a deposition, Maxwell “instructed me to take off my clothes and to give oral sex to Jeffrey Epstein.”

In an interview with the Miami Herald last year, Giuffre said, “The training started immediately. It was everything down to . . . how to be quiet, be subservient, give Jeffrey what he wants. A lot of this training came from Ghislaine herself, and being a woman, it kind of surprises you that a woman could actually let stuff like that happen. But not only let it happen but to groom you into doing it.”

Giuffre also said that Maxwell ordered her to have sex with Prince Andrew, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson (D) and former Senate majority leader George J. Mitchell (D-Maine).

“My whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and Jeffrey happy,” Giuffre said in the deposition. “Their whole entire lives revolved around sex.”

Spokesmen for Richardson and Mitchell vigorously denied Giuffre’s allegations and said they never had any contact with her. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said, “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.”

Asked in a deposition about Maxwell’s role in procuring girls for him, Epstein said only, “Fifth,” referring to his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.

Johanna Sjoberg, a student at Palm Beach Atlantic University when she said Maxwell hired her as an assistant, said in a 2015 deposition that was released Friday that it was Maxwell’s job to ensure that three girls a day were made available to Epstein for his sexual pleasure.

“He needed to have three orgasms a day,” Sjoberg said. “It was biological, like eating.”

In another document released Friday, Rinaldo Rizzo, the houseman for one of Epstein’s closest friends testified that a 15-year-old Swedish girl tearfully told him that Maxwell and Epstein had threatened her with physical harm and confiscated her passport to assure that she stayed on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.

Yet another woman has claimed that Maxwell not only recruited girls for Epstein, but took part in the sexual abuse of girls. Maria Farmer said in an affidavit earlier this year that she met Maxwell and Epstein at an art show when she was a graduate student in Manhattan in 1995. The next summer, Farmer said, both Maxwell and Epstein sexually assaulted her at the Ohio estate of Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of The Limited stores and Epstein’s only publicly known financial client. Farmer also said that Maxwell took part in the sexual abuse of her 15-year-old sister on a massage table at Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico.

Through her years with Epstein, Maxwell maintained a very public life at the pinnacle of society. She was a friend of John F. Kennedy Jr. in New York in the 1990s and a guest at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in 2010. She had a long relationship with an Italian count. She attended fashion shows and top-dollar benefit balls in New York and London and went to the Vanity Fair party at the Oscars, where she was photographed in 2014 with Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur.

In 2000, she obtained her townhouse on Manhattan’s East 65th Street; it was purchased for her for $5 million by an anonymous corporation located at the same address as Epstein’s finance office.

Maxwell served on boards of charities and founded a nonprofit organization that sought to conserve the world’s oceans. The organization announced last month that it was ceasing operations.

Describing herself as “unemployed,” Maxwell donated the maximum permissible, $2,300, to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2007.

[Jeffrey Epstein doesn’t deserve to be a conspiracy theory]

In a profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair in 2003, he said that Maxwell was not a paid employee but rather his “best friend.”

But after Epstein’s conviction on sexual abuse charges in 2008, Maxwell appeared to distance herself from her friend.

Maxwell grew up in a 53-room mansion on 14 acres near Oxford. Her father was Robert Maxwell, a British member of Parliament and book and newspaper publisher who was regularly on the front pages until he died mysteriously in 1991 aboard the Lady Ghislaine, a yacht he had named for his youngest daughter. The official ruling was that his death was an accident, but some British press coverage speculated that Maxwell, under pressure because of his enormous debts, killed himself. Ghislaine never believed that and subscribed to the notion that her father was murdered.

In life, the father — born Jan Hoch, a Czech Jewish refu­gee before he transformed himself into a London publisher — carried himself like a man of extreme wealth. When he died, he was found to owe money to more than 40 banks, to the tune of more than $4 billion.

Soon after her father’s death, Ghislaine Maxwell moved to New York. She had a trust fund from her father, which provided her with about $100,000 a year, according to British news reports. But there was no fortune to rely on; she worked in Manhattan selling real estate.

Then, less than a year after her father died, she met Epstein. Maxwell was Epstein’s guide to a heady world of celebrity, wealth, power and royalty. She introduced him to Bill Clinton and to Prince Andrew, who became a frequent visitor to Epstein’s properties. Maxwell and Epstein flew around the world on his private jet and invited top scientists and business leaders to dinners.

Friends said that although their romantic relationship lasted only a few years, she continued to work with or for him long afterward. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach described Maxwell as the house manager, the person who oversaw the staff, handled finances and served as social coordinator, often doing the glad-handing while the more reserved Epstein stayed in the background at parties and dinners.

In 1993, an ad in Yoga Journal offered a “full time position” for an “Iyengar Yoga Instructor” to “teach a private individual.” “The job includes fantastic perks such as extensive travel,” the ad said, and it advised interested parties to call “Miss Maxwell” at a phone number that was Epstein’s office number.

In a deposition in 2016, Maxwell agreed that her work at the Epstein houses “included hiring many people, . . . all sorts of people.” She said that “a very small part of my job was from time to time to find adult professional massage therapists for Jeffrey. As far as I’m concerned, everyone who came to his house was an adult professional person.”

Rep. Al Green wants Trump impeached to help shrink president's 2020 donor list,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Nick Givas', 'Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.

Al Green, D-Texas, said House Democrats should impeach the president to curb his political donor list and stifle his campaign's fundraising efforts ahead of 2020.

Green appeared on MSNBC's ""Weekends with Alex Witt"" on Sunday and cited a poll claiming 51 percent of voters saw Trump as racist. He also said that even if Trump isn't convicted in the Senate, the process would serve to hurt his campaign coffers.

""Fifty-one percent of the American public believes that the president is a racist,"" he said. ""Fifty-one percent... It is one thing to want to defeat the president at the polls, but it’s another thing to understand that we have to impeach the philosophy that he’s perpetrating upon society. If we impeach the philosophy, we take on a broader... threat to society than just defeating him at the polls.""

In a Quinnipiac poll released late last month, 51 percent of voters said President Trump was racist while 45 percent said he was not.

Green added, ""If he is not defeated in the Senate, he will still run as an impeached president and there will be a good many people who won’t want to hold fundraisers with him -- a good many people who won’t want to be in his company because he will become persona non grata to a good many of these wealthy people who are benefitting from his bigotry.""

Green's comments came after Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, was highly criticized for publishing a list of Trump donors who lived and worked in El Paso, following the mass shooting at a Walmart there. Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said actions like this have served only to embolden Trump donors and also have helped create new ones.

The California Democrat also commented on what motivates Trump voters and said most of them voted for the president because of promises he made, but that he's failed to deliver on.

""Here’s the thing. There are people who voted for him for a variety of reasons,"" she said earlier in the interview. ""And a lot of it had to do with the promises he made, which he has not delivered on because they were false promises.

""And he betrayed a lot of people. He came in saying he was going to help working families. Everyone from farmers to auto workers.""

Trump defended the DHS raids to reporters outside the White House on Friday and called them a ""very good deterrent"" to illegal immigration.

""I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent,"" he said.

The operation was carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday and resulted in the detention of 680 illegal immigrants. Agents targeted a food processing plant in Mississippi and swarmed the facility with federal search warrants in hand.

""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said in a statement.

Minneapolis housing authority leads county in evictions,http://www.startribune.com,"['Marissa Evans', 'Marissa.Evans Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-housing-authority-leads-county-in-evictions/535664982/,"The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority has gone to court to evict tenants more than 1,500 times in the past five years, making the county’s largest landlord also its biggest user of housing court, according to data compiled by Hennepin County.

The housing authority oversees more than 6,000 units across Minneapolis, providing homes for low-income residents who are often people with disabilities, older adults or people of color.

While emphasizing that it takes action only against a small number of its tenants, the housing authority is rethinking its approach to evictions amid a larger conversation in the city and across Minnesota over the fairness of the process and the long-term damage an eviction filing has for a prospective renter.

Public housing residents pay up to 30% of their income toward rent. But even with lower rent payments, housing authority officials and tenant advocates have found residents often fall behind due to job loss, reduced work hours or a health emergency.

The agency does not dispute the county’s data, but the numbers do not consider how officials work with residents until “practically at the very last minute to make sure that they stay housed,” said Tracey Scott, interim executive director for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority. “It doesn’t show the whole story about how we do workouts and how we do everything we can to support our residents in keeping their housing.”

Between 2014 and 2018, the agency obtained 462 eviction judgments against tenants and 1,070 that ended with a noneviction judgment, according to a Hennepin County website that tracks these court actions. The county data show the second-largest eviction filer is Huntington Place Apartments, a property in Brooklyn Park that has 834 units.

A noneviction judgment means a landlord may not have shown up for a hearing, the landlord and resident came to an agreement on paying the back rent, or a tenant may have successfully fought off eviction after withholding rent because of maintenance issues.

Tarnishing tenants’ history

Part of the problem with evictions is how long they stay on tenants’ records and how often landlords can use that against them, said Ellen Sahli, president of the Family Housing Fund, an organization focused on housing access and affordability in the Twin Cities.

While state law allows residents to pursue eviction expungements, tenant advocates say that process can be costly and time-consuming for low-income households, forcing them to forgo it altogether. Sahli said that’s why it’s important for landlords and tenants in financial distress to know in advance that assistance exists and agencies are there to make sure that help is readily available.

“Our goal is to eliminate eviction filings, which means we have to have the services and support in place before so that the family gets the kind of help they need to avert the filing completely,” Sahli said.

Luke Grundman, a managing attorney for housing issues at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, said that his public-housing clients are often confused by the housing agency’s letters or unclear about where to go for help. The organization talked to the housing authority about changing the wording of the letters, sending texts and reaching out to emergency contacts to communicate with residents.

“Many times people who are in housing court facing a [Minneapolis Housing Authority] eviction are genuinely surprised,” Grundman said. “They didn’t even realize it was happening. They didn’t realize they were at the stage where they could be homeless in a matter of days.”

The housing authority says residents are given plenty of notice before action is taken. It does not file an eviction against residents until the second month after they’re late and even then always offers a settlement during the court appearance. Residents are sent two letters before an eviction is filed. While residents may reach a settlement with the agency, they’ll also be responsible for paying back the $297 eviction filing fee. The agency allows residents to pay the fee over three months.

Residents’ monthly statements include numbers to call for rent assistance and information about talking to property managers about hardships, said Mary McGovern, a tenant at the Elliot Twins apartments and president of the Minneapolis High Rise Representative Council, which advocates for the 5,000-plus tenants living in the housing authority’s high-rise apartments.

“It’s not like 1, 2, 3 and you’re out the door; they don’t work that way,” McGovern said.

She said tenants “would be lost” without the social workers from Volunteers of America who help residents with family problems, money issues, food assistance, clothing and paying their utilities.

“A lot of people struggle to afford housing and they manage to pay the rent, but we’re talking about incomes that are so low … you have to wonder whether they can even afford that rent,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president of research for the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Looking for solutions

The housing authority’s Scott said the agency formed an internal task force on eviction preventions to find solutions. The agency realized that tenants receiving benefits checks were not always getting them at the beginning or end of the month, often causing them to be late on rent.

In addition, the agency worked with the Hennepin County emergency-assistance fund so that tenants could apply for help using their initial notice of late rent instead of having to wait for an eviction notice for their application.

The housing authority also conducted a survey this spring of 150 residents. It found that 75% said they had a late rent payment, with the top reasons including the due date, medical problems, family problems, lack of income and that they forgot. The survey also found that less than half of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they “know where to get help with rent.”

“I think we’re getting better at working through the needs of residents, working with policy issues, working with partners at the county to facilitate residents keeping their housing,” Scott said. “We’re on that path and we’ll continue to refine it as best as we can.”"

BEDMINSTER, N.J. – President Donald Trump's acting secretary of Homeland Security expressed regret Sunday for the timing of immigration raids that netted 680 workers at food processing plants in Mississippi, an operation that took place after a mass shooting that targeted Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.

""The timing was unfortunate,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

McAleenan said the long-planned raid received court approval before the operation that led to the arrests of 680 people, the majority of them Hispanic.

""That means those employers are just ignoring the law entirely in what they do,"" McAleenan said. ""That's why a judge gave us a warrant to go after them.""

McAleenan said the administration is aware that Hispanics feel targeted in the wake of the mass shooting Aug. 3 in El Paso that claimed at least 22 lives, days before the raids in Mississippi.

The Department of Homeland Security regards the El Paso shooting as an attack ""on our community"" at the U.S.-Mexican border and is working to address the threat of ""domestic terrorism,"" McAleenan told NBC News.

Asked whether authorities considered delaying the raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, McAleenan said, ""Something like this has been planned for over a year. This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issued by a judge, and ICE had to follow through on that. It was already planned and in motion.”

Only employees were arrested at the plants – not employers.

Officials said Thursday that 300 people arrested during the raids were released.

""We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation,"" McAleenan said. ""You get a warrant from a federal judge with probable cause. You then go gather evidence at the sites. And then you look at the appropriate charges in concert with the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney to see how you proceed.""

Congressional Democrats said they are looking into events that led up to the raids in Mississippi.

In a letter to Matthew Albence, acting director of ICE, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., lamented that the raids stranded children of the workers who were arrested.

""At a time when this country is grieving due to two domestic terrorist shootings, your agency has instead seemingly deliberately disregarded its own long-standing guidelines and carried out another form of family separation,"" Thompson said.

After the attack in El Paso, another mass shooting that weekend in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.

""The blatant lack of planning and resulting chaos calls into question the true motivation behind these worksite enforcement operations,"" Thompson said.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, defended the operation on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""We still have to apply consequences, meaning enforce the rule of law, for those individuals that are here illegally against immigration law,"" he said.

Harris decries 'campaign of terror' against immigrants,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Jerry Adler', 'Yahoo News']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/11/harris-decries-campaign-of-terror-against-immigrants/23791445/,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Sunday that President Trump’s administration is running a “campaign of terror” against immigrants.

Harris made the comment on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where moderator Chuck Todd asked her about last week’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Mississippi.

According to CNN, 680 undocumented workers were arrested in seven poultry-processing plants in Mississippi. Hundreds of children were stranded at school and taken to neighbors’ homes or makeshift shelters, and video of an 11-year-old girl crying for her parents went viral.

By the next day about half of those arrested had been released and given future court dates. No officials of the plants were arrested.

Another guest on “Meet the Press” was Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who told Todd that the timing of the raids, a few days after a terror attack directed at Hispanics took 22 lives in El Paso, Texas, “was unfortunate.”

“I don’t know why they did what they did,” Harris said. “I don’t know why they decided to do it right after El Paso. The employers have to be responsible and they have to do whatever is required by law. But there’s another point here, Chuck, which is this administration has directed DHS to conduct these raids as part of what I believe is this administration’s campaign of terror — which is to make whole populations of people afraid to go to work. Children are afraid to go to school for fear that when they come home, their parents won’t be there.”

“Can [Trump] say, can he say anything, at this point, to reassure Hispanic Americans?” Todd asked.

“I don't think it would be authentic if he did. And I think people are smart enough to know that,” Harris responded.

In the wide-ranging interview, which touched on health care, foreign policy, gun control and counter-intelligence, Harris, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said “Russia exposed America’s Achilles heel” in the 2016 election: racism.

“They tried out a bunch of different things” to interfere with and influence the election, Harris said. “And you know what caught heat? The issue of race. So Russia exposed America's Achilles’ heel. And all of a sudden then, guess what? For those who want to marginalize the conversation about race and racial inequities and say, ‘Oh, well, that's identity politics or that's this or that's that.’

“Guess what? Now it is also a national security issue. And we need to deal with it.”

Pressed by Todd on whether “in hindsight” the ICE raid should have been postponed, McAleenan stressed that “it was already planned and in motion” by the time the El Paso attack occurred. “Something like this has been planned for over a year,” he said. “This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issued by a judge, and ICE had to follow through on that.”

“Did you know this raid was going to happen this week in advance? Were you informed of this? Was the president informed of this?” Todd asked.

McAleenan said he knew of the raid in advance but didn’t directly answer the question about Trump’s knowledge saying, “So, the president doesn’t run law enforcement operations.”

Asked why there were no charges against the companies that employed the undocumented workers, or executives of those companies, McAleenan said, “We’re in the middle of an ongoing investigation.

“You get a warrant from a federal judge with probable cause. You then go gather evidence at the sites. And then you look at the appropriate charges in concert with the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney to see how you proceed.”

Trump wants Israel to block Omar and Tlaib from visiting: Report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-wants-israel-to-block-omar-and-tlaib-from-visiting-report,"President Trump reportedly wants Israel to bar Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering the country.

Trump told senior White House advisers he hopes Israel uses its anti-boycott law to block the freshmen Democrats from touring the country, according to Axios. The law, passed by Israel’s Parliament in 2017, allows the country to refuse entry to anybody who supports boycotts against Israel.

The White House has denied that Trump made any such statement.

""The Israeli government can do what they want. It's fake news,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Saturday.

Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, are expected to travel to Israel on Aug. 18 to learn more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Both are supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement to isolate Israel, which the House voted 398-to-17 to condemn on July 23. Omar and Tlaib voted against the resolution.

Trump has feuded with Omar and Tlaib in recent months, targeting them and their fellow freshmen lawmakers Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.

On July 14, Trump tweeted that the four lawmakers should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Democrats and some Republicans criticized the tweets as racist, and 235 House Democrats and 4 Republicans voted to condemn the president’s remarks."
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""
Trump administration mulls decertifying immigration judges' union,https://thehill.com,[],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/456991-trump-admin-looking-to-possibly-decertify-immigration-judges-union,"The Trump administration has reportedly taken a step to decertify an immigration judges’ union that has been repeatedly critical of President Trump Donald John TrumpScalise: Trump no more responsible for El Paso than 'Bernie Sanders is for my shooting' Bloomberg: Next generation of Democrats needs to 'earn their spurs' Bloomberg: McConnell may allow gun reform vote to boost reelection chances MORE and the White House’s policy proposals.

A Department of Justice (DOJ) spokesperson told The New York Times on Friday that the department filed a petition to the Federal Labor Relations Authority asking whether the National Association of Immigration Judges could have its certification revoked since its members are “management officials” and unable to collectively organize.

Members of the union have denounced the move as misguided and as an attempt to dismantle the group.

“This is a misguided effort to minimize our impact,” Judge Amiena Khan, vice president of the judges’ union, told the Times. “We serve as a check and balance on management prerogatives and that’s why they are doing this to us.""

Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the union’s president, told The Washington Post that she thinks the petition is an attempt to “disband and destroy the union.""

Immigration judges are unique in that, unlike federal judges, they are appointed by the attorney general and considered employees of the DOJ, the Times noted. Representatives of the immigration judges' union are permitted to publicly speak about DOJ policies that are deemed political. Sitting judges are prohibited from doing so.

Khan and Tabaddor have continued to publicly criticize the Trump administration's policies throughout the president's two-plus years in the White House. For example, the union in 2018 condemned an administration quota system that required judges to complete 700 cases annually.

The judges' union had reportedly said that the system hindered due process rights for immigrants in court. Tabbador had said at the time that the pressure to take on more cases was like “psychological warfare.""

BuzzFeed News reported earlier this year that some immigration judges were leaving their positions because of changes to the court, as well as an increasing backlog driven by the administration's policies. The Justice Department has moved to help with the backlog, which is reportedly more than 830,000 cases.

But the union has still been critical of those efforts.

“I can’t work alone, I am reliant on support staff,” said Khan. “Right now there are two judges to one support staff person,” which has delayed the progress of cases despite the additional judges, she said.

The union is planning to officially respond to the petition once it receives a notice from the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The petition will likely lead to an investigation from the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a DOJ spokesperson told the Times."
Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong 'have gone from irresponsible to dangerous': State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Brunnstrom', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/chinese-reports-on-u-s-diplomat-in-hong-kong-have-gone-from-irresponsible-to-dangerous-state-department-idUSKCN1UZ2HK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement “have gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.

“Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,” Ortagus added in a tweet.

She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: “This must stop.”

On Thursday, Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate’s political section.

“I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children — I don’t think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,” she told a briefing.

The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.

The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.

The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline “Foreign Forces Intervene”.

The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children’s details were disclosed.

In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said “foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”

“China has a long record of broken commitments; it’s their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,” she said.

China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon."
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."
The administration said it was moving these agencies for efficiency. Now the truth comes out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'August At Pm']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-administration-said-it-was-moving-these-agencies-for-efficiency-now-the-truth-comes-out/2019/08/10/854ccd10-b91a-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html,"“WHAT A wonderful way to streamline government,” said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at a gala last week, referring to the Agriculture Department’s plan to move two of its science agencies out of the D.C. area to the Kansas City region. In celebrating this controversial decision, Mr. Mulvaney laid bare the thinly veiled motivations behind uprooting researchers: not efficiency, but to drive talented workers out.

Since the relocation announcement in June, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has defended the controversial proposal, arguing that relocation will bring researchers closer to the subjects of their research and save the agency millions in employment costs and rent. But the haste and amateurishness of the process raised suspicions about true motives. And, now, Mr. Mulvaney has confirmed those suspicions by celebrating the gutting of the Economic Research Service, a federal statistics agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees grant money for agricultural research. The motivation fits with the administration’s broader hostility toward experts, science and honest data.

In June, a Politico analysis found that the Trump administration barred dozens of climate-change-related investigations from being publicized. Politico also discovered that the research service issued news releases on only two studies directly related to climate change — both of which were favorable to the meat industry.

Even if relocation were justifiable, the USDA’s handling of the process has, so far, been deplorable. The more than 500 agency employees affected by the move were given 33 days to decide between their career and the lives they had established in the District. Approximately two-thirds chose resignation over reassignment. The loss of talent and institutional knowledge creates an irreparable tear in the fabric of the agency — and an entirely foreseeable one. If the USDA’s plan was to “drain the swamp,” as Mr. Mulvaney put it, then it certainly is succeeding — if by swamp, as Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, they mean civil service expertise. But if the department wants to carry out its true mission of helping rural America, it should rethink this move.

Research by the USDA is vital to farmers. As economic challenges mount with the ongoing trade war with China, and as climate change poses a growing threat to farmlands worldwide, the work by the ERS and NIFA is indispensable. They not only help farmers improve efficiency and productivity but also help smooth access to international markets.

The relocation is not a done deal. The USDA’s watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, published a report this month that challenges the relocation, which is meant to be completed by Sept. 30. By acting without budgetary approval from Congress, the USDA may have violated the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Rather than waiting for a judicial rebuke, the department should cancel the relocation now."
"Gillibrand pledges to direct Justice Department to ""infiltrate"" white supremacist groups",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kirsten-gillibrand-on-face-the-nation-pledges-to-instruct-justice-department-to-infiltrate-white-supremacist-groups/,"In the wake of the anti-immigrant and anti-Latino massacre in El Paso last week, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of seven Democratic senators running for president, vowed to carry out a concerted crackdown on white supremacist groups if elected, saying she would order federal investigators to penetrate racist organizations and thwart potential violent attacks.

""As president I would direct my Department of Justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups,"" Gillibrand said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""To infiltrate them, to make sure we know if they're planning attacks and to actually combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists.""

The New York Democrat said domestic terrorism should be a federal crime and expressed support for a bill spearheaded by her colleague Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois that would bolster the government's efforts to combat domestic terrorist movements.

According to court documents unsealed Friday, the 21-year-old white man suspected of killing 22 people inside a Walmart in El Paso last Saturday admitted to police that he targeted Mexicans. A manifesto he purportedly authored that federal investigators are scrutinizing denounces the growing Latino community in Texas as an ""invasion.""

Like other high-profile Democrats, Gillibrand drew a direct link between President Trump's rhetoric on immigration and the apparent motives of the gunman.

""His words have consequences, and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country,"" she said Sunday.

Asked if singling out the president for his rhetoric in the aftermath of two mass shootings might ratchet up tensions in the country, Gillibrand said Mr. Trump is the one making matters worse.

""He is not leading us in the right direction,"" she said. ""He has used words like 'infestation.' He's used words like 'invasion.' That is creating a climate where people are literally today fueled by anger and hate. They are hunting down other people using weapons of war. That's what we're up against right now."""
State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
EPA defies California rules over Monsanto Roundup,https://www.upi.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/08/10/EPA-defies-California-rules-over-Monsanto-Roundup/4571565463730/,"The Environmental Protection Agency told companies Thursday they would not approve labels which abide by California requirements to warn customers that glyphosate in Monsanto Roundup has been linked to cancer. File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License Photo

Aug. 10 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has defied California regulators by no longer approving labels claiming Monsanto Roundup is known to cause cancer.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has listed glyphosate, a chemical compound-base for Monsanto Roundup herbicide weed killer, as causing cancer since July 2017. Furthermore, glyphosate was added to the state's Proposition 65 list, which requires businesses to warn customers about chemicals known to cause cancer.

The EPA defied that regulation Thursday by saying it will no longer approve product labels claiming glyphosate is known to cause cancer.

""It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not post a cancer risk,"" the EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them. EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

The EPA added that California's listing of glyphosate on the state's Proposition 65 list is based on the International Agency on the Research for Cancer classifying it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" However, EPA's independent evaluation found that glyphosate is ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the agency said that its data set was ""more extensive and relevant.""

The EPA action rejects the idea that the weed killer is likely to pose a cancer risk despite rulings against Bayer-owned Monsanto in California earlier this year resulting in tens of millions of dollars in awards to sick clients, and amid the the world's best-selling herbicide facing more than 13,000 suits nationwide.

Among the rulings so far, was a $2 billion award to a couple diagnosed with cancer after using Roundup for decades, which was later cut down to $86.7 million in a subsequent ruling. Another case involved an $80 million award to a California man whose cancer the jury found was likely linked to the herbicide.

California jurors also awarded $289 million to a man last year who testified that two years after he was soaked with the product in an accident as a groundskeeper for a school district near San Francisco, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite wearing protective clothing and face mask."
ICE raids leave community shattered,https://www.koaa.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.koaa.com/news/national-world-news/ice-raids-leave-community-shattered,"(NBC News) President Trump is defending this week's immigration raids in Mississippi, calling them a ""deterrent"" to migrants thinking about entering the country illegally.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 680 people Wednesday, suspected of being undocumented immigrants, at seven Mississippi food processing plants.

It's the largest immigration raid ever in one state.

""I want people to know, that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent,"" President Trump said.

The Trump administration and ICE are drawing criticism for apparently not having a plan to take care of children left without parents at home after the raids.

One ICE official told NBC News ""We are a law enforcement agency, not a social services agency.""

Churches, schools and concerned community members have stepped in to help.

Federal prosecutors will not say whether the owners or managers of the Mississippi food processing plants will be charged or fined for employing undocumented immigrants.

Roughly 270 of those arrested in the raids have been released after they were given court dates. The rest are being held in federal facilities in Mississippi and Louisiana.

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining. I don't get hung up on injuries, but what they exactly expect from us triple amputees, single amputees, paras ... I don't, I can't really comprehend that."""
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

Advertisement:

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have been briefed by the State Department on the case of Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer in the department's Bureau of Energy Resources, after he was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch initiative on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. One of the sources said the committee was learning about the facts of the situation and why he had been placed on leave.

In an extensive report released Wednesday, Hatewatch alleged that Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, Gebert used a pseudonym to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,"" Gebert, speaking as ""Coach Finstock,"" reportedly said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. Hatewatch claims it has matched Gebert to the pseudonyms he used online.

The report said that in August 2017, on that same podcast, ""Coach Finstock"" said he was prepared to lose his career for the cause of white nationalism.

USDA eases relocation timeline as researchers flee agency,https://thehill.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456921-usda-eases-relocation-timeline-as-researchers-flee-agency,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reversed course late Friday, agreeing to key union demands as nearly two-thirds of its research staff will leave the agency rather than move to new headquarters in the Kansas City area.

The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks at the USDA where employees were given a month to decide if they would uproot from D.C. by Sept. 30 or lose their jobs that same day.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) — two of the major research wings within USDA — unionized in the wake of the agency’s relocation plans and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

The Friday contract will allow employees who agreed to relocate to telework through the end of the year, including the option to extend the time period.

Employees who make the move will also be given a bonus equal to one month’s pay “to help compensate for the loss of income incurred by employees moving from the higher wage D.C. area,” according to a press release from the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA employees.

Two-thirds of the staff at the two agencies told USDA they would forfeit their job rather than move to Kansas City in a plan many say is politically motivated and poorly organized.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill when the move was first announced.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

Democrats have repeatedly questioned the wisdom of the move.

Those outside of political circles have also questioned the planned relocation and whether it’s entirely legal. A Tuesday report from USDA’s Office of Inspector General said the decision may have violated the law.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.

"Anti-sex trafficking leader praises ICE, Trump: 'No question' he's done more than previous presidents",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-trafficking-leader-praises-ice-trump,"Director and activist Jaco Booyens touted President Trump's historic work in fighting sex trafficking and defended Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as ""incredible people"" who helped keep children safe.

Fox News host Mark Levin asked Booyens whether Trump did more to address the issue than other presidents, including former President Barack Obama. ""No question,"" Booyens responded on ""Life, Liberty, and Levin,"" airing Sunday.

Booyens said that despite all the criticism surrounding ICE, the agency has become a vital partner in combatting sex trafficking.

""These are incredible men and women that help us ... incredible people who actually go and keep America's children safe. This president has empowered them to do so,"" he told Levin.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN AMERICA AMONG WORST IN WORLD: REPORT

His movie ""8 Days"" tells the story of a 15-year-old girl who's forced into sex trafficking after attending a party with her friends. Booyens said the film is available on Netflix and other places.

Booyens claimed that he tried taking his story to CNN and MSNBC but faced ""closed doors."" ""I say that not to point finger or blame, that's just a fact. This crime doesn't ask 'are you conservative or liberal?'""

Levin asked Booyens whether CNN and MSNBC were too focused on their own ""ideological agenda"" to cover the issue. ""You want to believe they're too busy to pay attention and yes they are because they're busy with silly stuff -- accusing the president,"" Booyens responded.

He also argued that sex trafficking was rooted in sex addiction fueled by mass media. ""It is sex addiction that in its core is fueled ... it starts with a pornographic culture, soft porn, it's the objectification of women -- which we as a country have done a great job at completely objectifying women."" Specifically, Booyens said, Hollywood was to blame along with the Internet."
Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."

The department filed a petition asking the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority to examine whether it should revoke the certification of the National Association of Immigration Judges because, a Justice Department spokesman said, its members are “management officials” under the law.

Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the association’s president, said she thinks the petition’s intent is to “disband and destroy the union,” which has publicly pushed for judges to have more independence and sparred with the Justice Department over a quota system it imposed.

“It’s designed to take full control of judges without having a balancing force or a balancing voice,” Tabaddor said.

Immigration judges, who decide deportation and other-immigration related cases, are somewhat unusual in that they are not part of the judicial branch; rather, they are Justice Department employees. Like other Justice Department employees, they are generally prohibited from talking publicly — except that their union can advocate for them.

Tabaddor, for example, was skeptical last year of the administration’s effort to pressure judges to process cases faster by implementing a quota system tied to their performance reviews, saying the directive “could call into question the integrity and impartiality of the court if a judge’s decision is influenced by factors outside the facts of the case.” The union has also advocated for judges to be independent of the attorney general.

Tabaddor disputed that immigration judges could be considered management and thus not eligible to unionize.

“We don’t even have the authority to order the procurement of pencils,” she said.

The Justice Department’s filing will spark the opening of a case, and attorneys with the Federal Labor Relations Authority will probably then conduct an investigation, a Justice Department spokesman said, and the timing of the process varies significantly from case to case."

All Eyes on the Aug. 12 USDA Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/all-eyes-aug-12-usda-reports,"The countdown is on. On Monday, Aug. 12, USDA will release its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). This year’s August reports will include more information than ever before, including the resurvey announced in June, satellite data and, for the first time ever, FSA acreage certification information.

This report has the potential to be a market mover and hold several surprises, market analysts say.

“There is no question that the upcoming reports are critical as they should technically set the baseline for production that should have been set six weeks ago, and as such, holds the potential to generate quite a bit of excitement either higher or lower next week,” says Dan Hueber, general manager of The Hueber Report.

Hueber has one big prediction for Monday: “We will experience 30 seconds to a minute of market insanity when the figures are released.”

“Of course, there is a lot of talk about this report,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “A lot of people think the USDA will provide us with more clarity in regard to the production situation for corn and soybeans.”

Vaclavik says USDA should provide some certainty around the acreage situation, based on the extensive resurvey it did in July. But yields remain a huge question market.

“I think will continue to be debated through harvest,” he adds. “In any year, it is difficult to predict yields in August. This year, the crop is very late, and maturity is lagging, along with enormous variability.”

Heading into the report, analysts expect a decline in planted and harvested corn acres and a rise in soybean acres, reports Kevin McNew, chief economist at Farmer's Business Network. That’s based on the Reuters pre-survey poll of analysts.

For corn, the average estimate for planted acres is 88 million acres. That’s 3.1 million acres lower than the July WASDE. Harvested acres are pegged at 80 million acres, which is 3.4 million acres lower than the July estimates.

Corn yields are predicted to be 164.9 bu. per acre, which is down 1.1 bu. from July.

For soybeans, the average estimate for planted acres is 81 million acres, which is up 1 million acres from the July WASDE. Harvested acres are predicted to be 79.9 million acres, which is up around 0.6 million acres form July.

Soybean yields are predicted to be 47.6 bu. per acre, which is down 0.9 bu. from July.

“At FBN, we believe that the range of estimates for corn planted, harvested acres and the yield number was large,” McNew adds. “We believe that given the range of estimates for 2019/20 corn production the August WASDE can contain surprises. For soybeans the range of production related estimates was much narrower suggesting that a general directional consensus on the direction of the 2019/20 crop.”

State Department employee linked to white supremacy placed on leave,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-employee-linked-to-white-supremacy-placed-on-leave-report,"A State Department official is reportedly on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The SPLC published a report on Wednesday alleging Bureau of Energy Resources foreign affairs officer Matthew Gebert uses the alias ""Coach Finstock"" to advocate for white supremacy and white nationalism on social media and other places.

The State Department has placed Gebert on leave while it investigates the allegations made in the SPLC report, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.

""[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,"" a man identified as Coach Finstock said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. ""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.""

Gebert held white nationalist parties at his Virginia home, according to the SPLC. The left-wing civil rights group deduced that Gebert operates under the pseudonym ""Coach Finstock"" through a review of the Coach Finstock handle’s history on social media.

The SPLC has made false accusations of bigotry and radicalism in the past. In 2018, the SPLC publicly apologized to Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamic radical the group included in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists."" The SPLC also paid Nawaz a $3.375 million settlement."

PETERSBURG — The St. Petersburg Housing Authority is hiring an outside investigator to look into employee reports of a hostile work environment ""orchestrated"" by agency CEO Tony Love.

The complaints from a majority of staffers at every level emerged during a review of the troubled agency conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Even though the review is ongoing, HUD officials felt it necessary to warn the Housing Authority's governing board that the treatment of staffers is putting the agency at significant legal risk.

""A topic that was consistent from the majority of the staff at every level was 'hostile work environment,' "" Elis Wilson-Henri, HUD public housing regional director for the southeast, wrote in an email to Housing Authority board members.

He has ordered the board to respond with a proposed plan to investigate and deal with the allegations.

Board Chairwoman Stephanie Owens said the housing authority has contracted with law firm Saxon Gilmore to hire an outside investigator. Its senior partner, Ricardo Gilmore, already serves as special counsel to several housing authorities, including Tampa's.

""We’re very concerned,"" Owens said. ""We take those types of allegations very seriously and recognize the importance of taking immediate action and that’s what we’ve done.""

The investigation could be another setback for Love, who has faced criticism after a series of missteps including charging a board member for public records and a Tampa Bay Times investigation that revealed he lived rent-free for nine months in an apartment designated for low-income families.

It also may detract from his recent success in winning coveted tax credits from the state to help refinance the redevelopment of Jordan Park. The credits were awarded last week by the Florida Housing Finance Corp. They can be sold to companies to raise funds for the public housing project's redevelopment.

Housing Authority spokesman Michelle Ligon said neither Love nor the agency would comment until the HUD review is complete.

Complaints about Love's management style, particularly of female employees, has emerged as a problem before.

In 2016, at least two senior staff complained about his treatment of women in anonymous questionnaires they were asked to fill out as part of Love's first evaluation as CEO.

That prompted board members to insist that Love work with Massachusetts housing consultant Leo Dauwer on his people skills, for which Dauwer's firm was paid $3,600.

In a five-hour meeting with the consultant, Love acknowledged he “screamed’’ at staffers and on one occasion made them do non-agency work for him.

But complaints have continued this year. In February, one was filed with human resources by Robin Adams, the authority's asset management officer. She reported needing counseling to deal with the “extreme stress” and anxiety caused by Love, who is paid $157,000 annually to run the agency.

“Mr. Love has consistently verbally abused, harassed and degraded me and other senior staff members, especially female staff members, through one-way interrogations, baseless chastising, insults and bullying,” she wrote. Some six months after the complaint was filed, it was still pending.

HUD decided to conduct a review of the Housing Authority after it used agency funds to sue Mayor Rick Kriseman and the City of St. Petersburg when council members voted to remove three board members for lax oversight. The board members removed from office were staunch allies of Love.

The agency's lawsuit argued that charges of misconduct and neglect of duty cited to justify removal were a ""pretext"" so Kriseman can appoint commissioners who will fire Love.

A judge dismissed the lawsuit, leaving the Housing Authority with at least $27,000 in legal fees.

Wilson-Henri, the HUD official, also told board members in his email that its review has raised some concerns about the Housing Authority's spending. It did not provide any examples.

Still, board members voted at a special meeting earlier this week to lower the threshold for agency spending without prior board approval from $150,000 to $20,000.

""This gives the board closer and more tight checks and balances,"" Owens said.

Trump Criticized DOD’s Potential Cloud Deal With Amazon. Now The Program Is On Hold,https://dailycaller.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/07/trump-amazon-dod/,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is under fire as lawmakers are questioning why Amazon’s cloud technology was unable to detect the Capital One hack.

The company is being scrutinized after President Donald Trump’s criticisms prompted the DOD to put a hold on a program giving Amazon the ability to build out the agency’s cloud technology.

DOD’s decision to place a hold on the $10 billion program also comes as critics of Amazon’s role in the project manage to impress upon Trump how deeply Bezos was involved.

President Donald Trump’s growing skepticism of a potential Department of Defense cloud computing program with Amazon comes as CEO Jeff Bezos fields questions about why his company’s technology was unable to prevent the Capital One hack.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper is now reviewing accusations of unfairness in the contract process for the program, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), the Pentagon announced on Aug. 1. His decision came after Trump ratcheted up criticism of the project. Amazon and Microsoft are the only two finalists.

Amazon, which is expected to land the program, is now wrestling with questions from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, who wants to know why the company’s cloud computing technology was unable to prevent Capital One hack. The company stored the 106 million Capital One credit-card records an accused hacker allegedly stole.

Capital One blamed the incident on “a specific configuration vulnerability” in the way it uses Amazon’s cloud. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday how the accused hacker was allegedly able to exploit a weakness in some misconfigured networks that cloud security experts frequently warn about. Amazon has not replied to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Conservatives and other experts warn that relying on one cloud system creates severe security risks.

“The use of multiple cloud solutions follows industry-wide best practices utilized by most Fortune 500 companies. Mr. [Trey] Hodgkins [of IT Alliance for Public Sector] noted that by using multiple providers, the cybersecurity and functionality of the JEDI system would be improved, costs would decrease through increased competition,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget.

Esper’s review is expected to delay awarding the JEDI contract, which would give the Pentagon a single cloud computing system for data ranging from personnel statistics to intelligence information rather than the hundreds the military currently uses. (RELATED: Trump Says He’s Getting A Lot Of Complaints About DOD’s $10 Billion Cloud Project)

Controversy has plagued the cloud computing program. Computing giant Oracle, for instance, alleged in a May 31 complaint that former DOD official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out JEDI. Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document.

Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle noted in its document, referring to Amazon Web Services, the arm responsible for implementing the system.

Other reports revealed similar problems. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attended a 2017 event with Teresa Carlson, vice president of Amazon’s worldwide public sector services. The dinner ultimately helped forge another meeting in August 2017 between Mattis and Bezos, The Wall Street Journal reported in July, citing emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

White House officials recently showed Trump a document that connects Ubhi and others to a ploy awarding Amazon the 10-year contract, CNN reported in July, citing documents. The document is identical to one from Oracle lobbyist Kenneth Glueck, an executive vice president with the company. The DCNF has independently confirmed the existence of the flow charts.

Trump has gotten more public in his criticisms. “So I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” the president said during a July interview. He was referring to complaints conservative have made recently about a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract. The president also retweeted a Fox News segment on July 22 criticizing the JEDI contract as “The Bezos Bailout.”

White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

"USDA acreage debate pushes U.S. farmers, grain traders on data hunt",https://finance.yahoo.com,['Barbara Smith'],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/usda-acreage-debate-pushes-u-114112186.html,"By Barbara Smith

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As severe weather ravaged the U.S. Midwest this spring, agricultural software company Sentera was swamped with frustrated farmers and traders uploading drone videos of waterlogged crop fields.

Farmers wanted the Minneapolis-based data company to help analyze how much acreage could still be planted, and spot damaged fields after floods kept farming states underwater for weeks.

The U.S. agricultural industry depends on estimates of how much acreage of soy, corn and other products have been planted. A major source is the benchmark survey of about 80,000 farmers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

In June, the USDA acreage report's projections far exceeded industry supply estimates, causing panic in the grain market. Corn futures fell 4%, the steepest one-day decline in nearly three years. The American Farm Bureau claimed the report triggered a nearly $2.6 billion drop in the value of new-crop corn.

Traders and analysts said the data failed to reflect the effect of massive floods and heavy rains on planting, prompting farmers and agricultural analysts to seek out technology companies that use sourced data like drone videos and satellite imagery to analyze conditions.

""That USDA report was an absolute joke,"" said Brad Freking, owner of New Fashion Pork, which produces 1.4 million market hogs a year across seven U.S. states. ""It created huge confusion.""

Sentera said the total volume of farm-field drone data processed so far this year has risen more than 12 times over the year-ago period, and volume is up more than 30 times in areas hard hit by floods and heavy rain, including Nebraska and Indiana.

""It's been the year of uncertainty, and everyone - farmers, the market - is looking for data,"" said Sentera Chief Executive Eric Taipale.

Farmers also flocked to Boston-based satellite imaging company Indigo Ag this summer, causing a 133% jump in downloads of its June crop acreage forecast report versus a year earlier, the company said in an email.

The U.S. farm belt is awaiting the next USDA data dump on Monday, which may provide a fresh acreage estimates after USDA resurveyed producers in 14 states.

Farmers are still angry about the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) June figures, putting USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue on the defensive about it this week at a Minnesota fair.

""This is not the first time I hear farmers say what NASS has found is wrong,"" Perdue said. ""Facts are facts, data is data and it's done consistently.""

""There are limitations to (USDA's) system,"" said Carly Beneke, applied scientist with Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Descartes Labs, a satellite mapping company also used by farmers. ""You can't ask every single farmer across the country to provide information, and then turn all that data into something useful frequently.""

It is unclear just how many farmers are using drones for land surveys, but those interviewed by Reuters said they were trying to guard against surprises.

Iowa farmer Noah Coppess, 38, used his drones this year to help neighbors get a better picture of stressed crops. Fellow Iowan Michael Jackson has been shopping for a new infrared camera lens for his drone to better spot problems on his corn and soybean fields.

""It's just the direction we're heading in modern times,"" Jackson said.

The State Department has put on leave an employee of its energy bureau after reports that he has been an active member of a white supremacist group for more than five years, two sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer for the department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, was linked to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of a white supremacist organization and published racist propaganda online, according to a report published Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech.

Story Continued Below

In a May 2018 episode of a white nationalist podcast, Gebert, speaking under a pseudonym, called for white people to establish “a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” according to the SPLC report.

“We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,” the report quoted him saying.

Attempts to contact Gebert were unsuccessful. Twitter accounts that SPLC described in its report as belonging to Gebert and that have posted anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages were deleted as of Wednesday afternoon.

A State Department spokesperson did not reply to questions about Gebert‘s employment status.

“The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace,” a department spokesperson said.

Gebert started working at the bureau as a career employee in 2013, according to a posting in the George Washington alumni magazine the SPLC cited. He worked on energy issues involving Pakistan and India during his time there, former co-workers told POLITICO.

Former State Department officials expressed surprise that security screenings had not flagged Gebert’s involvement with the hate groups. Gebert would have undergone a routine screening before starting his position and another at his five-year work anniversary, said Amos Hochstein, who served as special envoy and coordinator for the State Department’s international energy affairs from 2014 to 2017 and was Gebert’s boss.

“It is inconceivable he got security clearance twice,” Hochstein told POLITICO. “If Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught. Neo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I'm horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.“

A State Department spokesman did not respond to questions about the department’s security clearance practices.

The system needs an overhaul.

The recent Democratic debates covered a range of topics, from the economy to foreign policy to Trump-is-a-racist to “dark psychic forces.” In the midst of the onslaught of hyperbolic rhetoric, only one candidate spoke about the military: Representative Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii. She was the only one talking about veterans and active-duty service members in a sincere, meaningful way. She’s also one of the main sponsors of legislation that will finally begin to address an issue that is extremely personal to me: the myriad lung conditions caused by exposure to open burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In March of 2007, I returned home from a six-and-a-half-month deployment at Camp Fallujah, Iraq, as an extremely fit 35-year-old Marine captain. Within a month I started coughing and developed pneumonia, which was a first for me. Once I recovered, after nearly a month, I was still coughing, and I knew something was wrong. Over the next two and a half years, in addition to suffering chronic sinus infections and bronchitis, I underwent a complete battery of pulmonary-function tests, blood work, and exams, until finally a VA pulmonologist determined that I had suffered permanent damage to the small airways in my lungs. He called it the “chronic bronchitis type of COPD” and said it was likely a result of whatever I was exposed to in Iraq. It was irreversible but manageable. I separated from the Marine Corps in 2009 and made the rookie mistake of assuming that my lung condition was included in my disability rating from the VA. It was not.

Two years ago, the issue of burn pits — used at camps and bases to dispose of anything and everything, including wood, plastics, etc. — hit my radar. I researched it, and the more I learned, the more I became convinced that the burn pit at Camp Fallujah was the source of my problems, as I’d been completely healthy before my deployment. I reached out to the VA and was told to register for the VA’s Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, which as of this writing has 182,282 participants. I then discovered that my lung condition, the most serious disability I have, was not covered adequately, and I filed a supplemental claim with the VA. What followed was a 15-month-long battle that I chronicled in a series of columns. (I strongly recommend you read all three, especially part 3, which outlines how veterans can get their conditions covered and the specific criteria they need to meet.)

This is an issue that doesn’t get nearly the attention or the hard work in Congress that it deserves. There are countless veterans out there right now suffering in silence, possibly dying (some already have) or having their claims denied by the VA. Once denied, they have nowhere else to go or turn to for additional help, and they just give up.

Representative Gabbard has taken a first step with the Burn Pits Accountability Act (BPAA). I was informed by her office that the BPAA was passed as part of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel’s mark-up of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate then included it as an amendment in the committee version of its bill. Before this becomes too much like an episode of Schoolhouse Rock, here is where it stands: The differences between the two bills will have to be resolved in a cross-chamber conference committee, but since the BPAA is in both, it should remain intact and become law.

But here’s the real problem: All the BPAA does is “require the Department of Defense to evaluate and track the exposure of U.S. service members and veterans to open burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.” It does not guarantee coverage or simplify the VA’s nightmarish, convoluted, byzantine claims process.

When I was going through my exasperating battle with the VA, I was informed that the diagnostic code that the VA uses was written in 1945. An official at the VA told me, “If you want to really help, try to get Congress to rewrite the code to make our jobs easier.” The people at the VA want to help, but their hands are tied by bureaucratic red tape, and that tape has the very real effect of denying claims to service members who deserve coverage as well as better treatment. If Congress really wants to help, it should force the VA to expedite a revision of the diagnostic code, a revision that was begun piecemeal in 2009. At this pace, veterans who are suffering and dying will obtain disability coverage by the year 2100.

Since I started bringing attention to this issue, I’ve had countless veterans and active-duty service members reach out to me and share their stories of frustration, anger, and sadness, a sadness instilled by a feeling of abandonment by the same government they enthusiastically served. It is infuriating when I hear stories of healthy men and women who suddenly contracted illnesses — in some cases, cancer — for which they had no preexisting symptoms or family history. The common thread for them all was a call to serve in a combat zone in defense of our great nation. Unfortunately, the combat zone followed them home, and for many, their battle is not over.

Our veterans willingly sacrificed to serve. The least we can do is ensure that they are taken care of when they return home and move on to the next phase in their lives. They’ve earned it — and the pact between the country and those who serve demands it.

"Withdrawal of US troops in Syria strengthened ISIS resurgence, DOD watchdog says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/withdrawal-of-us-troops-in-syria-strengthened-isis-dod-watchdog-says.html,"A convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij, on March 5, 2017.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

In the coming months, the U.N. estimates that upward of 30,000 Iraqi residents at al Hol, primarily women and children, will return to Iraq.

Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of State responded to a request for comment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he had not read the report, The Wall Street Journal reported, but noted that the administration ""is incredibly mindful of the success we've had versus ISIS, and the challenge that it continues to present to the world."""
Yampa Valley Housing Authority hopes to break ground on another west side affordable development in 2020,https://www.steamboatpilot.com,"['Eleanor C.

STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — The Yampa Valley Housing Authority is working toward a new affordable housing project on Steamboat Springs’ west side with the developer Gorman and Co.

The development is planned for a corner lot at the northwest side of the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and the newly built Sunlight Drive on Steamboat’s West End.

While the specifics of how many units will serve what income level hasn’t been determined, current plans for the project call for 84 rental units deed-restricted to Routt County households earning 80% to 120% of area median income with an average income of tenants in the project earning 100% of area median income.

Routt County’s area median income is currently $60,300 for a single-person household and $86,100 for a four-person household.

These income limits would be enforced by a perpetual deed restriction which could not be lifted should the property be foreclosed on.

Kimball Crangle, Gorman’s Colorado market president, said her company had been “talking peripherally” with the Housing Authority for a couple of years. The company responded to a recent request for qualifications from the Housing Authority.

“We started digging into Steamboat to see what you all probably live daily, that there is a housing crisis up here and that affordability for the local workforce is quickly evaporating, if not completely evaporated already,” she said.

Gorman operates in multiple states. In Colorado, the company has developed workforce housing projects in Vail and is in the process of completing a project in Keystone, according to Crangle and the company’s website.

The Housing Authority and Gorman aim to begin construction by May 1, 2020, and to complete the project by 2021.

“We committed to the voters that we were going to build a new project every year, and this is keeping that momentum going and building units for our local workforce and really providing more options for our local workforce, which is really important,” Housing Authority Executive Director Jason Peasley said.

Unlike the Housing Authority’s recent projects, this project would not be financed using the sale of tax credits. This means the Housing Authority will be investing more of its own money, generated by a property tax approved by voters in 2017, to subsidize each unit to undercut market rental prices. The Housing Authority will contribute $1.4 million in capital to the project.

“From a cost standpoint, it’s really no different, but on the sources side, because there are no tax credits, it means we have to target a higher income level,” Peasley said. “With higher incomes, we have more revenue, and we can, therefore, borrow more to help pay for the cost of it. Also, we as the Housing Authority will invest more money per unit.”

Terms of the project will be hashed out under a draft letter of intent that was approved in essence by the Housing Authority board Thursday. With direction from the Housing Authority board, attorneys between the two parties will be hashing out some final sticking points before it is granted final approval by Peasley and the Housing Authority board’s development committee.

Board member Catherine Carson was the sole nay vote against the approval. While she “loved the concept,” she was not comfortable with the mechanism in which the price of rent would be determined within the project.

The Housing Authority is also making progress on its other developments.

Peasley said Alpenglow Village closed Aug. 2 on the sale of its tax credits with Wells Fargo. The complex, located on Pine Grove Road, kicked off vertical construction last month and is expected to begin leasing in spring 2020.

The Housing Authority is also pursuing state tax credits to finance another project that would break ground in 2021.

Peasley said there are currently no waitlists or leasing information available for any of these housing units. Those interested should watch for information about leasing Alpenglow Village in the spring by visiting yvha.org.

“There’s essentially no way to get on a waiting list for that project (Alpenglow Village), and really any of those units, even the project we just agreed to work on,” he said.

Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/693598382/ex-deputy-fbi-director-andrew-mccabe-sues-over-what-he-calls-wrongful-firing,"Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has sued the Trump administration for what he calls his ""unlawful"" termination, arguing that his firing last year was the result of improper political interference by the president.

""It was Trump's unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,"" the complaint alleges.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed McCabe in March 2018, only hours before his 50th birthday, when his full law enforcement pension would have vested. McCabe's filing argues that he is ""entitled to his full law enforcement pension and all other benefits, privileges, and rights currently being withheld.""

In explaining the firing in April 2018, the Justice Department cited a ""lack of candor"" in McCabe's interviews with investigators looking into a 2016 media leak in the waning weeks of the presidential campaign.

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said the leak about investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation advanced McCabe's ""personal interests"" at the expense of the department's leadership.

McCabe has said those allegations were a pretext to get rid of him after months of abuse from President Trump, who had singled him out as a political scapegoat in the 2016 campaign. After McCabe's dismissal, Trump wrote on Twitter that it was a ""great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.""

To McCabe, the termination 26 hours before his scheduled retirement had everything to do with his role in protecting the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.

McCabe said he was ""singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" he said in a statement last year.

Comey said he supported McCabe after his firing. But in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Comey also said his ouster seemed appropriate, given the circumstances.

""This is what accountability looks like,"" Comey said.

Comey also said that the process had been infected with ""corrosive doubt"" because of Trump's attacks on McCabe in the past. Trump targeted McCabe in part because his wife had unsuccessfully run for state office in Virginia with support from Democrats.

Trump and Republicans said that meant McCabe was a Democrat and accordingly biased against the president, which McCabe has all along denied.

The U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., and a grand jury there have been considering whether McCabe may have broken any laws. So far no charges have been filed."
