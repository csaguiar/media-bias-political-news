Dow futures drop nearly 300 points as US-China trade war escalates,https://www.cnbc.com,['Fred Imbert'],08-25-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/25/dow-futures-drop-300-points-at-the-open-as-us-china-trade-war-escalates.html,"U.S. stock futures fell sharply on Sunday night following the latest escalation in the U.S.-China trade war by President Donald Trump.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 290 points lower, indicating a drop of 236 points at Monday's open. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to drops of around 0.8% for both indexes.

Trump tweeted Friday after the market close that the U.S. will raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25%. Tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese products will also go up to 15% from 10%, he said. The levies on the $250 billion worth of goods are scheduled to kick in Oct. 1, while the duties on the $300 billion are set to go into effect in two stages on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15.

""Sadly, past Administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of Fair and Balanced Trade that it has become a great burden to the American Taxpayer,"" Trump said in his tweets. ""As President, I can no longer allow this to happen!""

Trump later said at the G-7 summit in in Biarritz, France he regrets not raising tariffs on China even more, noting he has ""second thoughts about everything."" The president added he could declare the trade war a national emergency.

Trump's comments and tweets came after China unveiled new tariffs Friday on $75 billion worth of U.S. products, including autos. Trump had also ordered on Friday that U.S. companies move their Chinese operations elsewhere, sending U.S. stocks tumbling.

The major indexes all fell more than 2% on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 623.34 points. Those declines wiped out the weekly gains the averages had built through Thursday's close. After Friday's session, the Dow ended down 1% for the week, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite concluded the week down 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Last week also marked the indexes' fourth straight weekly loss, their longest since May.

China and the U.S. have been engaged in a trade war since last year. The economic conflict has dampened economic and corporate earnings growth expectations as investors and companies weigh its impact on the global economy. The U.S. and China are the world's largest economies.

""The ongoing Trade War is redrawing global supply chains, claiming casualties in the process,"" Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said in a note. ""As persistent headwinds intersect with traditional seasonal softness, recent volatility can be expected to continue in the near term as markets await policy developments.""

The trade war is taking place against a backdrop of softening economic growth. Germany's manufacturing sector is contracting while China's economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades in the second quarter.

The U.S. bond market has also flashed a recession signal recently. The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped below its 2-year counterpart. This phenomenon is known as a yield-curve inversion. Experts fear it because it has historically preceded recessionary periods.

This economic soft patch has led central banks to ease monetary conditions, including the Federal Reserve.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the current U.S. economic expansion, which is the longest in history. However, Powell failed to clearly signal that another rate cut was imminent in September.

""The problem facing stocks isn't restrictive monetary policy but instead Trump's destructive trade policy,"" Adam Crisafulli, executive director at J.P. Morgan, said in a note Sunday. ""Rates are already very low and low yields coupled with inverted curves are becoming counterproductive for stocks – as a result, central banks are doing about all they can right now.""

Last month, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for a September rate cut are also at 100%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Trump Allies Target Journalists Over Coverage Deemed Hostile to White House,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Kenneth P. Vogel', 'Jeremy W. Peters']",08-25-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-media.html,"WASHINGTON — A loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House is pursuing what they say will be an aggressive operation to discredit news organizations deemed hostile to President Trump by publicizing damaging information about journalists.

It is the latest step in a long-running effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to undercut the influence of legitimate news reporting. Four people familiar with the operation described how it works, asserting that it has compiled dossiers of potentially embarrassing social media posts and other public statements by hundreds of people who work at some of the country’s most prominent news organizations.

The group has already released information about journalists at CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times — three outlets that have aggressively investigated Mr. Trump — in response to reporting or commentary that the White House’s allies consider unfair to Mr. Trump and his team or harmful to his re-election prospects.

Operatives have closely examined more than a decade’s worth of public posts and statements by journalists, the people familiar with the operation said. Only a fraction of what the network claims to have uncovered has been made public, the people said, with more to be disclosed as the 2020 election heats up. The research is said to extend to members of journalists’ families who are active in politics, as well as liberal activists and other political opponents of the president."

Trump lashes out at US media amid tense G-7 summit,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-25-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/25/trump-lashes-out-at-us-media-amid-tense-g-7-summit/,"​WASHINGTON — President Trump said other world leaders are asking with why the American media is “rooting” for the country “to fail” Sunday, following reports that he was blindsided by the French​ inviting a top Iranian official​ to the G-7 summit.

“The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, ‘Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?’” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The tweet comes after media reports portrayed Trump as looking flat-footed when French President Emmanuel Macron surprised G-7 attendees by inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to appear on the sidelines of the summit​ ​in Biarritz, France.

When Trump was asked by reporters about Zarif’s rumored attendance, he replied: “no comment.”

Marcon’s invitation followed a tense Saturday night dinner in which the leaders discussed Iran’s nuclear program and whether to include Russian President Vladimir Putin in future meetings.

Trump has taken a tough ​stand on Iran, pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, while floating that he believed Putin should be invited to rejoin the G-7, which Russia was pushed out of after annexing Crimea.

On Sunday, Trump appeared to say he was having “second thoughts” about his ongoing trade war with China — before his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, and other top administration officials said he was “misinterpreted.”

“This morning in the bilat with the UK, the president was asked if he had ‘any second thought on escalating the trade war with China.’ His answer has been greatly misinterpreted,” Grisham said. “His answer has been greatly misinterpreted. President Trump responded in an affirmative — because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher.”

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the president “didn’t exactly hear the question,” despite reporters asking it in three different ways to ensure the president was understood correctly.

Before Zarif’s arrival, Kudlow said the G-7 meeting had so far been a success.

“My view was, the meeting this morning, in fact, the whole conference — including the unexpected luncheon between President Trump and President Macron — has gone very well, better than we thought, with a very positive vibe,” Kudlow said. “So I will go far and say, actually, it’s been a solid gathering.”"

Barr Seized on Epstein Case as Doubts Mounted About Justice Dept.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Benner'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/william-barr-jeffrey-epstein.html,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr was at home in his study, working on a speech, when the call came from his chief of staff: Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sex trafficking who had connections to an array of political power players, had died in federal prison.

Mr. Barr immediately knew that he would be engulfed in a scandal. The prison had promised to keep Mr. Epstein under constant surveillance until he could be tried on charges of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. With his accusers now robbed of their day in court, the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, looked incompetent at best. And as Mr. Barr scrambled for answers, unfounded conspiracy theories took root, casting an additional pall over the matter and threatening the public’s faith in the department.

Over multiple briefings an hour, Mr. Barr spent that Saturday angrily grilling his deputies. He directed the F.B.I. to investigate Mr. Epstein’s apparent suicide and the department’s inspector general to look for lapses in protocol. After the Bureau of Prisons confirmed the death and the F.B.I. inquiry that morning, Mr. Barr issued a statement, surprising officials who believed the bureau would have the last word. “Mr. Epstein’s death,” he said, “raises serious questions that must be answered.”

Attorneys general rarely follow up on inmate deaths, but Mr. Barr has continued to bird dog the investigation into how one as high-profile as Mr. Epstein could have died in federal care, evidence of how serious the matter is for the Justice Department. This account of his search for answers is based on interviews with six people involved in the investigation into Mr. Epstein’s death, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal department discussions."
Emails show Veterans Affairs officials' scorn for 'Mar-a-Lago 3',https://www.politico.com,['Arthur Allen'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/22/digital-health-platform-mar-a-lago-members-1676335,"President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is shown in Palm Beach, Florida. Emails released from Veterans Affairs senior staff show the outsized influence of three of the club's members in the agency's planning for veteran health care. | Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo Ehealth Emails show Veterans Affairs officials' scorn for 'Mar-a-Lago 3'

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

Story Continued Below

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"

A statement from Tehran's foreign ministry published in Iranian media, including the semi-official Fars news agency, accused the FDD and its CEO Mark Dubowitz of ""economic terrorism ... including spreading lies, lobbyism, propaganda against Iran,"" because of the group's mission to expose human rights violations by the Tehran regime and advocate for harsher sanctions by the U.S. against the Middle Eastern nation.

The State-run Mehr news agency wrote that the sanctions against the FDD were in line with an Iranian law enacted in 2017. The sanctions have little effect unless the target of the punishment actively uses the Iranian financial system.

The Justice Department acknowledges that a psychologist working in the New York federal detention center where disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was held had approved his removal from a suicide watch list prior to his death.

Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell on August 10 in the the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where he was being held pending trial on sex trafficking charges. A subsequent autopsy determined that he had hanged himself.

In July he had been found unconscious on the floor of his cell, prompting the suicide-watch measures.

In a three-page letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd to the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, Boyd confirmed that Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after the July incident.

""Mr. Epstein was later removed from suicide watch after being evaluated by a doctoral-level psychologist who determined that a suicide watch was no longer warranted,"" Boyd wrote.

In the wake of Epstein's death, Attorney General William Barr said there had been ""serious irregularities"" at the MCC, which is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. It is a unit of the Justice Department and under Barr's authority. Barr also blamed the MCC facility staff for failing to ""adequately secure the prisoner."" Barr reassigned the facility's warden and placed two guards who were responsible for watching Epstein on administrative leave."

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor. After she protested, Justice Department officials said some information included with the newsletter had been compiled by a third-party contractor and should not have been distributed.

""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for EOIR told BuzzFeed."

The national estimates above reflect Pro Farmer’s view on production and yields. They take into account data gathered during Crop Tour and other factors, such as crop maturity, acreage adjustments we’ve made, historical differences in Tour data versus USDA’s final yields, areas outside those sampled on Crop Tour, etc. That’s why the state yield numbers below differ from the Crop Tour figures.

Thousands of farmers, agribusiness executives and national and local media attended a series of meetings across the Midwest this week as part of the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. The Crop Tour focused on crop conditions going into the final stretch of the 2019 growing season.

Pro Farmer, a division of Farm Journal, shared its much-anticipated production estimates for the 2019 U.S. corn and soybean crops after analyzing information from the 27th annual tour and other sources.

The Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour unveiled the stresses the corn and soybean crops faced following an excessively wet spring and record-slow planting pace this year. Scouts on Crop Tour sampled around 3,000 fields across the Corn Belt in seven of the nation’s most important corn and soybean states.

Pro Farmer estimates the 2019 U.S. corn crop at 13.358 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre. That compares to USDA’s Aug. 1 estimate of 169.5 bu. per acre. For soybeans, the Pro Farmer production estimate is 3.497 billion bushels, with a national average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre, down from the 48.5 bu. per acre USDA estimated in August.

“Ear counts were lower than last year in all of the Crop Tour states as a result of the rough spring conditions,” said Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor. “We also found a corn crop that was, in many cases, multiple weeks behind in maturity due to the record-slow planting.”

While negotiating his job at EPA in May 2017, Henry Darwin also pitched a role for his wife, who he called a “legitimate environmental professional,"" according to internal emails obtained by ABC.

""It would help our financial decision immensely,"" Darwin wrote to EPA Chief of staff Ryan Jackson in the email. ""If not out of the question, I would be happy to forward her resume and references (which I would suggest you check - everyone loves her almost as much as I do).""

The former Arizona state official’s wife Veronica Darwin was later hired to be a senior adviser to the administrator for Land and Emergency Management.

Pruitt later came under fire for using his position at EPA to try to get jobs for close acquaintances, including a clerking internship for his daughter at the White House and a job for his wife opening up a Chick-fil-A franchise.

Wheeler in his email Friday said Henry Darwin will be stepping down from his role and will once again take the title of assistant deputy administrator at EPA. In the role he will “concentrate on the deployment of EPA’s Lean Management System (ELMS)” which he will do from Arizona.

“Given the amount of time he already spends traveling to the regional offices to deploy ELMS, his relocation to Phoenix should not impact his ability to help us become even more effective in carrying out our very important mission. In addition, Henry will be here at headquarters on a regular basis,” Wheeler wrote.

Wheeler announced Veronica Darwin left the agency on Aug. 9.

“While at EPA, Veronica managed implementation of the Superfund Task Force recommendations, and led other Administrator priorities like children’s health, and the development of the action plan for lead. These key initiatives will remain Administrator priorities, however Veronica’s leadership will be greatly missed,” wrote Wheeler.

A federal court ruled President Donald Trump can’t block people on Twitter, but the Trump administration isn’t giving up that easily.

The Justice Department on Friday asked the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear en banc a case challenging the president’s ability to block people on the platform.

Story Continued Below

A panel of judges from the court ruled last month that, because Trump uses his private Twitter account to announce policy and other issues of national importance, blocking users would exclude them from public discussion.

In its Friday court filing that requested a rehearing from all judges of the court, the Justice Department argued that because the @realDonaldTrump account is not owned by the federal government and has been operated by Trump in a personal capacity for years, the president can control who can have access to it.

“An official’s decision to exclude someone from his personal residence would not exercise the authority of the government, even if he were giving official statements on that property on that day,” the filing said. “And what is true for real property is likewise true for a social media account.”

The Justice Department declined to comment Friday afternoon.

The filing comes as part of a lawsuit brought by a group of Twitter users represented by Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute against Trump, his social media adviser Dan Scavino and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The court ruled at the time that the White House had referenced Trump’s Twitter account in an official capacity in the past and that public access to official communication channels was protected by the First Amendment.

In its Friday filing, the Justice Department argued that assumption would set a precedent that would mean all “public officials who address matters relating to their public office on personal accounts will run the risk that every action taken on that account will be state action subject to constitutional scrutiny.”

“The First Amendment does not warrant this type of judicial superintendence of personal social media accounts owned by public officials,” the filing said.

$16B veterans' health project hits major snag,https://www.politico.com,['Arthur Allen'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/veterans-health-project-1673379,"The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo health care $16B veterans' health project hits major snag The rollout is likely to be delayed six months, which members of Congress worry could be an early sign of trouble.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie insisted last week that the Trump administration is ""on track"" with a $16 billion project to connect medical records for the military and vets.

But that’s not exactly the case — the project faces significant delays and unanticipated headaches, according to three sources with detailed knowledge of what will be one of the largest technology contracts in federal history.

Story Continued Below

Promoters of the flagship Trump administration project say it will create a model for better-coordinated care for the whole United States, setting up a digitized health care record for millions of current and future veterans from the time they join the military. It’s a massively complex bureaucratic and technical undertaking, however, and a host of glitches have surfaced since the VA contract was signed last year, raising doubts in Congress about whether it can achieve its lofty goals.

Those problems are creating the first major hiccup for the project. Its promised March 2020 rollout at three VA medical centers — one in Spokane, Wash., the others in the Seattle area — is almost certain to be partially or completely delayed until October, the sources said.

In an op-ed published in military newspapers last week, Wilkie said the Trump administration is “working to deliver a win for veterans that prior administrations could not: a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution” that “will give [Pentagon and VA] doctors instant and seamless access to veterans’ full-service health records and history.”

Partly at the urging of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the VA decided in 2017 to sign a no-bid contract with Cerner, which the Defense Department signed up with two years earlier to replace its homegrown records system. Three members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club also have been involved in the effort — at first trying to block the Cerner contract because one of them, physician Bruce Moskowitz, didn't like its software. A cache of 2017 emails released Thursday show that the VA officials in charge of the project humored the Mar-a-Lago group while bristling under their suggestions.

“If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen,"" Rep. Susie Lee said. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo

The Pentagon’s project had gotten off on the wrong foot at four Pacific Northwest bases that year. Initially, the system lost prescriptions and made it difficult for clinicians to log on, leading terrified doctors to fear harm to their patients, as POLITICO reported at the time.

Worried the same might happen to the VA project, its congressional overseers repeatedly have urged the agency to slow the project rather than risk compromising veterans’ health care, so they are not entirely dismayed by news of the likely delay.

“I have said to the VA, time and again, that we’d rather get implementation right than to rush to meet a deadline,” said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), chairwoman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Technology Modernization Subcommittee, in an interview. “If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen.”

The VA recently decided to split the initial implementation into two blocks, one that might go live in March and April, and a second in October, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan. But this would require the VA to offer limited Cerner software to clinicians during the first phase, they said, and it would require the first phase to start at the understaffed and cramped Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center in Spokane. So the agency may hold up the whole project until October.

In a statement to POLITICO, the VA declined to say whether it would push the launch date. The VA ""is continually evaluating its path forward based on lessons learned from the Department of Defense and commercial implementations,"" the agency said. ""We are considering our options.""

A Cerner spokesperson said the VA was ""finalizing their [rollout] strategy"" and ""already ahead of where other clients would typically be at this point in implementation. We are confident we are on the track.”

""It is my understanding that VA is considering delaying the go-live at one or more of the initial Cerner cites,"" said physician and Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), ranking member of the full committee that led oversight of the project for years. ""If delaying the initial go-live date is needed to ensure that implementation is ultimately successful and patient care is enhanced rather than disrupted, then I fully support it.""

The project has been dogged by the inability of the Pentagon and VA to agree to a joint oversight board. The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said.

A new office called the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office was supposed to handle that and other coordination matters, but the office isn’t up and running yet, although the two agencies agreed to set it up last September. They recently notified Congress of the appointment of Neil Evans, a senior VA health care official, as interim leader of the office, with Pentagon health official Holly Joers as his deputy.

The various problems expected in the initial phase of the electronic records project — partial functionality of key clinical software, the need for clinicians to toggle between different software systems, and the enormous task of installing new IT hardware in the first three bases — has some congressional critics worried about the project’s direction.

“Is it going to be something better than what they currently have in VistA?” asked a second congressional source, referring to the VA's current software, which the agency developed in-house over the past 35 years. “That’s our concern.""

At a subcommittee hearing July 25, ranking member Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said the VA team had not provided answers to many questions Congress has asked about how well the system is going to work, including how data will flow between the two systems during the 10 years in which Cerner will replace VistA across the VA.

""I am skeptical that all the technical constraints are known and there aren't more intractable difficulties waiting to be discovered,"" he added.

The VA recently trumpeted the transfer of records from VistA to the Cerner data center as a major first step in the project, but far more complex tasks, such as uploading the records into Cerner’s system and making them usable for VA providers, remain, observers said.

“They have physically deposited the record on the Cerner side of the firewall, but they can’t do anything with the records,” a former VA official said, who compared the situation to having received a large encrypted file in an email.

The VA's statement said it was ""on track"" in transferring the data.

Lee and Banks also had questions about how long the VA planned to have physicians use the Joint Legacy Viewer, a discreet software program that allows a clinician to view older VA and Pentagon patient data.

The cumbersome viewer was one of the reasons the VA cited for moving to a single “seamless” heath record with the Pentagon to begin with, Lee noted. “It’s not clear how it fits into the long-term interoperability strategy, that is, how long it will be needed,” she said.

The VA said that two Cerner platforms — one with software used for patient encounters, the other with historical data and analytical tools — as well as the Joint Legacy Viewer will all be available on different ""tabs"" on the same terminal for clinicians, at least initially.

At the July 25 hearing, senior VA medical adviser Thomas O’Toole acknowledged the “challenge” of “complex clinical scenarios” where veterans are seen in different facilities and clinicians must call up multiple screens to safely review a patient’s data.

“We’re trying to identify those workflow processes in advance so clinicians know what to expect,” he said."

EPA ordered to set stronger smog standards,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458608-epa-ordered-to-set-stronger-smog-standards,"A federal appeals court has ruled in a case battling Obama-era pollution regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set stronger regulations on smog in order to protect the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA's current air quality standards for ozone are too weak to protect the environment, the standards do meet federal requirements when it comes to protecting human health.

Seth Johnson, an attorney who argued the case on behalf of Earthjustice, said the case gets to the heart of the Clean Air Act’s requirement that the EPA protect forests and natural landscapes from the ozone damage that can inhibit their growth.

The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT

But advocates warned that a win for park was not necessarily a win for people.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

While ozone helps create a protective layer in the stratosphere to protect the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet light, when at ground-level, the gas can contribute to asthma attacks and other respiratory issues.

The suit was initially brought by Murray Energy Corporation, one of the largest coal companies in the U.S.

Environmentalists and Democrats alike said the suit showed the importance of scientific evidence at trial.

Johnson said data from the EPA helped it make its case in portions of the suit, while a lack of scientific data hindered it in other areas of the case.

Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperEPA ordered to set stronger smog standards America is in desperate need of infrastructure investment: Senate highway bill a step in the right direction FARA should apply to Confucius Institutes MORE (D-Del.), ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, agreed the court took that evidence seriously.

A spokesperson for the EPA said it was reviewing the decision.

The court also rejected the argument from industry groups that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups as they try to comply with regulations.

“The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations,” the opinion said.

Johnson said he expects the EPA will have to consider human health as it reevaluates the standards through 2020."
Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumDemocrats object to Interior plans to move BLM out west Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

“The Trump administration continues to undermine the capacity of non-partisan agencies to conduct research, collect data, and make decisions based on science, rather than ideology,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Overnight Energy: Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry -- for now | 2020 Dems debate climate response at Detroit debate | Dem asks for perjury investigation into Interior nominee Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry — for now MORE (D-Maine), who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to The Hill.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Denmark as a cooperative ally following a phone call with his Danish counterpart.

Pompeo held the call with Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod Wednesday to discuss President Donald Trump's canceled state visit to the country, which had been scheduled to take place in early September.

""The Secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's cooperation as one of the United States' allies and Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""The Secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — in the Arctic.""

Denmark's Kofod said Wednesday that the conversation had been ""frank, friendly and constructive"" and affirmed the two nations' strong bond.

""(The) U.S. and Denmark are close friends and allies with a long history of active engagement across (the) globe,"" he said on Twitter. ""(We) agreed to stay in touch on full range of issues of mutual interest.""

Trump surprised Danish officials on Tuesday when he took to Twitter to announce he would no longer go to Denmark next month, with the president later dubbing Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ""nasty"" for her response to his idea that the U.S. could purchase Greenland. On Sunday, Frederiksen said Trump's suggestion of purchasing the territory was ""absurd,"" telling Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Greenland is a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The land mass is considered to be rich with coal, zinc, copper and iron ore.

Trump said Tuesday that he would reschedule his visit to Denmark ""for another time."""

EPA plans public meeting about 'Agent Orange' Superfund cleanup site in Verona,https://www.news-leader.com,"['Wes Johnson', 'Published A.M.

The Syntex Superfund site is on the west edge of Verona. (Photo: GoogleMap)

An industrial site in the small town of Verona that once manufactured the Vietnam War-era herbicide Agent Orange remains a concern to local officials, who fear the site may be polluting water wells in the area.

The 180-acre Syntex tract on the west edge of town was declared an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund Cleanup site in 1983, and tons of dioxin-contaminated soil and equipment were removed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Dioxin was a byproduct of manufacturing Agent Orange, and later from the production of the antibacterial chemical hexachlorophene at the site. Now, Verona mayor pro tem Claude Carr said he fears water wells are being contaminated by chemicals he believes are coming from the site.

On Tuesday, EPA officials will have a public meeting from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at the Verona High School cafeteria to talk about what has been done to clean up the contamination, as well as ongoing studies of the area. Verona has a population of about 600 people.

""They're supposed to do a five-year update every five years since 1988, but they've not done a good job informing the community with that,"" Carr said. ""Several of the wells around here have tested bad and they're not wanting to do anything about it.""

News: More than 400 hepatitis A cases confirmed in Missouri

The town of Verona gets its water from nearby Aurora, not individual water wells. But people living outside of Verona still rely on groundwater from wells for their drinking water.

In 1993, the EPA concluded ""no further remedial action"" was needed for groundwater because water samples taken from beyond the site showed no levels of hazardous material higher than ""acceptable health-based standards.""

In its fact sheet about the site, the EPA also notes that “Data collected since the 2012 FYR (Five Year Review), including limited private well sampling, does not indicate exposure to site contaminants above a level of health concern.”

However, another company — BCP Ingredients — bought a portion of the Syntex site in 2001 and has been manufacturing a product called choline chloride, ""a nutritive additive commonly used in animal and human food and supplements,"" according to DNR.

According to DNR, a byproduct of that process is the hazardous chemical dioxane, which has been detected at the Superfund site. DNR notes that water well sampling of two farms downstream from the Superfund site found no contamination levels ""at or above levels of a health concern.""

The latest EPA five-year review of the Superfund site was completed in September 2017. According to DNR, the reviews are done to ensure that cleanup efforts are still protecting public health. But because of questions about the presence and source of dioxane, the EPA says more study is needed.

According to DNR's fact sheet about the Syntex site: ""The most recent review, conducted on Sept.28, 2017, concluded that EPA cannot determine the remedy’s protectiveness until they conduct further groundwater monitoring, conduct 1,4-dioxane analyses, and conduct a risk assessment.""

It's likely that those issues and potential risks to public health will be a focus of Tuesday's public meeting.

Aside from water well concerns, Carr, Verona's mayor pro tem, said he and some Verona residents also questioned why Syntex purchased a 60-acre farm on the north side of the Superfund site. Carr said Syntex put up an industrial fence around the property, which abuts the Superfund site.

Karen Heinold, a spokeswoman for Syntex Agribusiness, confirmed the 2018 purchase but said the farmer approached the company with an offer to sell the land when his family decided to move.

""This purchase allows Syntex to have continued access to the property in connection with the ongoing environmental review of the former Syntex site,"" she said in an email. ""The fence around the property is intended to prevent trespassing.

""Syntex currently does not have any long-term plans for the property.""

Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Tom Angell']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a comprehensive plan on Friday that calls for “decriminalizing all drug possession” in his first presidential term as a means to combat the opioid epidemic and treat addiction as a public health, rather than criminal justice, issue.

Decriminalization is just one action the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said he’d pursue in order to reform the country’s mental health care system and bolster substance abuse treatment. His plan also includes proposals to reduce sentences for drug offenses other than possession, increase access to the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone and make it easier to implement syringe exchange programs.

Buttigieg’s “Healing and Belonging in America” plan emphasizes the need to divert people suffering from addiction away from prisons and into treatment. He said he’d accomplish that by expanding diversionary programs and evidence-based training “for drug courts, mental health courts, and other alternatives to incarceration for justice-involved persons.”

The goal of decriminalization and diversion is to reduce “the number of people incarcerated due to mental illness or substance use by 75 percent in the first term.”

Our country is in the midst of a mental health and addiction crisis, worsened by decades of stigma and political neglect. I’ll bring a new approach, rooted in commitment and community, to tackle this crisis with the urgency it deserves. https://t.co/spBoh5KH4X — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 23, 2019

Under his plan, sentencing reform for drug offenses other than possession would be applied retroactively and coupled with expungements for past convictions. Buttigieg pointed to research demonstrating that “incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths” and instead “actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

“We cannot incarcerate ourselves out of this public health problem.”

“To ensure that people with a mental illness or substance use disorder can heal, we will decriminalize these conditions,” the proposal states. “When someone is undergoing a crisis or is caught using a drug, they should be treated by a health professional rather than punished in a jail cell.”

“All presidential candidates should join Pete Buttigieg in recognizing that the criminalization of people for their drug use is wrong and simply bad policy,” Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Action, said in a press release. “Possession of drugs for personal use is the single most arrested offense in the United States, eclipsing arrest rates for any other offense. With overdose numbers skyrocketing and entire communities, disproportionately black or brown, suffering from criminalization, it’s time for policymakers to shift gears. Taking an evidence-based, health-centered approach to address this crisis is not only true leadership – it’s common sense.”

The mayor also made harm reduction policies a key component of his strategy. He said take-home naloxone programs would be expanded to all 50 states by 2024 and that harm reduction services would be expanded “to reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases related to needle sharing.”

The plan would make naloxone “broadly available in order to reverse overdoses” and remove “legislative and regulatory restrictions on the use of federal funds for syringe service programs.”

Buttigieg said the federal government should provide funding for state and local health departments to purchase the medication, make sure that it’s “available in public spaces and workplaces” similar to first aid kids and encourage “co-prescribing of naloxone with opioids, either by individual physicians or direct dispensing by pharmacists.”

Existing federal law makes it difficult to establish syringe exchange programs, in part because federal funds can’t be used to buy needles. The restrictions “hamper state and local responses, both because they limit resources and because they convey a negative message about the value of these programs, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that they can prevent transmission of HIV and hepatitis.”

In addition to lifting those barriers, the candidate said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “would also work with states to remove any criminal liability for those participating in” syringe exchange programs.

“Harm reduction programs are a critical part of any effective response to the opioid and injection drug use crisis. They minimize the negative impact of drug use without encouraging it, while reducing other side effects of drug use. In particular, this means access to syringe service programs for people who inject drugs, that link them to treatment, and provides access to sterile syringes. These programs help prevent transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis, and other infectious diseases associated with needle sharing, and reduce overdoses by deploying medication such as naloxone that help reverse the effects of opioids.”

One harm reduction policy that didn’t make the cut in Buttigieg’s plan is safe injection sites, where people could use illicit drugs under the supervision of medical professionals who could reverse overdoses and recommend treatment options. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who are also running for the Democratic nomination, both proposed legalizing such facilities as part of criminal justice reform plans they released this month.

“Decades of failed mental health and addiction policy, coupled with mass incarceration that criminalized mental illness and drug use, have left us with a mental health and addiction care system so broken that today there are more people with serious mental illness in prisons than in treatment facilities,” Buttigieg said.

The candidate also made ending incarceration for drug possession—as well as legalizing marijuana—central principles of his previously released criminal justice reform plan, which he released last month.

But while the prior plan did not explicitly describe the move as “decriminalizing” drugs, even though advocates commonly use that word to refer to policies that remove the threat of being imprisoned for possession, the new document does use that terminology—signaling a shift in clarity as Buttigieg continues to develop his campaign messaging.

In other instances, he borrowed language from his criminal justice reform plan, specifically as it concerns how criminalizing drug use can increase rates of overdose, for his mental health proposal.

“Despite equal rates of use, Black Americans are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for using marijuana,” the criminal justice plan states. “Research shows that incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths. In fact, some studies show that incarceration actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

Buttigieg mentioned that, as with drug offenses, black people are also more likely to die from overdoses. And that’s due to “the current broken system that criminalizes mental illness and addiction” that was “built during the crack epidemic of the 1980s.”

Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

Kathy McCoy CBS News

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

Robert Levy Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Park Police chief MacLean promoted to top Interior Dept. law enforcement post,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/08/22/park-police-chief-robert-maclean-promoted-top-interior-law-enforcement-post/,"

U.S. Park Police Chief Robert D. MacLean. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

U.S. Park Police Chief Robert D. MacLean, who has led the uniformed force since 2013, is being promoted to head the Interior Department’s Office of Law Enforcement and Security, overseeing law enforcement programs including the Park Police and officers in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Interior Department said Thursday.

MacLean, 53, has been a Park Police officer for 28 years. He did not return a request for comment. The move was first reported by Paul Wagner of Fox 5 News.

During MacLean’s tenure, unarmed motorist Bijan Ghaisar was fatally shot by two Park Police officers on Nov. 17, 2017. After Ghaisar was shot in a residential neighborhood of Fairfax County, Va., MacLean had his detectives begin a homicide investigation and told Fairfax police they were not needed, exercising the federal jurisdiction of the Park Police. Three days later, MacLean handed the case over to the FBI, though the bureau had not responded to the scene the night of the slaying. Ghaisar’s parents said Park Police officers treated them insensitively while Ghaisar, 25, lay in a coma, refusing to allow them to see their son for more than 10 minutes each hour or to touch him.

[Video shows Park Police fired nine shots into Bijan Ghaisar's Jeep at close range, killing him]

No decision has been made about whether to charge the officers involved in the shooting, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya. U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil rights division declined to comment earlier this week on when a charging decision might be made. Twenty-two months have passed since Ghaisar was killed.

Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly Ghaisar, was outraged by MacLean’s promotion. “Every time I even start to allow myself to think there might be some hope for justice, I get hit with news like this,” she said Thursday. “Chief MacLean allowed, and possibly ordered, his officers to guard my son’s body and treat my family in the most racist way possible. The U.S. Park Police have sat on this case after killing our son. It is a disgrace that it has taken this long to investigate this murder. This is another example of a law enforcement supervisor getting promoted despite obvious evidence of conduct that would likely end any other career.”

MacLean has remained silent about the shooting, refusing to disclose the names of the officers involved or details about why they shot. After MacLean refused to release videos of the shooting recorded by two Fairfax County police officers, Fairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. in January 2018 released one of the videos that appeared to document the entire episode. MacLean declined to comment on the video.

When The Washington Post obtained the names of Vinyard and Amaya in the summer of 2018, MacLean refused a Freedom of Information Act request seeking to confirm the two men were Park Police officers, saying it was “personal information” and “would not shed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.”

Vinyard and Amaya’s names were released to the Ghaisar family by Fairfax County police, who publicly disclosed them in a lawsuit against the officers and the Park Police in March. They remain on paid administrative duty. The lawsuit is pending.

The Park Police are not equipped with body cameras or in-car cameras. No federal agents wear cameras. In response to the Ghaisar shooting, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced legislation requiring federal uniformed officers to use such cameras, and they said MacLean told them he supported the legislation. MacLean has not publicly commented on the idea, which has not had a hearing in Congress.

[D.C.-area lawmakers reintroduce bill requiring body-worn, in-car cameras for federal officers]

The Park Police have about 700 officers in Washington, New York and San Francisco. MacLean previously worked on the department’s SWAT team and in internal affairs, headed its homeland security division, was the department spokesman, and served on a crime and violence task force with D.C. police and other agencies. MacLean helped oversee security and planning for major events on the Mall such as inaugurations and Independence Day festivities.

His department was criticized in 2017 when Park Police officers twice handcuffed youths selling water on the Mall. “We have to come up with better alternatives to handcuffing or having juveniles handcuffed and exposed out in the public for that long,” MacLean said.

The Park Police were also criticized by an inspector general’s audit in 2014 for “dysfunction” in communication after not finding a traveler who wandered from Reagan National Airport and died.

MacLean’s new job with the Interior Department involves overseeing law enforcement, security and intelligence activities for seven agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service rangers, the Park Police, the Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Fish and Wildlife refuge law enforcement officers, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Reclamation. The law enforcement office is described as the Interior Department’s “focal point to provide program guidance and oversight of the Department’s law enforcement, security, intelligence, counterintelligence/insider threat, and information sharing programs,” according to the office website.

In announcing the job, Susan Combs, the assistant interior secretary for policy, management and budget, said, “Chief MacLean has a stellar record protecting visitors and resources and is proud of the partnerships he has forged that have focused on the mutual law enforcement mission that transcends organizational jurisdiction and structure.” He is expected to begin in his new post on Sept. 16, Combs said in an email to Interior Department employees.

Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."
"DHS cyber agency to prioritize election security, Chinese threats",https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458487-dhs-cyber-agency-to-prioritize-election-security-chinese-threats,"The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) plans to prioritize election security, cybersecurity at federal agencies, and the “persistent threat” posed by China, among its many goals.

The agency laid out its key priorities in a new “strategic intent” document released on Thursday, which CISA Director Christopher Krebs described in the introduction as the “keystone” for the agency.

Among Krebs’s operational priorities is addressing Chinese threats to U.S. supply chains and to the rollout of 5G networks, bolstering election security efforts at the state and local level, and protecting the cybersecurity of industrial control systems.

Other priorities are protecting federal networks against cyber attacks, such as ransomware incidents that have increasingly spread across the country, and defending “soft targets” and crowded venues from physical threats.

CISA is the primary agency responsible for assisting state and local governments with securing elections, replacing the former National Protection and Programs Directorate in a law that took effect last year.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonPelosi asks Democrats for 'leverage' on impeachment DHS cyber agency to prioritize election security, Chinese threats Trump officials unveil rule allowing indefinite migrant family detentions MORE (D-Miss.) said in a statement on Thursday that he was “encouraged to see that Director Krebs has a strategy and a vision to guide CISA at this pivotal time.”

“We know that our Nation’s banks, hospitals, power plants, election systems, and state and local governments are under constant attack, and CISA must stand ready to help these owners and operators shore up their defenses,” Thompson said. “This Strategic Intent document sets forth an ambitious agenda, and I hope to hear more from Director Krebs about how he plans to execute the priorities outlined today, and what resources CISA will need in order to do so.”

Krebs, who is the agency’s first director, laid out the strategic plan during a speech on Thursday at Auburn University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security in Auburn, Ala. He emphasized CISA’s core mission of “defend today, secure tomorrow.”

Krebs noted that he spends “probably 40 to 50 percent” on election security issues, adding that the 2018 midterm elections were secure in large part due to strides forward in securing elections against outside interference in the wake of the 2016 elections.

“I know what the Russians did in 2016, I know what they tried to do in 2018, I need to know what they’re going to try to do in 2020,” Krebs said.

Former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerMueller report fades from political conversation Trump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony MORE's report found that Russian actors hacked into the computer system of the Democratic National Committee, engineered a social media disinformation campaign that favored President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham: America must 'accept the pain that comes in standing up to China' Weld 'thrilled' more Republicans are challenging Trump New data challenges Trump's economic narrative MORE and conducted intrusion operations against those working on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump preps conspiracy theory to explain faltering economy The ideological divide on vaping has a clear winner: Smokers Biden struggles to hit it off with millennials MORE’s presidential campaign.

Mueller testified last month on Capitol Hill that he expects the Russians to return and try to interfere during the 2020 elections.

Another key issue touched on in the strategy is addressing threats from China. Krebs said he has “significant concerns” in regards to Chinese tech companies being involved in the 5G rollout in the U.S., pointing to the Chinese intelligence law that requires companies to assist in the national intelligence work of the Chinese government.

“Why on earth would we put them in a position to control whether our communications systems are up or down?” Krebs said. “That is the threshold issue here.”"
Eugene Robinson: Trump is unfiltered and untethered to reality,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Eugene Robinson', 'The Washington Post']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/23/eugene-robinson-trump-is/,"Washington • The flood of bizarre pronouncements and behavior from President Trump is likely to get worse, I fear. He is now completely unfiltered — and, apparently, increasingly untethered to reality.

Quick, can you name the White House press secretary? Do you have any idea what she looks or sounds like? Stephanie Grisham has held that job for nearly two months now, but if her name doesn't ring any bells, it's because she hasn't yet given a single official press briefing. Trump has foolishly decided to act as his own exclusive spokesman, putting all his prejudices, misconceptions, resentments, insecurities, grudges and fears on ugly display.

The result is what we witnessed Wednesday on the White House lawn. On his way to the waiting Marine One chopper, Trump paused and took questions from reporters for 35 minutes, unfazed by the midday 89-degree heat and smothering humidity. He made much news and little sense.

When he looked to the sky and proclaimed that “I am the chosen one,” he was clearly referring to his trade war with China. But you had to wonder whether his egomania, which we’re accustomed to, may have blossomed into full-scale delusions of grandeur.

Again and again, he tried desperately to compare himself favorably with his predecessor, Barack Obama. He did so by telling ridiculous lies that are easily disproved by the historical record — no, Obama didn’t institute the cruel policy of separating thousands of migrant families at the border, Trump did; no, Obama wasn’t denied permission to land Air Force One in the Philippines. You had to wonder whether Trump, who was the loudest voice in the racist “birther” movement, might have some kind of obsession with Obama and his continuing popularity around the world.

Trump said he canceled his planned state visit to Denmark because the Danish prime minister was “nasty” in calling Trump’s desire to purchase Greenland “absurd.” It is absurd, of course, but leave that aside. It happens that Obama is scheduled to visit Denmark in September. Might Trump have feared that he would be met with protests and then have to watch Obama bask in the adulation of much bigger crowds?

We also heard Trump repeat and amplify his offensive claim that American Jews who vote for Democrats are being ""disloyal"" to Israel. The notion of dual loyalty is a vile anti-Semitic trope that goes back centuries. Does Trump think dredging it up somehow helps him politically? Or is it one of a host of deep-seated ethnic and racial stereotypes that he now blurts out because no one is empowered to stop him?

If the president seems to be spiraling out of control, it's no doubt because he's frantically worried about losing his bid for reelection — but also because the insulation that once surrounded him has been stripped bare.

Insider accounts of the Trump White House have spoken of the rages, obsessions, fixations and biases that spill out of the president behind closed doors. But there were officials in place who could temper his rashest impulses. For a time, former chief of staff John Kelly even managed to establish some measure of control over the flow of information to and from the president — a necessity for any administration to be able to set priorities and follow through on them.

But Kelly is gone, along with everyone else who had the stature, experience and courage to at least try to make this mess into a functional presidency. The information flow? Now it's whatever Trump watches on Fox News — or hate-watches on CNN or MSNBC — and immediately tweets about.

Trump's most influential remaining adviser is Stephen Miller, the anti-immigration zealot who survives by applauding and reinforcing Trump's worst instincts. When Trump said Wednesday that the administration wants to end birthright citizenship (which the Constitution guarantees), everyone could guess where that was coming from.

Article continues below

Cabinet members are like the guy in the parade who walks behind the elephant with a broom and dustpan. After Trump abruptly canceled his trip to Denmark, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hurried to offer words of reassurance to the Danish foreign minister. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, a strident budget hawk his entire career, has apparently just given up as the deficit soars toward $1 trillion.

The nation and the world need a competent, capable White House, but won't have one anytime soon. Instead, we've got a teetotaling president who sounds like the angry guy at the end of the bar, mouthing off about whatever he sees when he looks up at the television. Closing time can't come fast enough.

USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Why does Kevin Moley still have a job at the State Department?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Daniel W. Drezner', 'Daniel W. Drezner Is A Professor Of International Politics At The Fletcher School Of Law', 'Diplomacy At Tufts University', 'A Regular Contributor To']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/22/why-does-kevin-moley-still-have-job-state-department/,"Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been highly critical of how the Trump administration has treated the State Department. Morale was awful under Rex Tillerson and has barely improved under successor Mike Pompeo. The situation was so bad in 2017 that even Trump appointees publicly acknowledged the morale problem. In 2019, Foreign Service officers keep leaving the administration, writing Washington Post op-eds to explain: “More and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home. … I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration.”

Still, perhaps Pompeo means what he says about returning the swagger to the State Department. Susan Glasser’s recent New Yorker profile of him was not terribly flattering but acknowledged that morale had improved somewhat. In a recent interview with the Washington Examiner, Pompeo pledged: “I want to make the State Department a place where people want to come serve. I always think when you’re responsible for a team that one of the things you can do that outlasts your time and service is that you can create a culture and an environment where the best and brightest from all across America want to come be [a] part of that team.”

Furthermore, Pompeo has taken action when his subordinates behave badly. Earlier this month, Pompeo fired policy planning director Kiron Skinner for her “abusive” management style. According to Politico’s Eliana Johnson and Nahal Toosi, “State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language.” This secretary of state is unafraid to take tough actions to eliminate bad eggs, even when such actions threaten his pet projects.

That leads me to the question animating today’s column and directed at Pompeo: Why does Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley still have a job?

Some background: Fourteen months ago, Foreign Policy’s Colum Lynch and Robbie Gramer broke a story alleging that Mari Stull, a political appointee in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (IO), was vetting the political affiliation and views of career employees. This would violate the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as well as the guidelines laid out in the Foreign Affairs Manual. Stull worked for and was appointed by Moley, the assistant secretary of state for IO. In response to the article, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened an investigation into the matter.

OIG published its findings last week in a 30-page report that incriminates both Stull and Moley. Some of the highlights:

“Throughout its review of the IO Bureau, OIG found that the leadership of IO failed to meet the Department’s Leadership and Management Principles. Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff. Then-Under Secretary Shannon told OIG that IO employees had described to him a negative and ‘vindictive’ environment in IO cultivated by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull.”

“Several current and former IO employees reported that Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff. Senior Department officials outside of IO were particularly concerned about such treatment directed at more junior employees.”

“Other employees reported that they were reprimanded by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull for following established Department policies and procedures.”

“Assistant Secretary Moley criticized employees when they told him that official travel that he planned in May 2018 did not qualify for first class accommodations under the Department’s travel policies and accused them of ‘not fighting hard enough’ to meet his demands.”

There’s plenty more, but those excerpts provide the general idea.

There are two other points worth noting. The first is that the problems were severe enough for acting director general for the Foreign Service William Todd, undersecretary for political affairs Thomas Shannon, Shannon’s successor Stephen Mull and deputy secretary John Sullivan to meet with Moley at various points to discuss Stull’s bad behavior, as well as sagging morale at IO.

The second is that Moley’s mismanagement of the situation led to an exodus of IO staff. As the OIG report says, “Approximately 50 of 300 domestic IO employees have departed IO since Assistant Secretary Moley took over its leadership, and nearly all of the former employees who OIG interviewed stated that poor leadership of the bureau contributed to their decision to depart.”

OIG recommended disciplinary action for Moley. (Stull left the State Department in January.) The State Department responded by saying that Moley “has been counseled by Department leaders on appropriate leadership and management of the bureau. Further discipline will be considered following OIG’s assessment of [Moley’s] response to the draft OIG report.” Moley’s response is included in the final OIG report, and it’s pretty laughable. Moley tries to pin most of the blame on Stull. But his denials contradict what Sullivan and Shannon told OIG and other facts OIG discovered.

Given Moley’s fact-challenged response, those who care about U.S. diplomacy — which presumably includes Pompeo — should hope he is gone soon. The day after the OIG report was released, Politico’s Toosi reported widespread frustration that Moley still had a job, especially given that Pompeo fired Skinner for similar transgressions: “If Moley isn’t fired, it sets a bad precedent for holding anyone else accountable, current and former staffers argued. ‘It’s offensive that [Moley] is collecting a taxpayer-funded paycheck today,’ one staffer said.”

The Los Angeles Times’s Tracy Wilkinson reported that “morale is sinking” at the State Department and that further resignations from Foreign Service officers are pending. Keeping Moley around despite documented examples of horrible management seems like a surefire way for Pompeo to contradict his pledge to “make the State Department a place where people want to come serve.”

Pompeo’s principal calling card as secretary of state has been his willingness to make the Faustian bargain of staying in President Trump’s good graces. It would be nice if he showed that he cared as much about the workplace culture of his employees as he does about the whims of the president. What happens to Moley will be an interesting test of whether Pompeo means what he says."
"DHS moves to end limits on detention of migrant families, close 'loophole'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-detention-migrant-families,"The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would move to scrap a major court agreement in order to allow for migrant families to be detained longer as their cases are being considered, instead of having to release them after 20 days.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in a press conference detailing the decision, claimed that the long-standing court order known as the Flores agreement has incentivized illegal immigration and represents a ""loophole"" in the immigration system.

That agreement prohibited children from being kept in detention for more than 20 days. As a result, officials were releasing entire families to keep them from being separated -- though last year, the administration did separate families as part of a ""zero tolerance"" program that eventually was stopped amid a bipartisan outcry.

BORDER PATROL NABS NEARLY 200 CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS NEAR NEW MEXICO PORT OF ENTRY

""Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” McAleenan said. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

The Flores ruling came about as a result of a 1980s case in which a girl named Jenny Flores, then 15, was detained with adults by U.S. authorities after she fled El Salvador. Beginning in 1997, the Flores settlement called for migrant children to be sent to care programs after 20 days, and be given access to medical treatment and visits with relatives. McAleenan said the new rule takes the place of Flores, while keeping many of its terms.

The new rule is slated to go into effect in 60 days, though the change is sure to face a new court challenge.

In July, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused McAleenan and other administration officials of seeking to scrap the Flores Settlement, with the alleged goal ""to keep kids longer"" in custody.

McAleenan pushed back against that characterization. He explained that he wanted to keep families together for the time necessary it takes for immigration proceedings to go through, and for the justice system to make a ruling on the case.

“We want to keep families together through an immigration proceeding that's fair and expeditious in an appropriate setting,” he said. “That can't be done in 20 days with due process.""

Democrats have slammed the detentions as “inhumane."" When the new rule was announced, the ACLU called it ""another cruel attack on children,"" by allowing them to be held for longer than previously allowed.

""The government should NOT be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer,"" they said.

Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro vowed to end all detention if he wins the presidency.

""Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative,"" he tweeted after McAleenan's announcement.

Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have claimed that the current system has resulted in children being used, repeatedly, by adults posing as family members to get into the U.S.

“This is a sick system, it’s rotten to its core,” Graham told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in July, stating that 30 percent of those who cross into the U.S. with children are “fake families,” and that loopholes are used to let the same children come back over and over, bringing different adults with them.

McAleenan said approximately 6,000 migrants fraudulently presented themselves as families in the past fiscal year.

""No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

In addition to putting an end to the 20-day limit, the plans announced Wednesday also set standards for detention facilities, which have been criticized by members of both parties for not having sufficient resources to keep people in proper living conditions.

""The new rule establishes a high national standard for care of children and families in custody,"" McAleenan said, noting that maintaining proper standards of care is a ""core"" element of the new rule.

GOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458474-republican-oversight-report-shows-interior-head-met-with-groups,"Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a report Thursday examining Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s calendar and alleged conflicts of interest in an effort to counter an ongoing investigation by Democrats.

But the report appears to confirm Bernhardt met with a group he recused himself from dealing with as part of his ethics pledge.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have yet to release a report, but Republicans launched their own probe after they said Democrats launched an investigation without consulting them and issued an “unprecedented and overbroad initial document request.”

Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for a number of oil and gas companies, has been under fire from Democrats and environmental groups since joining the Trump administration as deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior (DOI). Democrats argue his background leaves him with a wealth of conflicts of interest, and have accused him of violating public records laws with how he

manages his calendar

.

The GOP report lists a number of findings, the majority of which state that, “contrary to allegations,” Bernhardt is not mismanaging his calendar, obfuscating meetings or violating ethics laws. Republicans instead accused Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsGOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients Nadler asks other House chairs to provide records that would help panel in making impeachment decision Nikki Haley voices 'complete support' for Pence MORE (D-Md.) and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) of using “cherry-picked information to create a false impression"" about transparency at Interior.

“This interim staff report sets the record straight about the allegations levied against Bernhardt and DOI. The record is clear that contrary to public allegations of wrongdoing, DOI and Bernhardt have acted appropriately and ethically in maintaining and preserving the Secretary’s calendar records, as well as making them publicly available,” the GOP report said.

But Bernhardt's critics say the report shows he took meetings with former clients.

One part of the report aims to dissect a meeting of interest to Democrats involving Bernhardt and nine oil and gas companies.

That included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA), a division of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA).

“LMOGA appears to have an association to an entity on Bernhardt’s recusal list, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, but it does not appear that this association would require a recusal in all circumstances,” the report said.

Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, which has criticized Bernhardt’s ethics record, said the secretary should not meet with a division of a group on his recusal list.

“They don’t ‘appear to have an affiliation’ — they are part of USOGA,” Weiss said. “They are on Bernhardt's recusal list.”

A spokesperson for Interior said another oil company, Statoil, did not attend the meeting because of advice from Interior ethics officials.

""Secretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he takes his ethics pledge very seriously. He seeks advice from career ethics officials before taking any meeting involving external parties and strictly follows their advice and guidance,"" a spokesman for the agency told The Hill.

The Hill has reached out to Oversight Republicans for further comment on the LMOGA meeting.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee did not respond to request for comment, but Oversight Democrats say the report from their Republican colleagues left many questions unanswered.

“The Republican Staff Report provides cover for the Trump Administration’s secrecy. The Committee still has unanswered questions about who Secretary David Bernhardt met with, when, and why. The Committee is also concerned about how the Department maintains records of Secretary Bernhardt’s meetings, as well as its compliance with FOIA, which remains a serious problem,” Cummings said in a statement to The Hill.

Interior has been under fire for a number of actions critics say make the department less transparent, from a public records policy that would give political hires more influence over what documents are released to leaving controversial meetings off of Bernhardt’s public calendar.

Interior previously outlined how meeting requests would be vetted by ethics officials before being added to the schedule on a Google document. Some meetings were added to the public calendar, but others were placed on “daily cards” used to outline Bernhardt’s schedule.

“Bernhardt’s calendars are not created to be public documents, but instead used as an internal method of allocating his time,” the report said.

House Democrats have questioned whether the method violates public record-keeping laws, but Interior said an outside review found the process did not result is destruction of federal records.

""We are pleased the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) found the Department of the Interior to be in full compliance with records management laws. We appreciate their thorough and professional review in response to Congressional inquiries,” Interior told The Hill in July.

The GOP report includes high praise for Bernhardt, saying he “is improving the ‘anemic’ ethics environment of the Obama administration” and repeatedly lists witness testimony saying Bernhardt has not violated ethics or public record keeping laws.

Weiss said the report cherry-picks interviews and hopes that all of them will be released publicly.

“This is truly a ridiculous document that reads like it was written by Bernhardt himself,” he said.

Did DOJ Say Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Force Women to Wear Skirts?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/doj-women-skirts-christian/,"On Aug. 19, 2019, the left-leaning website Shareblue Media published an article with the headline “[Department of Justice] Says Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Make Women Wear Skirts,” which reported that:

This term, the Supreme Court will hear a case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to determine whether trans employees can be fired simply for being trans…Currently, the case is before the Supreme Court, to be heard in the 2019-2020 term, and the government has flipped sides. Last week, the Department of Justice wrote a brief arguing the case that the EEOC won in the appellate court should now be reversed, urging the Court to hand a victory to the Christian funeral home owner. The DOJ’s stance is so appalling that the EEOC refused to sign onto the brief. The argument of Solicitor General Noel Francisco, a Trump nominee, is that Title VII is limited only to discrimination based on “biological sex” only and therefore doesn’t cover the firing of Stephens for being transgender. Put another way, the DOJ is arguing that Title VII applies when, say, women are treated worse at a job then men are, but not when transgender workers are treated worse at work than non-transgender workers. It gets worse. The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said “the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man” and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work. You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.

We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Shareblue’s claim that the DOJ had articulated or supported the view that Christian employers should be legally allowed to force female employees to wear a skirt at work.

Background

The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case in question for consideration in July 2018. As of August 2019, it was scheduled for oral arguments in October. Based on accounts filed by the employer Harris Funeral Homes, the employee Aimee Stephens, and the DOJ, as well as an earlier Court of Appeals opinion, the following is the rough sequence of events at the heart of this important but at times complicated case.

Employment and termination

In 2007, Stephens was hired by Harris Homes, which has three funeral-home locations in Michigan. Stephens had been born biologically male and assigned that gender at birth, was given the name William Anthony Beasley Stephens, and went by “Anthony.”

In 2013, she informed her employer that she intended to live as a woman, which she had regarded for a long time as her true gender identity, and that as part of that transition, she intended to have gender-reassignment surgery. That would require living and working as a woman for a year first, and Stephens told Harris Homes she would take a vacation, and would “return to work as [her] true self,” with the intention of presenting herself as a woman and complying with the company’s dress code for women by wearing a skirt and suit jacket at work. Male employees were required to wear a suit and tie.

Before she took that vacation, the owner of the company, Thomas Rost, terminated Stephens’ employment. Stephens filed a sex-discrimination complaint with the federal Equality Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that Rost had fired her “due to her sex and gender identity.” (The EEOC also found the company had discriminated against female employees by providing suits for male workers, free of charge, but not providing an equal allowance to women. Harris Homes changed that particular policy in 2014 and now provides all workers a clothing allowance.)

EEOC and the U.S. District Court

The EEOC investigated Stephens’ complaint and ultimately decided to apply to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 2014, seeking an injunction against Harris Funeral Homes. The agency alleged that — in violation of federal non-discrimination law — the company had “fired Stephens because Stephens is transgender, because of Stephens’s transition from male to female, and/or because Stephens did not conform to [Harris Homes’] sex- or gender-based preferences, expectations or stereotypes.”

The company applied to have the case dismissed, but the District Court denied that motion. However, the court said the EEOC could not claim Title VII discrimination (after Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act) solely on the basis of Stephens’ status as a transgender person, because gender identity was not one of the types of discrimination prohibited by law. (They are: race, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and pregnancy.)

However, the District Court said the EEOC could bring a claim that alleged Harris Homes had engaged in impermissible “sex stereotyping,” based on the fact that Stephens’ firing was related to her stated intention to not wear the clothes prescribed under the company’s male dress code.

(In a precedent-setting 1988 case called “Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said evidence of workplace discrimination based on sex and gender stereotypes could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex-based discrimination. That case revolved around a woman who was denied a partnership at the firm, partly because some decision-makers viewed her behavior and demeanor to be insufficiently “ladylike.” The court found that while the discrimination was not, strictly-speaking, based on the mere fact of her sex, it was inextricably linked to her sex, and could not, by definition, have taken place without reference to her sex. As such, the court concluded, it amounted to legally prohibited sex discrimination.)

In the end, the District Court concluded that Harris Homes had indeed engaged in sex discrimination against Stephens on the basis of the “sex stereotyping” claim, but said the company was exempt from federal non-discrimination law based on the protections provided through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

(In the Stephens case, company owner Rost, a devout Christian, posited a religious objection to continuing to employ a person who would use a dress code different from that of an assigned, biological sex at birth, stating: “… The Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man.”)

The EEOC appealed the District Court’s decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Court of Appeals

In March 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s ruling, finding that Harris Homes did engage in impermissible “sex stereotyping” sex discrimination, and rejecting the company’s claim that sex stereotyping was only impermissible discrimination if it had a disproportionately negative impact on one gender class of employees.

The court also found that Rost had a legitimate right to a religious objection to employing Stephens, but that even the legislation which codified that constitutional right (RFRA) allowed for “greater good” exceptions, where the state has an overriding interest in protecting someone from discrimination, which the court saw as being the case here.

Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, the Court of Appeals also contradicted the District Court’s ruling that the EEOC could not proceed against Harris Homes on the basis of a “pure” discrimination claim. According to the Court of Appeals, gender identity was, in fact, a grounds for a discrimination claim, under federal non-discrimination laws.

In the court’s published opinion, Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote:

“We also hold that discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status violates Title VII … First, it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee’s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee’s sex … We ask whether Stephens would have been fired if Stephens had been a [biological] woman who sought to comply with the women’s dress code. The answer quite obviously is no. This, in and of itself, confirms that Stephens’s sex impermissibly affected Rost’s decision to fire Stephens.

“… Second, discrimination against transgender persons necessarily implicates Title VII’s proscriptions against sex stereotyping … an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of transgender status without imposing its stereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align. There is no way to disaggregate discrimination on the basis of transgender status from discrimination on the basis of gender non-conformity, and we see no reason to try.”

In July 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and was scheduled to hear oral arguments in early October 2019.

DOJ Stance

On Aug. 16, the DOJ filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing on behalf of the federal government that the court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision, thus ruling in favor of Harris Homes and against the EEOC. Despite being the federal respondent to the company’s appeal, the EEOC did not sign on to the government’s (that is, the DOJ’s) Supreme Court brief.

The District Court based its ruling on several grounds, as did the Court of Appeals, so it’s important to understand the reasons put forward by the DOJ for asking the Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision. After all, the DOJ might be calling for the same outcome as the funeral home, but that doesn’t mean they agree on all issues, and they might be advocating the same outcome for differing reasons.

As outlined in the Aug. 16 brief, the following is a rough summary of the DOJ’s arguments:

The meaning of “sex” in the original 1964 Civil Rights act was understood to be biological sex, and Congress has declined to explicitly add transgender status to employment non-discrimination legislation over the years. This means the Court of Appeals was wrong in its claim that federal non-discrimination law does implicitly entail transgender status. Even if discrimination against a transgender person on the basis of being transgender could be regarded as discrimination on the basis of sex, a claimant must prove that he or she was negatively impacted by that discrimination by comparison with a counterpart of the opposite sex. Since discrimination against transgender persons would negatively impact trans men as much as trans women, this would not be the case. If the Supreme Court accepts that merely considering sex amounts to impermissible sex discrimination, without this element of disproportionate harm, then the court would have to invalidate any and all sex-specific policies, including dress codes and sex-specific bathrooms. The argument that discrimination based on transgender status inherently requires impermissible sex stereotyping fails because the basis of that precedent, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, did not involve a declaration that any and all sex stereotyping was impermissible, only that evidence of sex stereotyping could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex discrimination. Furthermore, Stephens hasn’t been able to prove that she was disproportionately negatively impacted by comparison with a member of the opposite sex — that is, that (in the DOJ’s language) a biological woman would have been allowed to dress under the male dress code.

Did the DOJ say what Shareblue claimed it said?

As of Aug. 23, oral arguments had not taken place, but so far at least, the DOJ hasn’t argued that “Christian employers should be allowed to make women wear skirts,” as Shareblue’s headline claimed. In fact, the “religious objection” exemption that the District Court afforded Harris Homes and its owner Rost has not formed part of the DOJ’s arguments.

Shareblue claimed that:

“The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said ‘the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man’ and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work.”

That is not accurate. The DOJ brief mentions the fact that Rost said this, but does not endorse that view. The actual point the DOJ makes about this, which Shareblue omitted, is that the fact Rost would be equally willing to fire both a biological man and biological woman who both refused to dress under the dress code of their assigned gender shows (in the DOJ’s opinion) that the policy does not favor one sex over the other, meaning it is permissible under federal non-discrimination law.

The DOJ has not endorsed or supported Rost’s biblically founded viewpoint on gender or attire, nor his company’s specific dress code policy. Rather, the DOJ has quite narrowly and specifically argued that the policy does not unfairly favor or burden workers of one sex over the other, and so does not violate non-discrimination law.

Shareblue went on to claim:

“You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.”

This is very misleading. Again, the DOJ did not make a religious exemption argument in its Supreme Court brief, and its argument that Harris Homes’ dress code does not unfairly burden one sex over the other is not contingent upon the particular religious faith of the employer. So the conditional statement “as long as a Christian business owner demands it,” is a highly misleading representation of what the DOJ has actually argued.

Is the DOJ arguing that any business owner, regardless of religious faith (or absence thereof) “should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work”? Not exactly, but the DOJ is arguing that this is what the law already allows, under certain conditions.

The DOJ is not making an argument from a moral viewpoint, saying what “should” be allowed and what should not be allowed. As is the norm for briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, the DOJ is arguing what it perceives existing law to require — taking into account the text of legislation, the precedents set in past federal court decisions, as well as the intentions and understandings of lawmakers when they wrote the legislation in question. These are legal arguments, not moral ones, and they are arguments based on what the DOJ understands is the case, not what the DOJ thinks should be the case.

In this particular instance, the DOJ is arguing that the existing body of non-discrimination law does not recognize transgender status as one of the grounds for a “pure” discrimination claim (like race, sex, religion, and so on); and that existing law does not regard a workplace policy as impermissible if it merely takes into account sex, rather than unfairly favoring or burdening one sex over the other.

Therefore, the DOJ is in effect arguing that existing law already allows an employer to impose different dress codes for male and female workers, provided those dress codes don’t unfairly burden or favor one sex over the other. In this narrow sense, Shareblue’s headline has an element of truth — having different dress codes for men and women could involve obliging female employees to wear skirts (or pantsuits, or scarves, or dresses, and so on.)

But that headline is woefully incomplete and therefore misleads readers about the DOJ’s actual argument, because having different dress codes for men and women would equally involve obliging male employees to wear trousers, suits, ties, and so on.

So for Shareblue to cherry-pick only one side of the implications of the DOJ’s argument, by focusing, in its headline, on “women” and “skirts,” misleads readers while also missing the very point the DOJ made in that argument: that once the burden from sex-specific policies like dress codes is equally shared by men and women, the law allows that policy."

"Please stop washing your poultry, USDA warns in new study",https://www.kgun9.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.kgun9.com/news/national/please-stop-washing-your-poultry-usda-warns-in-new-study,"When it comes to chicken cleanliness, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a recommendation: stop washing your poultry.

A study from the USDA shows that people are putting themselves at risk of illness when they rinse or wash raw poultry, the agency said in a press release Monday.

The study conducted by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service was done in partnership with North Carolina State University and examined how home cooks handle raw meat. It also examined how the handling of raw meat can affect the cleanliness of other food nearby.

Here's how it worked: 300 participants prepared chicken and salad in test kitchens. Some of the participants were shown social media messages warning against washing poultry before they prepared their food while another group was not shown the messages.

""The food safety messages in the emails effectively encouraged participants not to wash raw chicken thighs before cooking,"" the study states, with 93 percent of participants heeding the warning they were shown.

Of the control group participants — who were not shown the social media warnings on poultry washing — 61 percent washed their poultry before cooking it.

Among the people who reported washing their poultry when cooking at home, 30 percent said they did it to remove blood and slime while 19 percent said they did it because that's how a family member does it.

It may not seem like a big deal to rinse chicken but it affects the cleanliness of nearby food, the study showed. Among the group of people who washed their poultry, nearly 30 percent of their lettuce used for salads was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This figure was only 20 percent among the people who didn't wash their chicken.

The culprit? Cross-contamination from washing poultry.

""Even when consumers think they are effectively cleaning after washing poultry, this study shows that bacteria can easily spread to other surfaces and foods, "" said Mindy Brashears, the USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety. ""The best practice is not to wash poultry.”

The USDA recommends the following steps to help prevent illness when preparing poultry or meat in the home:
