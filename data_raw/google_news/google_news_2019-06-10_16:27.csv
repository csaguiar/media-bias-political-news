Trump slams NYT story on Mexico pact as a ‘FRAUD’ and ‘hit job’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-nyt-story-on-mexico-pact-as-a-fraud-and-hit-job,"President Trump slammed The New York Times on Monday over an article on the administration’s immigration deal with Mexico that he called a “FRAUD” and a “hit job” -- while also warning that if Mexico's legislature does not approve the pact, he will move anew to impose tariffs.

The president's comments come after the administration on Friday announced a deal with Mexico which would halt Trump's threatened tariffs in exchange for Mexico taking further action to stop the flow of migrants from Central America to the U.S.-Mexico border.

TRUMP RAISES SPECTER OF IMPOSING 'VERY PROFITABLE' NEW TARIFFS ON MEXICO DESPITE DEAL BREAKTHROUGH

According to the joint declaration issued by the State Department, Mexico will take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border.”

But the Times reported that the deal includes a range of actions that Mexico already had promised to take in prior negotiations with the Trump administration over the past several months.

“When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported ‘hit job’ on me, something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick journalism,” Trump tweeted early Monday.

The president seemed to be referring to an article published by the Times on Saturday, which reported that the Mexican government had already pledged to deploy its National Guard to the border in March during talks with former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The Times did, though, say that Mexico's pledge to deploy up to 6,000 national guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala ""was larger than their previous pledge,"" and that Mexico's ""agreement to accelerate the Migrant Protection Protocols could help reduce what Trump calls 'catch and release' of migrants in the United States by giving the country a greater ability to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico.""

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles.”

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" pushed back on The Times report and insisted ""all of it is new,"" including the agreement to dispatch around 6,000 National Guard troops — a move Mexico has described as an ""acceleration.""

""This is the first time we've heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migration, not just at the southern border but also on the transportation routes to the northern border and in coordinated patrols in key areas along our southwest border,"" he said, adding that ""people can disagree with the tactics"" but ""Mexico came to the table with real proposals.""

But even as the president called the agreement “successful,” he suggested he may again seek to impose tariffs on Mexico if the plan falls through.

“We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!” Trump tweeted.

“We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!” he added.

For now, the deal ends plans by the Trump administration to slap a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico -- something that had sparked fears from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the possible economic fallout from such a move, with concerns it could kill off an incoming trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The tariffs were slated to go into effect Monday and continue to increase each month, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1, 2019.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The U.S.-Mexico deal also comes amid an escalating crisis at the border, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection reporting last week that it apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May—levels not seen in over a decade.

Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration at the crisis and repeatedly blamed both congressional Democrats and Mexico for not doing more to protect against the surges of migrants at the southern border.

America is about to be reintroduced to John Dean, the man whose cool, calm and controversial testimony in the Watergate investigation began the public demolition of President Richard Nixon.

As he spoke to the Senate's special investigating committee on June 25, 1973, Dean and his owlish glasses were imprinted on the national consciousness, his appearance carried live on all three TV networks and watched by tens of millions.

Dean had been the White House counsel when he had warned Nixon there was ""a cancer growing on the presidency"" that could prove fatal. Dean's diagnosis was based on his own involvement, and by turning against his boss, he was helping his prognosis come true as well.

Dean will be back on Capitol Hill Monday, called by the House Judiciary Committee, where he briefly worked as junior staffer for the Republican members more than 50 years ago.

That was before he worked for Nixon, and before the scandal that would send Dean to prison and create a lifetime of curious notoriety. Before the 1970s were over, Dean's memoir (Blind Ambition) had spawned a TV miniseries in which Dean was played by a young Martin Sheen.

Dean is being called because the House Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Democrat Jerry Nadler of New York, are looking into the substance of the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — and the actions of President Trump in response to Mueller's investigation.

Some of those actions showed up in Mueller's report as potential instances of obstruction of justice. That category of offense was the focus of Dean's days of testimony under the bright TV lights 46 years ago this month.

Monday's hearing is not part of a formal impeachment proceeding against Trump, and Nadler has complied with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's preference for terms such as ""inquiry."" At least, so far.

Still, it is worth noting that when Dean had his celebrated moment of accusing Nixon in 1973 he was also not testifying before an impeachment proceeding. It was, rather, a committee of the Senate seeking information on ""campaign practices.""

That Senate panel had no power to commence a formal impeachment process (which must begin in the House). But over the course of that long summer, the findings of that panel changed many minds and made impeachment all but inevitable.

For viewers of cable news, Dean should need no reintroduction. Now 80, he has been a regular contributor on CNN and a frequent guest on other news programs as well. (He has been interviewed on NPR several times, most recently on Weekend Edition Sunday on Dec. 2, 2018.)

Dean has been a sharp critic of the Trump administration, calling the president ""worse than Nixon,"" especially with regard to Trump's handling of Mueller.

So Nadler & Company want some of that perspective for their own purposes. And if they also hoped Dean would get the president's goat, they didn't have long to wait. The president tweeted his reaction on Sunday, saying the Democrats wanted a do-over on the Mueller report so badly they ""are even bringing in CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean.""

In January 2018, in one of his CNN appearances, Dean compared the Russian election interference to the burglary at the Watergate office complex in 1972 that began the Watergate scandal. He said presidential efforts to frustrate investigators in both cases could be considered obstruction of justice.

Obstruction was one of the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" alleged in the impeachment articles against Nixon. Obstruction was also a key charge against President Bill Clinton when he was impeached by the House in 1998 (he survived a trial in the Senate early in 1999).

In that same CNN appearance in January 2018, Dean predicted Democrats would win control of the House in the November midterm elections, as they did, and ""start the education process so the people are ready to deal with the very serious issue we have with this president"" – meaning Trump.

Dean noted that, given the Justice Department's official policy against indicting a president, both in the Watergate era and today, the only remedy was impeachment.

Dean's willingness to compare Nixon and Trump, and to link their handling of investigations into their election campaigns, explains why he is expected to prompt live TV coverage again.

As one Fox News host said on Saturday, the Democrats want to have people talking about impeachment, and ""nothing says impeachment like Watergate and nothing says Watergate like John Dean.""

Dean was a key Watergate insider – and whistle blower – due to his special role as White House counsel. That important position has often been an uncomfortable one in the past. The office is filled by the president's choice, but its first responsibility is to the institution of the presidency rather than to the president himself. That has forced difficult choices on quite a few of the lawyers who have held the position over the years.

Dean was one whose choices cost him dearly. Sentenced to serve up to four years, he had his sentenced reduced after testifying against several former White House colleagues. He served only four months before being released.

More recently, White House counsels struggled with their dual responsibilities in the Clinton years. And Trump's first White House counsel, Don McGahn, has been extensively interviewed in the Mueller investigation. The Mueller report indicates Trump tried to involve McGahn in efforts to fire Mueller, efforts that might constitute obstruction of justice.

Nadler's committee has issued a subpoena for McGahn, but he has refused to testify at the direction of the White House and may yet be cited for contempt of Congress. McGahn left the White House in 2018, his departure being announced by the president on Twitter. In a subsequent reference, the President said McGahn was not a ""John Dean type 'RAT.'""

Dean joined the White House in 1970, after graduating from Georgetown Law Center in Washington. Just 32 when he became counsel, he had spent two years at a law firm and four more as a Republican staffer in the House, where he re-encountered an old friend from military school: Barry Goldwater Jr., then a freshman House member from California. Dean had become friendly with the Goldwater family, and traveling in GOP circles led to meeting John Mitchell, a longtime Nixon confidant and his first attorney general, and eventually to the counsel's office in the White House.

Dean was in the job in June of 1972 when five burglars were caught attempting to plant listening devices in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, then located in the Watergate office complex in Washington D.C.

Dean was involved in the cover-up in the months that followed the burglars' arraignment. That included destroying evidence and supervising the payment of ""hush money"" to the burglars as well as misleading outside investigators.

At first, the cover-up seemed successful. Despite the reporting of the legendary team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein at The Washington Post, most of the country was not interested in the Watergate story that fall. Nixon was re-elected that November with 49 states in his column.

But Dean sensed himself in legal peril in the early months of 1973, as the cover-up was fraying on several fronts. There were questions from the trial judge and the Senate Judiciary Committee brought it up in confirmation hearings for the FBI director.

Dean came to suspect he was being set up as the fall guy for the cover-up and conspiracy. He later recalled Nixon saying ""No, no, no John you're the law here...the lawyer doesn't go to jail.""

But Dean was fearful enough that he hired his own lawyer in April and began cooperating with investigators he had been resisting. Later that month, Nixon went on national TV to announce the resignations of two top aides (who would eventually serve time for their own roles in the cover-up) and the firing of Dean.

Soon thereafter, the Senate formed the Select Committee On Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by conservative Democrat Sam Ervin of North Carolina. Despite the name, the panel was soon known as the Watergate Committee and understood to be aimed at the White House.

Dean was known as the star witness of those hearings, although his testimony came at the start of what became a weeks-long ordeal. Another pivotal point came with the revelation that Nixon had recorded all his Oval Office meetings. Investigators wanted those tapes, as did Congress. The legal battle over them would eventually be resolved by the Supreme Court, which ruled without dissent that Nixon had to turn them over. The president resigned less than two weeks later, in the summer of 1974.

Dean by then had pleaded guilty to his own charges and had been sentenced. But by early in 1975 he had served his reduced time and returned to private life. Disbarred as a lawyer, he has since been an investment banker and written a number of books, including on Chief Justice William Rehnquist and President Warren Harding, who hailed from his own hometown of Akron, Ohio.

He has also written condemnations of the administration of President Ronald Reagan (over the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal) and that of President George W. Bush for offenses ""worse than Watergate"" (for lying to Congress to set up the Iraq War).

Dean also published Conservatives Without Conscience (2006), a deliberate reference to the classic Conscience of a Conservative by Barry Goldwater Sr."

The Senate is going to get back to good old-fashioned legislating any day now. Republicans swear it.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s Senate has been almost entirely focused on confirming President Donald Trump’s personnel and judges and has had little in the way of recent legislative victories.

Story Continued Below

“It is frustrating,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a top Democratic target in 2020, said of the Senate standstill. “But we are still working on a number of really good bills.”

The paltry list of accomplishments has given Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer an opening to portray the GOP as devoid of any agenda and could endanger Republicans at risk in a tough election cycle. And there’s a growing recognition within the GOP that it needs to do more.

McConnell and his deputy, Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota, are telling committee chairmen to start approving bills and get them ready for the floor, according to Republican senators. Some lawmakers are optimistic that by August, they will have passed a bill lowering health care costs along with defense policy legislation. Approval of a new North American trade deal this year is also a possibility, as is a bipartisan deal to lift stiff budget caps.

“It will definitely change soon,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who Democrats are eager to challenge next year. “I like policy and legislation. So, that’s my preference. But I certainly understand that due to the obstructionist tactics, regrettably, we had a huge backlog that we had to clear out.”

“Seeing is believing,” Schumer said in an interview. “Did you see what’s on the floor [this] week? More nominations.”

Not a single Republican senator interviewed for this story criticized McConnell, with most blaming Democrats for the slow legislative roll. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said ""Sen. Schumer is the problem, not the solution to the problem.”

But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some private and public grousing in the GOP caucus. Of Schumer’s campaign to tag the Senate as the “legislative graveyard,” one senator said, “He’s got a point.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) wisecracked in an interview that the chamber will turn to legislation “when we’ve run out of nominations to consider.” Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, a vulnerable GOP incumbent running for reelection next year, is leaning on McConnell to schedule more votes.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) recently publicly said Congress has gotten “zilch” done. Shortly after, the Senate took a floor vote on a measure to ban robocalls that probably could have passed by voice vote. GOP leaders, however, were eager to show they were legislating.

“We ought to be less risk-averse. And I don’t think I’m the only one who believes that. I just think I’m just the only one foolish enough to say that,” Kennedy said. “Every time I talk about this, some knucklehead tries to spin it as a criticism of Mitch, and it’s really not.”

Amid the GOP frustration, Democrats sense an opportunity.

Party leaders are eager to get voters focused on Senate races amid a presidential contest sucking up most of the oxygen. So they're attacking McConnell as steward of the “legislative graveyard,” a strategy devised by Schumer and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a member of leadership.

“People don't understand that if the Senate does not become a Democratic majority we will see Sen. McConnell do the same thing, just stopping everything,” Stabenow said. She insisted a Democratic majority would be more open to wide-ranging debates on tough issues.

Schumer “couldn’t hold back our members if he tried,” she said. “Every single one of our members that is a ranking member right now is just chomping at the bit so they can chair a committee.”

It’s always easier to make that case from the minority, just as McConnell did in 2014. While it’s difficult to pass bills in divided government or overcome the chamber’s 60-vote threshold, this Senate’s single-minded focus on nominations is unusual.

Schumer has already shown interest in pushing an aggressive legislative agenda; six years ago, he worked closely with then-Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, attempt to curb gun violence, and pressure Republicans with doomed votes to raise the minimum wage and promote gender pay equity.

McConnell allies highlight that the Senate, under Reid June 2013, had 13 bills signed into law that year, compared with the 20 signed since this session began.

McConnell believes that confirming conservative judges to lifetime seats is the most effective way to make change while Democrats hold the House — doing so requires no bipartisan cooperation and has lasting consequences. He relishes the role of blocking Democratic priorities, dubbing himself the “grim reaper” of progressive legislation as he runs for reelection.

In response to a New York Times article about the Senate's extraordinary focus on nominees, McConnell’s political account tweeted: “I’m Mitch McConnell and I approve this message.”

The Senate’s nominee push has accelerated after Republicans triggered the “nuclear option” in April to slash debate time for lower-level executive and judicial nominees. Republicans argued the change was necessary because of Democratic stall tactics. The rules change has sped up the confirmation process, with the Senate confirming 45 nominees during one 21-day period.

Yet senators still grow restless.

Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) acknowledged the dissatisfaction with the lethargic legislative pace but said, ""There’s not much you can do about it when the Democrats make us take all this time to vote on noncontroversial judges and Cabinet people.”

Others said it's time to switch gears. Gardner said he had encouraged McConnell “to vote on more things, to have more debates.""

“I appreciate the fact that we have to do the personnel side of the business,” Murkowski said. “But as one that wants to get to the policy, I’d like us to be moving on some of these pieces of legislation.”

The Senate has notched a handful of legislative successes. It passed a foreign policy bill that the House has refused to take up, a large public lands package, and, after lengthy delays, bills funding the government and providing disaster relief.

But the Senate has taken just seven votes on amendments this year with no open amendment process, which has become rare under both Democratic and Republican majorities. So even as both parties eye legislation to reduce health care costs and prescription drug prices and raise the tobacco purchasing age, skepticism abounds.

“If they do a bill filled with small health care fixes, all they are doing is stabbing you in a leg with one arm and then putting a tiny band aid on your other arm,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. “If there was an amendment process, that’s a different animal. I just find it hard to believe [that will happen].”

Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who lead the health care committee, are optimistic their legislation to lower health costs will move through committee this month and onto the floor in July. But GOP Senate leaders aren’t making any promises.

“If they can find bipartisan legislation that we think can get 60 [votes] on the floor, we’re ready to go,” Thune said. “You have to keep expectations realistic. This is a time of divided government and the House and Senate are pretty far apart on most of the major issues.”

Schumer has concentrated his attacks on Senate GOP leaders for ignoring the growing pile of bills passed by the Democratic House and abandoning Republicans’ own legislation.

“People want things to get done,” Schumer said. “People are starting to talk all around about the legislative graveyard run by Sen. McConnell.”

Asked about Schumer's messaging campaign, Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), a top Schumer target in 2020, responded: ""OK, whatever.""

“I don’t listen to much of what that Chuck Schumer says,"" she said. “We get to set our agenda.”"

Under an agreement between Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats in the state legislature, low-income adults between the ages of 19 and 25 living in California illegally would be eligible for California’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. The deal emerged as part of a broader $213 billion budget.

The plan would take effect in January 2020, the Sacramento Bee reported.

HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ALONG CALIFORNIA LEVEES MAY BE WEAKENING THEM, OFFICIALS WARN

State officials have estimated the benefits would be available to about 90,000 low-income illegal immigrants at a cost of $98 million per year.

“While it’s not all we sought, it will provide a real tangible difference for people, especially for those around and below poverty and for middle income families who don’t get any help under the federal law,” Anthony Wright, executive director of advocacy group Health Access, said. Indeed, a family of four earning as much as six times the federal poverty level -- or more than $150,000 a year -- would be eligible to get about $100 a month from the government to help pay their monthly health insurance premiums.

To pay for part of it, the state agreed to start taxing people who don’t have health insurance. It’s a revival of the individual-mandate penalty that had been on the books nationwide under former President Barack Obama’s health-care law until Republicans in Congress eliminated it as part of the 2017 overhaul to the tax code.

The budget agreement still must be approved by the full state legislature; a vote is expected this week. State law requires lawmakers to enact a budget by midnight on June 15. If they don’t, lawmakers would lose their pay.

(Blake Sell/Reuters)

The anti-Clinton case then was stronger than the anti-Trump case is now.

There’s been a cottage industry in accusing Republicans of impeachment hypocrisy.

They happily impeached Bill Clinton and now vociferously oppose the impeachment of Donald Trump, even though Clinton was accused of obstruction of justice — just as Trump is now.

Is this a legitimate point?

There are uncomfortable parallels. The Democrats most fervent about impeachment say that it is their duty to do it no matter what, politics be damned. They speculate that perhaps the polling on impeachment will improve once it’s under way. Republicans said the same thing in the 1990s, and the Clinton impeachment ended in a fizzle.

And it’s certainly true that both Clinton and Trump behaved appallingly when under investigation.

Given that the Clinton impeachment, as a practical matter, acted as a censure vote and Clinton’s misconduct didn’t involve his core presidential duties, there’s a good argument that a formal censure would have been the wiser course. In retrospect, Newt Gingrich doesn’t give himself high marks for how he handled it.

That said, the case for Clinton’s impeachment was still stronger than the case for Trump’s.

The independent counsel in the Clinton case, Ken Starr, acting under a law that compelled him to notify Congress of impeachable offenses, said there was “substantial and credible evidence” that Clinton was guilty of eleven possible impeachable offenses. Starr didn’t, like Mueller, exonerate Clinton on the underlying matter and “not exonerate” him on the process crimes.

Most important, Clinton flat-out perjured himself, which no one disputed. If Trump had done the same in the Russia probe, he’d have been impeached already.

In the 1990s, there was bipartisan support for an impeachment inquiry and a strong consensus for punishing the president. Neither exists today.

While it’s easy to think that Clinton was always safe from removal in the Senate, and for the most part he was, there was a moment of legitimate peril for him. Under current conditions, it’s impossible to imagine Trump facing similar jeopardy.

It’s worth recalling all of this, and in what follows, I draw on the book I wrote on the Clinton presidency in 2003 (the original quotes are from my research at the time).

Ken Starr Didn’t Have Much Choice

Starr wasn’t, like Robert Mueller, a special counsel who is supposed to be tightly tethered to the Justice Department. He was an independent counsel who was envisioned under the law as a quasi-independent prosecutor who would serve up impeachment referrals to Congress.

Almost every aspect of the independent-counsel statute was a trespass on the executive branch: Congress required the attorney general to ask for the appointment of independent counsel in certain circumstances; gave to a panel of judges the power to make the appointment; and invested in the independent counsel, once selected, prosecutorial powers with almost no check from the rest of the executive branch.

Foolishly, instead of letting the independent-counsel statute lapse, Bill Clinton signed a renewal in 1993. He thus ensured endless investigations of his administration and, once the Monica Lewinsky affair got caught up in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit against him, a huge step toward his own impeachment.

By the end of 1997, Ken Starr was about to move on to the report-writing phase of the Whitewater investigation, the original cause for his appointment, when his office got word of the Lewinsky matter.

A confidante of Lewinsky’s, Linda Tripp, called Starr’s office with information about Clinton’s efforts to keep the former intern quiet. Her allegations had a thematic connection to the rest of Starr’s work, since they involved attempts to ensure someone’s non-cooperation with a court proceeding by offering job help, a subplot of Whitewater.

When Starr’s deputy Jackie Bennett called deputy attorney general Eric Holder to apprise him of the situation, Holder’s reaction was, “Wha-wha-what?” There was really no option but expanding Starr’s authority to deal with the case. With Newsweek close to publishing an article on the affair, Holder told me, “It was pretty clear to us — there wouldn’t be time to get somebody else in there,” and if the opportunity had been missed to move quickly, “we would’ve been criticized, justifiably.”

Once the essentials of the Lewinsky story became clear —sex with an intern, attempts to get her to lie and win her silence, false statements in sworn testimony — Starr’s path was obvious and nearly inevitable: an investigation leading to an impeachment referral to Congress.

The independent-counsel statute essentially demanded it as a matter of law: An independent counsel, said the statute, “shall advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible information . . . that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.” Creating this automatic pilot toward impeachment was one of the purposes of the misbegotten statute in the first place. It relieved Congress of the political risk of initiating impeachment proceedings itself.

Clinton’s Perjury Was Flagrant and Repeated

There’s no escaping the fact that President Clinton committed crimes in the Lewinsky affair. First and foremost, he perjured himself repeatedly — though his defenders would perform legalistic dances to try to keep the “p-word” from applying to his false statements.

Their chief argument was that his lies about Lewinsky in his deposition in the Jones case were immaterial to the case and therefore not technically perjury. The judge in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case against Clinton, Susan Wright, did ultimately exclude evidence related to Lewinsky from the Jones case, but that was not because it was immaterial. She stipulated at the time that Clinton’s Lewinsky testimony “might be relevant.” Later, she elaborated: “Contrary to numerous assertions, this court did not rule that evidence of the Lewinsky matter was irrelevant or immaterial to the issues in plaintiff’s case.”

Besides materiality, there are two other elements to perjury: falsehood and the intent to deceive. Clinton’s defenders say his testimony was literally truthful by the definition Clinton assigned his words. But witnesses cannot create their own private languages. Their words must be understood by their common meaning, by which standard Clinton’s testimony was clearly false. As for intent, Clinton was open about his desire to deceive. “I misled people,” he said in his August 17, 1998, confession speech to the nation. “I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct.” Imagine every dubious or dishonest thing Trump said during the Mueller investigation being repeated under oath — that was what Clinton did.

When he testified in his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, he lied, most fundamentally, when he denied having sex with Lewinsky. The Jones lawyers offered a definition of sex drawn from the Violence Against Women Act, and Wright pared it down to: “contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an attempt to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.” Even by Clinton’s solipsistic and implausible interpretation of this definition — i.e., that it was possible for Lewinsky to have sex with him while he wasn’t having sex with her — Clinton lied, since it is obvious that he touched Lewinsky in places that qualified as sex under the definition.

He lied when he said he had no memory of being alone with Lewinsky. He lied when he said he didn’t recall giving any gifts to Lewinsky (three weeks earlier, he’d given her a Rockettes blanket, a New York City skyline pin, sunglasses, cherry chocolates, a stuffed animal, and other trinkets). He lied when he said that he talked to Lewinsky about the possibility of her being subpoenaed in the Jones case only once, and that in passing and jokingly. He lied when he said that he didn’t know about Lewinsky’s subpoena in the Jones case when he talked to her for the last time. He lied when he denied that Vernon Jordan kept him updated about Lewinsky’s status in the Jones case.

After the impeachment fight had burned out in April 1999, Wright — the same judge Hillary praises for allegedly totally vindicating Clinton in the Jones suit — sanctioned Clinton for contempt of court. She wrote that there is “simply no escaping the fact” that Clinton gave “intentionally false” answers to questions from the Jones lawyers in a way “designed to obstruct the judicial process.” Even Abbe Lowell, chief investigator for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, had told his fellow Democrats upon first evaluating the evidence, “Perjury in his deposition. No question that he lied.”

Clinton’s testimony before Ken Starr’s grand jury in August, after he had finally decided to admit his affair, was an encore performance of his civil-deposition lies. He lied when he denied having sex with Lewinsky, and he lied when he said their “inappropriate” relationship didn’t begin until 1996. He lied when he said his civil deposition in the Jones case had been truthful. He lied when he denied being alone with Lewinsky. He lied when he said that, when he coached Betty Currie, his personal secretary, with a series of rhetorical questions based on falsehoods, he was merely trying to jog his own memory. He lied when he said he hadn’t told Currie to get back the gifts he had lied about not remembering giving to Lewinsky. And he lied in denying that he had lied to his aides in the wake of the Lewinsky revelations.

In addition to his perjury, Clinton was guilty of obstruction of justice. By suggesting to Lewinsky that she give an affidavit to the Jones lawyers, Clinton couldn’t have been suggesting anything other than that she lie — and deny the relationship — in order to avoid being deposed. That is the only possible interpretation, unless we believe that Clinton was urging Lewinsky to expose the relationship preemptively and launch the near-destruction of his presidency.

It seems almost certain that — although both he and Currie denied it — Clinton sent Betty Currie to pick up from Lewinsky the gifts he had given her, in order to keep this evidence safe from a subpoena.

There was little ambiguity about all of this. It was locked-down and obvious.

A Broad Consensus for Punishment

It’s easy to forget the initial shock upon the revelation of Clinton’s conduct.

Later, by the time the controversy had neared its end, it seemed outlandish to think Clinton could have been forced from office. But that was only an illusion created after the fact. It could have been different — for instance, in August when Democratic senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut condemned Clinton from the Senate floor, along with fellow Democratic senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. “I’m pretty convinced that Clinton was within inches of losing the presidency then,” Lanny Davis, who had left the White House but was assisting in its defense, told me. “Because that could have sent a wave of Democratic senators away from him under the cover of Joe Lieberman and Bob Kerrey. And then he would have been very, very hard pressed to stay in office.”

Instead, Lieberman’s condemnation helped Clinton — it expressed disgust without calling for resignation or impeachment.

Nearly everyone agreed on the need for the House to undertake an impeachment inquiry, though. Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican inquiry plan, and the rest voted for an alternative Democratic plan.

There was a consensus in the country in favor of punishing Clinton. In December 1998, Clinton himself asked to be censured. As one of the Democratic censure resolutions said, Clinton had “egregiously failed” his constitutional oath, “violated the trust of the American people,” and “dishonored the office which they have entrusted to him.” This language echoed Lieberman’s August floor statement, when he said Clinton’s behavior was “disgraceful” and “immoral” and had “profound public consequences” — prompting Clinton to respond, “Basically, I agree with what he said.”

The Republican House in 1998 was not necessarily a lost cause for Clinton. He could perhaps have peeled Republican moderates away from impeachment by making a full confession. The problem was that he couldn’t fully admit to his wrongdoing without making a damning case against himself, i.e., “I’m a confessed perjurer.” So he had to stick with the word games.

Asked in one of 81 written questions by Henry Hyde if he had sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in his Jones deposition, Clinton responded, “I do not recall the precise wording of the oath.” His unresponsiveness and his repetition of his lies in response to the questions —he talked to Currie only “to get as much information as quickly as I could” — helped seal his fate in the House.

It impeached him by 228–206 on an article charging him with perjury before Starr’s grand jury and by 221–212 on an article charging him with obstruction of justice.

Clinton Wasn’t Getting Removed

Of course, the public considered the issue and didn’t want Clinton removed from office. The argument over impeachment might best be framed by two concessions made by advocates on the different sides. On one hand, there was Clinton’s lawyer Charles Ruff. Before the House Judiciary Committee, Ruff explained how Clinton had tried to walk a narrow line. “Reasonable people — and you maybe have reached this conclusion — could determine that he crossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or non-responsive and misleading or evasive was, in fact, false.” Although Ruff would not interpret his concession this way, he was essentially saying that in the course of attempting to deceive the court, Clinton told lies — i.e., he committed perjury.

On the other hand, there was none other than House impeachment manager Congressmsn Lindsey Graham. When asked during the Senate trial if reasonable people could conclude that Clinton shouldn’t be removed from office even if he was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused, Graham said “absolutely.”

The Senate obviously wasn’t going to convict — it requires a two-thirds vote — so even impeachment leader Henry Hyde was briefly considering alternatives. A censure resolution floated by Dianne Feinstein was enticing, with its statement that Clinton’s conduct “is unacceptable for a president of the United States, does demean the office of the president as well as the president himself, and creates disrespect for laws of the land.”

“At one time,” Hyde told me, “I was looking for a way to resolve this.”

We couldn’t walk away from pursuing the president, but it was clear that we would not get the two-thirds vote in the Senate. I had hoped to get the majority anyway, and had a couple of our distinguished, courageous senators remained distinguished and courageous, we would have. I thought, having seen the text of Feinstein’s resolution of condemnation — which was stronger than our bill of impeachment, it was excoriating — I would not have been unhappy if that had been adopted by the Senate.

As it happened, the Senate voted 55–45 to acquit on the perjury count, and 50–50 on the obstruction count. Clinton survived, although the debate over his impeachment was just beginning.

Trump and Macron 'friendship tree' has reportedly died,https://www.cnbc.com,['Elliot Smith'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/trump-and-macron-friendship-tree-has-reportedly-died.html,"The tree gifted by French President Emmanuel Macron to U.S. President Donald Trump has died, according to French media reports Monday.

Trump and Macron planted the oak tree sapling on the White House lawn during Macron's state visit to the U.S. in April 2018, but it went missing shortly afterwards. French Ambassador to the U.S., Gerard Araud, tweeted at the time that the sapling had been put in quarantine to comply with U.S. customs regulations, and would be replanted at a later date.

However, French news agency AFP reported Monday that the tree died in quarantine, citing a French diplomatic source."
VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

ANNUAL 'DAY OF SERVICE' TO OFFER FREE DENTAL CARE FOR VETERANS

Auditors looked at the period 2012 to 2017.



They determined nearly $300 million in home loan origination fees had been collected from 73,000 exempt disabled vets during that time.

Why former Defense Secretary Ash Carter wouldn't work for Trump,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-former-defense-secretary-would-not-work-for-trump/,"While he previously swore he would stay outside of politics, former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says he wouldn't work for President Trump. Carter describes the commander-in-chief and his administration in his new book ""inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon"" as ""offensive, racist and divisive.""

""It's not politics, it's personal conduct,"" Carter said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday. Carter explained that he used to tell officers and soldiers in the military that they ""needed to behave themselves"" and would have fired an officer for acting as the president has.

""It's not just the president, it's the kind of behavior and personal conduct that you see everywhere in Washington today is not the kind of thing we tolerated in the military. I fired people for doing that and subordinates fired people for doing even less,"" Carter said.

Carter, who first began working for the Department of Defense in 1981, said he would not work under Mr. Trump if asked because he ""wouldn't know how to help him."" The Obama-era Defense chief said Mr. Trump appears to not take the advice of his Cabinet secretaries. That lack of concern for expert opinion is exactly what led Carter's successor, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, to step down from the post in December, who cited vast differences in viewpoints with Mr. Trump as a sticking point.

""Your first duty as a Cabinet secretary is to serve the president, to help him...I couldn't take a job knowing that what I know and what I brought to the job, I wouldn't be able to apply to helping him,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Carter said the most urgent threats posed to the United States include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and general terrorism.

""The future is more concerning to me, it's a competitive world,"" he said. ""All five of those are potential opponents are focused on us and we have to deal with all five of them and its a fast-moving world in technology, and so we need to make sure we stay competitive, because being the best, which we are, isn't a birthright, you got to keep earning it.""

He noted, however, that he was ""confident in our plans and capabilities with respect to all five of those today."""
Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittBattle over science roils EPA EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerBattle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."
Meadows predicts DOJ inspector general FISA abuse report will be late due to new developments,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meadows-predicts-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-report-will-be-late-due-to-new-developments,"A top Republican on the House Oversight Committee predicted on Sunday that the highly anticipated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse report from the Justice Department’s inspector general will be released later than expected due to new developments.

On Fox News Rep. Mark Meadows told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo that he is ""not as optimistic now"" after Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June.

Horowitz and his team have been investigating alleged FISA abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI since March 2018. The inquiry includes a focus on the FBI’s handling of the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and its extensive use in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to target former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Barr said in April that Horowitz would be wrapped up “in probably May or June” but an end-of-the-month deadline looks increasingly unlikely.

“Only Michael Horowitz knows the exact time frame of when it’s coming out. Obviously the attorney general indicated that he hoped to see it in June. I’m not as optimistic now,” Meadows said on Sunday. “One of the reasons for that is additional information has been given to the inspector general for them to investigate.”

One significant piece of new potential information could be Steele’s interest in being interviewed by Horowitz’s team. Steele has conditions for an interview, including that the inspector general's team needs to come to London, where he lives and runs his private investigative firm Orbis Business Intelligence, they can only focus on his relationship with the FBI, for whom he was a confidential source, and the U.S. has to get permission from the U.K. government first.

As recently as April it was reported that Steele declined to meet with Horowitz’s team due to concerns about being undermined. Although he has apparently come around to speaking with Horowitz, Steele still appears dead set against meeting with officials connected to Barr’s own investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The fact that the dossier had Democratic funding was not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Meadows stressed that his prediction about Horowitz's inquiry was just his own opinion based on the reports he has seen. “I can tell you Inspector Horowitz obviously hasn't communicated that to my knowledge to anybody on Capitol Hill,” the North Carolina congressman said. “But based on what I'm seeing in terms of additional information being shared with him I think it'll be a while.”"
"Acting DHS secretary praises White House deal with Mexico on immigration, defends Trump's tariff threat",https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-secretary-praises-white-house-deal-with-mexico-on-immigration-defends-trumps-tariff-threat,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday praised the recent deal reached by the United States and Mexico to handle the migration situation along the two countries’ shared border, while downplaying the criticism of President Trump for threatening to impose tariffs on the U.S.’ neighbor.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McAleenan said that while people can disagree with Trump’s tactics, the fact remains that Mexico approached the White House with “real proposals” on how to handle the immigration crisis. “Mexico came to the table with real proposals,” McAleenan said. “We have an agreement that, if they implement, will be effective.”

The agreement — announced late Friday in a tweet by Trump — ended a showdown that business leaders warned would have disastrous economic consequences for both the U.S. and one of its largest trading partners, driving up consumer prices and driving a wedge between the two allies. And it represented a win for members of Trump's own party who had flooded the White House with pleading calls as well as aides who had been eager to convince the president to back down.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“I think, just in general, Republicans understand that tariffs are a tax on American consumers,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said during a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does either. He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly, quite honestly.”

A ""U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the U.S. ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, health care and education"" to those people, the agreement stated.

Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.

Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29.

More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.

“We need to change the asylum standard, so that that front bar, where we assign credible fear, is not so automatic, so that 85-95 percent of people get that, while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of a court proceeding,” McAleenan said. “We need to align that more closely with what might actually be a successful claim.”

Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would ""impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.

After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

Trump said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

The 5 percent tax on all Mexican goods, which would increase every month up to 25 percent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

President Donald Trump spent much of this weekend tweeting that Mexico will take ""strong measures"" against northward migration as a result of Friday's trade deal, and bewailing the ""Corrupt Media"" for underplaying those measures' significance.

But Trump didn't specify any Mexican concessions on immigration, referring vaguely to unnamed ""things we had, or didn’t have."" And the one concession the president did specify (in a Saturday tweet), concerning agricultural trade, did not appear in the joint statement issued Friday.

Story Continued Below

Neither the White House, nor the State Department, nor the Homeland Security Department volunteered any clarification to the president's tweets Sunday, and those agencies, along with the Mexican embassy, did not answer POLITICO's request Sunday for comment.

Trump ""got a public relations victory, but does anybody believe that Central Americans from the Northern Triangle are going to stop walking north tomorrow?"" said John Feeley, a former U.S. ambassador to Panama and current Univision political analyst. “He did next to nothing to address the underlying cause of the problem.”

At best, it appears, Mexico may yield more significant ground in continuing negotiations between the two countries.

In Sunday tweets, the president wrote that ""some things not mentioned in yesterday [sic] press release, one in particular, were agreed upon"" and ""will be announced at the appropriate time."" Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha Bárcena suggested in an interview Sunday with CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that additional agreements could surface beyond what the nations included in the joint statement.

“There are a lot of the details that we discussed during the negotiations and during the conversations that we didn't put in the declaration,” Bárcena said.

But the components of the deal announced Friday largely piggybacked existing commitments.

Two immigration-related measures that attracted some attention were Mexico’s decision to deploy members of its National Guard to stem the northward flow of migrants through its territory and U.S. expansion of its “remain in Mexico” policy, which forces certain non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico pending the resolution of their cases in the U.S.

But both these initiatives were either agreed upon or under discussion before last week's intense negotiations. A provision in the joint statement that calls for the U.S. to assist development efforts in Central America doesn't elaborate any specific administration commitment, and the Friday document made no reference to restoring hundreds of millions in funding to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that Trump ordered cut in March.

Most notably, Mexico did not agree in the document to any “safe third country” asylum pact that would require migrants to seek asylum in Mexico if they first pass through that country.

The Trump administration considers an asylum deal a major priority, and pressed for it in negotiations. The Mexican delegation, however, thought such a pact would be “extremely costly and burdensome for Mexico,” according to a person familiar with the talks. In addition, a “safe third country” agreement would be unlikely to gain approval from the Mexican Senate.

“MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!” President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo

Left without an asylum deal, the U.S. declared unilaterally Friday that it will expand its “remain in Mexico” program across the entire southwest border. Under the program — which has been active since January — certain non-Mexican migrants have been forced to wait in Mexico pending the resolution of their asylum case in the U.S.

The Mexican government said last week that more than 10,000 people have been forced to wait in Mexico under the program, which has been implemented at and between various ports of entry in California, New Mexico and Texas.

A U.S. expansion of “remain in Mexico” was likely with or without Trump’s tariff threat, according to a current DHS official. Increasing the scope of the program — formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols — has been a priority for several weeks.

“If what they got out of this was an agreement to expand MPP, that doesn’t sound like very much to me,” the official said.

While the Mexican government depicts “remain in Mexico” as a unilateral move by the U.S., it has agreed to accept migrants and coordinate transit between countries for humanitarian reasons. Whether a border-wide expansion of the program is viable for either country, though, remains unclear. In recent weeks, DHS officials have scrambled to solve logistical hurdles to a broader implementation. Some of the concerns include a lack of access to court space in remote border areas and limited availability of government lawyers to handle cases.

“There are a lot of challenges to it that I don’t think are going to be surmounted tomorrow,” the DHS official said.

Moreover, the program remains the subject of ongoing litigation. While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allowed it to go into effect temporarily in May, the case is still ongoing, and the program could face more legal opposition as it expands.

Even without a “safe third country” deal, the Trump administration could forge ahead with a similar policy in coming weeks. Trump has weighed the use of a fast-track regulation to block asylum to migrants who pass through another country en route to the U.S. The regulation almost certainly would face court challenges, but could force even more migrants back to Mexico.

Mexico’s decision to deploy troops from its newly formed National Guard to stem the flow of migrants northward has been under discussion for months, but had not been finalized, according to one current and one former DHS official.

“They never committed, but did begin some checkpoints in the interior,” said the former official.

The negotiations last week cemented the Mexican government’s commitment to use troops to deal with illegal immigration, the officials said. However, the idea of deploying security forces to secure Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala was broached months earlier.

Mexican Interior Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero said in late March that the Mexican government would send federal police to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a relatively narrow point in southeastern Mexico where authorities could potentially intercept migrants. The topic also surfaced during a March meeting in Miami with former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, POLITICO confirmed Saturday.

The one concession that Trump specified in his weekend tweets concerned Mexican purchase of U.S. agricultural products. But this was not addressed in the joint agreement put out Friday.

“MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!” the president tweeted Saturday.

Bárcena, the Mexican ambassador to the U.S., said she expects Mexico to increase purchases of U.S. farm products and other manufactured goods now that the president has dropped his threat to impose a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods. But that's simple economics, not the result of any agreement.

“Is trade on agricultural products going to grow?” she said. “Yes, it is going to grow.“

Ken Smith Ramos, a former Mexican official who was the country’s chief trade negotiator on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, called Trump’s tweet “a bit strange,” since under NAFTA there already are no tariffs on nearly all agricultural products between the United States and Mexico.

In addition, because Mexico is a free-market economy, the government is in no position to engineer increased purchases of U.S. farm goods. As in the U.S., purchasing decisions are made individually by private-sector firms.

Mexican officials have little incentive to publicly contradict Trump's claim of increased agricultural sales. ""They're just trying to say anything to come out of the mess,” Smith Ramos said.

The Mexican government could, however, increase demand for one particular U.S. farm product — corn — by as much as $2 billion annually if it were to expand use of ethanol-blend gasoline into Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, where it is currently prohibited, according to Smith Ramos.

Smith Ramos said a technical regulation is already under consideration to make the change and that it would “create a huge market for ethanol” in Mexico.

Trump’s threats to use tariffs to get his way on non-trade issues like immigration may weaken congressional support for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. House Democrats are already balking at key provisions of the USMCA, delaying its consideration in Congress.

Trump, meanwhile, kept open Sunday the possibility of slapping future tariffs on Mexico if there is not a significant drop in Central American migrants trying to enter the United States.

“We can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs,” he wrote on Twitter. “But I don’t believe that will be necessary.”"
The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The People's Climate March in New York City in 2014. Kevin Loria/Business Insider

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

According to police, officers conducted a welfare check at the couple's home in Northwest D.C. on Friday. When they arrived they found a man, identified as 51-year-old Jason Rieff, with a handgun who appeared to fire a self-inflicted shot while they were on the scene. Authorities said they also found an unresponsive adult female identified as 45-year-old Lola Gulomova.

Rieff was pronounced dead after he was rushed to an area hospital. Gulomova has worked in a variety of public servant positions for the U.S. government.

"Daily on Defense: HASC chairman lays down his mark, Republicans cry foul, US-Turkey alliance unwinds over F-35, United Technology and Raytheon join forces",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/house-committee-members-deeply-divided-on-presidents-pentagon-budget-request,"OFF THE MARK: House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is drawing clear battle lines with President Trump’s proposed defense budget and its Republican backers in Congress with his “Chairman’s Mark” of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, released early this morning.

The plan proposed by the House committee controlled by Democrats would trim Trump’s $750 billion request to $733 billion, eliminate funding for low-yield nuclear weapons, bar the use of military construction funds for border barriers, prohibit Trump from pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea or send more prisoners to Guantanamo. Nor would it support a separate Space Force, a top priority for the president.

The plan not only conflicts with the administration’s Pentagon proposal but also the Senate version of the NDAA. That plan, passed with little fanfare by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, enjoyed bipartisan support.

BY THE NUMBERS: Here’s the House FY 2020 proposal:



Department of Defense base: $632.9 billion

Department of Energy base: $22.6 billion

Other defense-related activities: $0.3 billion

Defense topline: $655.9 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $69 billion

Defense topline: $724.9 billion

Authorizations outside of HASC jurisdiction: $8.2 billion

Total defense authorization: $733 billion

For comparison here are the Senate numbers from two weeks ago:



Department of Defense base: $642.5 billion

Department of Energy base: $23.2 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $75.9 billion

Defense topline: $741.5 billion

Other defense: $8.4 billion

Total defense authorization: $750 billion



BORDER RESTRICTIONS: House Democrats, who have been fuming about President’s Trump’s legal use of emergency powers to divert military construction funds for his border wall, want to specifically bar the practice in the future.

The House NDAA includes a blanket prohibition on the use of DoD, military construction or counter-drug funds to build a “wall, fence, or physical barrier” along the southern border. It also specifically denies $7.2 billion in funding that the Trump administration planned to pay back to the construction fund to make up for the money shifted to border barriers this year.

DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE: The ranking member on the committee, former chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, weighed in with his objections, noting the move away from what he called the traditional “broad bipartisan support” the NDAA usually enjoys. “There are a number of provisions in the bill that meet that standard,” he said. “There are others that are troubling.”

What troubles Thornberry:



The $17 billion cut from Trump’s budget, which he says doesn’t provide the 3%-5% in real growth to continue readiness restoration

No Space Force, despite bipartisan support on the committee

A $1.2 billion cut in military personnel funds, which he says will hurt service members and their families

Nuclear weapons restrictions. “In addition to prohibiting the deployment of new low-yield weapons, the Chairman’s Mark weakens our deterrent posture against Russia and China and defers essential safety upgrades,” Thornberry says.

A $2.3 billion shortfall in disaster relief funds for Offutt and Tyndall Air Force bases and Marine Corps bases at Cherry Point Camp Lejeune.

Guantanamo restrictions he argues “will ultimately lead to the transfer of current detainees to the U.S.”

Too many reports. The NDAA imposes 240 new reporting requirements, a 34% increase over last year.

The differences will ultimately have to be hammered out in a conference committee.

Tomorrow, Mac Thornberry will do the Defense Writers Group breakfast at 8 a.m. to present the Republican case for more defense spending and fewer restrictions on the Pentagon.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED? The U.S.-Turkey alliance is being strained to the breaking point over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s insistence that he should be able to buy both U.S. F-35s and Russian S-400 air defenses.

Friday the U.S. restated its position after learning Turkey had sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system. “The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35,” said Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment at Pentagon briefing. “Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system. Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program.”

Lord said Turkey would be disinvited from future program management activities, and she set a deadline of the end of next month for Turkey to capitulate to U.S. demands or be booted from the F-35 program. “If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country,” she said. “Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program. Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources.”

But at the same time, Lord said the U.S. “greatly values,” the “strategic partnership,” with Turkey and is “trying to be respectful,” with the long-time NATO ally. ““None of the steps we are taking are irreversible. If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity,” she said.

‘A MERGER OF EQUALS’: Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp announced Sunday they agreed to an all-stock merger that it called “a merger or equals.”

The combined company, which will be named Raytheon Technologies Corporation, will have approximately $74 billion is 2019 sales, which would make it the second-largest defense and aerospace company in the U.S. after Boeing.

“The transaction will create a premier systems provider with advanced technologies to address rapidly growing segments within aerospace and defense,” said a release from the two companies. More on the merger from the Associated Press here.

‘WE’LL DÉMARCHE THEM’: On Friday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called actions of the Russian navy “unsafe and unprofessional,” and said the U.S. would file a formal protest after a Russian destroyer nearly collided with the U.S. guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville in international waters in the Philippine Sea.

""We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll démarche them,” Shanahan said in a brief exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Navy released video Friday of the encounter showing the Russian warship coming within 50 to 100 feet of the American ship, forcing it to reverse its engine to avoid contact with the Russian vessel.

The Navy’s top admiral, John Richardson, chief of naval operations, also released a statement condemning the Russian actions as “irresponsible and reckless.”

""This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power,” Richardson said. “The U.S. Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate.”

55 SYRIAN HOSPITALS BOMBED: The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization says the Russian-backed air campaign of Syrian leader Bashar Assad against opposition forces in northern Syria has devastated the regions hospital system, causing widespread misery among the civilian population.

“The entire medical system of Northern Hama and Southern Idlib, Syria, is in a state of emergency, with 55 medical facilities shut down after a month of continuous bombing,” said the humanitarian group in a statement. “Since April 28, 25 medical facilities have been bombed, with some hospitals hit by airstrikes on multiple days. “

“In a region of Southern Idlib, only one hospital is left serving a population of over 500,000. The use of phosphorous (incendiary weapons) and barrel bombs in addition to airstrikes has created an apocalyptic landscape for civilians,” the statement continues. “UOSSM staff on the ground in conjunction with local health directorates report 347 civilians have been killed (including at least 75 children), over 1,000 have been injured and 400,000 IDPs displaced by bombardment on civilian areas.”

RECRUITING BY TWITTER: The RAND Corporation is out with a new report that finds while the Army’s @GoArmy’s Twitter feed helps build awareness of Army culture, it’s not so great at convincing young people to join up.

The report, “Social Media and the Army: Implications for Outreach and Recruiting,” analyzes social media and the Army web presence to see if and how potential recruits and others are engaging.

RAND found that GoArmy.com visitors are interested in career information and the site is used more intensively in densely populated areas and in immigrant and ethnic communities.

It called @GoArmy’s Twitter feed “a good source for building awareness of Army culture,” but concluded the platform appears to be less effective at producing recruits.

And it said GoArmy’s Facebook page “has an audience made up of the general public, soldiers, veterans, military families and potential recruits – and has substantial potential for creating a positive image of an Army career for precisely the people who are in a position to influence recruits.”

ARCTIC STRATEGY: The Pentagon has released updated Arctic Strategy in a report sent to Congress last week. The mission statement says the desired end-state for the Arctic is “a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations work cooperatively to address shared challenges.”

The strategy outlines three objectives:



Building Arctic awareness

Enhancing Arctic operations

Strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic

NO CASUATIES IN NIGER BOMBING: A U.S. military vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Niger while on the way to a training exercise Saturday, but the U.S. Africa Command says all of the soldiers inside survived the attack.

“There are no reported U.S. casualties, however, as a precaution, U.S. service members are being evaluated,” AFRICOM said in a statement.

The U.S. troops were riding in a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle when it triggered an improvised explosive device while entering a firing range in the vicinity of Ouallam, Niger.

U.S. forces are in the north-central African country assisting Nigerien troops in their fight against violent extremist groups like Boko Haram.

CADET IDENTIFIED: West Point has identified the cadet killed in last Thursday’s military vehicle accident. ""Cadet Christopher J. Morgan, Class of 2020, died due to injuries sustained from a military vehicle accident in the U.S. Military Academy’s training area,"" the school said in a press release.

Morgan, 22, of West Orange, N.J., was a Law and Legal Studies major and was part of the Army Wrestling Team.

""Cadet Morgan was a valued member of the Corps of Cadets and will be missed by all. The entire community is ensuring that our cadets are being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually,” Superintendent Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Morgan family.”

State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images, FILE

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."

Police said they also found Jason Rieff, 51, Gulomova’s husband, with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the home.

The couple has two children, who were not at home at the time of the incident, which police said occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Friday.

Gulomova had been employed with the Department of Commerce for more than a decade, having taken diplomatic posts in various locations throughout Asia."
Opinion | Don’t Indict Presidents,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/opinion/letters/president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M.

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
"Carter Page says he consulted State Department, FBI, and CIA for years",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/carter-page-says-he-consulted-state-fbi-and-cia-for-years,"Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page said he was a source for several agencies in the U.S. government for years before he became the subject of the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Working as an American consultant with Russia expertise, he told Fox News that over the years he spoke with the State Department, FBI, and the CIA.

""I was asked various questions, not only by State, FBI, et cetera, but also CIA,"" he said on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""I had a long-standing relationship with the CIA going back decades essentially, and I was always very transparent, open.""

Soon after he left the Trump campaign, Page became the subject of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016, which relied on British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia. Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The fact that the dossier had Democratic funding was not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Page was also a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Although Mueller determined Russia meddled in election affairs, he did not accuse Page of coordinating with Russian agents and did not establish criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin.

Page has been heavily critical of the Russia investigation and the media coverage of it, which he claimed was an effort to advance a narrative for impeachment.

""Unfortunately, it was completely spun that as you're correctly alluding to in this fake Mueller report, they just refer to this as oh, he's, you know, colluding, if you will, with these Russian intelligence officers,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm acting as a source, completely helping our government.""

""Oh, by the way, doing it for free,"" Page said, noting that this stands in stark contrast to conservative watchdog Judicial Watch's findings that the FBI made 11 payments to Steele in 2016 and the Democrats' ties to Russian oligarchs.

""So unethical,"" he said."
"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."

FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U.S.-Mexico immigration deal met President Donald Trump’s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U.S. border, but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it.

The deal averts a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods that was due to start on Monday, with Mexico agreeing to rapidly expand a controversial asylum program and deploy security forces to stem the flow of illegal Central American migrants.

“We now have an agreement that we believe is going to fix the immigration issue. And that was extremely important to the president,” Mnuchin told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a G20 finance meeting in Fukuoka, Japan.

Mnuchin, who said he participated in a call with Trump just before the deal was announced, said the president would retain the right to impose tariffs if Mexico did not keep its commitments.

“Our expectation is that Mexico will do what they’ve committed to do and our expectation is that we won’t need to put tariffs in place, but obviously if that’s not the case, the president retains that authority.”"

Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."

Treasury targets Iran's most profitable oil refiners with new sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/treasury-targets-irans-most-profitable-oil-refiners-with-new-sanctions,"The Treasury Department imposed broad sanctions Friday on Iran's petrochemical and refinery industry for contributing funds to the financial arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department recently named a terrorist organization.

The sanctions target Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding group, called the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company, which maintains dozens of companies and subsidiaries.

“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines"" to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed the sanctions on the holding company's 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based marketing firms.

The Treasury charges the petrochemical refiners with providing financial support to Khatam al-Anbiya, the Revolutionary Guard's engineering conglomerate, which the U.S. government refers to as the ""economic arm"" of the group.

“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.

The Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and its group of subsidiaries represent 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production and 50% of Iran’s total petrochemical exports, according to the Treasury Department."
"At Trump’s Agriculture Department, science is being plowed under",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gale A. Buchanan', 'Catherine E. Woteki']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/07/trumps-agriculture-department-science-is-being-plowed-under/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)

Gale A. Buchanan and Catherine E. Woteki are former chief scientists of the Agriculture Department, where they served (2006-2009 and 2010-2017, respectively) as undersecretary for research, education and economics.

For the second year in a row, Trump administration leadership at the Agriculture Department proposed budget cuts and took other steps that hamper agencies within the department that supply the data and science needed to inform farm and food policy.

Whether the actions at the USDA reflect malice or ignorance, the results are the same: Policymakers in Congress and America’s farmers will lack the sound science they need to make decisions about how best to feed the nation, improve the rural economy and bolster U.S. agricultural exports.

As the USDA’s chief scientists from the previous two administrations, we are deeply concerned about the harm being done to scientific integrity at the department. We won’t speculate on the motives of the Trump administration’s leaders at the USDA, but we can say that these proposals came only after objective studies and analyses produced by economists and scientists at the USDA’s Economic Research Service, or ERS, conflicted with Trump administration policies.

For example, analysis by ERS economists on the effects of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act stated, “Farm households with income between the 20th to 80th percentile see a modest reduction in their effective income tax rates, while wealthier households, the top 10 percent and top 1 percent, see the biggest decreases in their rates.”

The attempt to defund the ERS also offers some clues about what type of research the Trump administration seems to dislike. The budget suggested cuts to research into food assistance and nutrition, food safety, and analysis of farm, conservation and trade policy.

Numbers don’t lie, but you can attempt to hide them from Congress and the public, undermine them just enough to cast doubt or make them disappear altogether.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appears to be taking a multipronged approach toward dismantling the science that for years has undergirded policy decisions.

First, Perdue tried the direct approach: simply cutting the ERS budget. That approach failed last year when Congress restored the funds. The administration is trying again with its 2020 budget, proposing to cut $42 million — about 50 percent — from the ERS programs and reduce the number of full-time employees to 160 from 331.

Next, the Perdue-led USDA pushed a policy that required all published research from the department to be labeled “preliminary.” When scientists and economists publish in scientific journals, it is only after rigorous peer review. The “preliminary” label appears designed to undermine the research and strike a blow against evidence-based policymaking.

Finally, late last summer, Perdue shocked many researchers in food and agriculture with his decision to move the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of the Washington area. The USDA sidestepped the usual processes for relocation, such as conducting a search through the government’s General Services Administration, and selected potential homes in North Carolina, Indiana and Kansas City, Mo..

Employees learned earlier this year that after the USDA chooses the relocation site, they would have 120 days to move or quit. Many of the economists that would be affected instead found new jobs at other agencies in the District — creating the sort of brain drain that the administration has seemed intent on prompting with its proposed budget cuts.

Perdue also proposed moving oversight of the ERS to the chief economist in his office. We strongly oppose this move because it makes the unit vulnerable to political pressure.

The agency now reports to the chief scientist — a post that remains unfilled after President Trump’s nominee, Sam Clovis, a conservative radio talk show host and former Iowa campaign aide with no background in science, withdrew from consideration in November 2017. Congress should demand that the Trump administration nominate, as soon as possible, a new, independent chief scientist who can obtain swift and broad, bipartisan support.

Food and agriculture in the United States face perennial challenges from a multitude of sources: pests, diseases, droughts, flooding, brutally competitive markets and trade disputes. It is disheartening to think that the science underpinning these vital contributors to the U.S. economy, and to the health and well-being of every American, is under threat from the very government department overseeing them.

"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source,https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/447394-key-figure-that-mueller-report-linked-to-russia-was-a-state-department,"In a key finding of the Mueller report, Ukrainian businessman Konstantin KilimnikKonstantin KilimnikKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ex-GOP lawmaker says Trump 'illegitimate president,' should be impeached MORE, who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ocasio-Cortez says Manafort, others should be released from solitary confinement MORE, is tied to Russian intelligence.

But hundreds of pages of government documents — which special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSchiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Schiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Key House panel faces pivotal week on Trump MORE possessed since 2018 — describe Kilimnik as a “sensitive” intelligence source for the U.S. State Department who informed on Ukrainian and Russian matters.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENT

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

And former Trump attorney John Dowd made a compelling case that Mueller’s report wrongly portrayed a phone message he left for a witness.

VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

"More Than 100,000 Americans Urge EPA To Restrict Unnecessary Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller on Oats",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/more-100000-americans-urge-epa-restrict-unnecessary-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-oats,"WASHINGTON – This week, more than 100,000 Americans officially joined EWG and 20 companies calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly restrict the use of Monsanto’s weedkiller glyphosate on oats as a pre-harvest drying agent.

A coalition of companies and public interest groups, led by EWG and Megafood, gathered 104,952 signatures on online petitions to the EPA, urging the agency to lower the tolerance limit of glyphosate in oats and prohibit its pre-harvest use. The names of those who signed the petitions were submitted to EPA on Wednesday.

The EPA’s legal limit for glyphosate residues on oats is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, first filed last September, asks the agency to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

“Administrator Andrew Wheeler and the EPA could quickly remove one of the more concerning routes of dietary exposure to glyphosate for children by restricting the unnecessary use of glyphosate on oats,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil. “Americans are demanding the agency act to protect the public and the food supply from being contaminated with this toxic weedkiller linked to cancer.”

“It’s hard to find 100,000 people who agree on anything,” O’Neil said. “But when it comes to feeding themselves and their families, they agree that we should not have to worry whether eating healthy, oat-based foods for breakfast could come with a dose of glyphosate.”

The petition was amended this week and submitted to the EPA docket to include additional companies that have signed on since last year.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most widely used pesticide in the world. It is largely used as a weedkiller on genetically modified corn and soybeans. But it is increasingly being used for crop management and applied pre-harvest to a number of non-genetically engineered crops, including oats.

Glyphosate kills the crop, drying it out so it can be harvested sooner than if the plant were allowed to die naturally. This is very likely one of the leading sources of dietary exposure for people who consume foods made with oat-based foods, like cereal and oatmeal.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG scientists consider protective for children’s health with an adequate margin of safety.

On June 12, EWG will release results of its latest tests, which will include additional oat-based cereals and other foods that were not analyzed for glyphosate in the two earlier rounds.

A 2017 study by a team of California scientists estimate that between 2014 and 2016, at least 70 percent of American adults surveyed had detectable levels of the cancer-causing weedkiller in their bodies. That compares to 12 percent in American adults between 1993 and 1996, just before the use of glyphosate started to surge with the advent of GMO crops designed to withstand direct application of the chemical.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

These companies are cosigners of the petition to the EPA: MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farm, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions, PCC Community Markets, Foodstirs and Kamut International, Ltd.

""These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,"" Reagan said in a speech on the 40th anniversary.

Reagan’s predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, actually was the first U.S. president to visit the site, in 1978, but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Many presidents since Reagan have continued the tradition of visiting on the anniversary, an act of remembrance for the lives lost that day and to celebrate their contribution to the ultimate victory of the allied forces.

Ten years after Reagan’s visit marking the 40th anniversary, President Bill Clinton also made the pilgrimage.

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times. She Attended California State University.']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2019/06/05/us-commerce-department-offers-solution-for-obtaining-minerals-critical-to-the-military/,"A report by the U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government strengthen relations with foreign companies that provide minerals critical to military development.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."

"Bruce Ohr, DOJ official, received nearly $43K in bonuses, raise in midst of Russia probe: Report",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Jeff Mordock']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/7/bruce-ohr-doj-official-received-nearly-43k-bonuses/,"The Justice Department official who was demoted for serving as the conduit between the FBI and ex-British spy Christopher Steele received nearly $43,000 in taxpayer-funded performance bonuses during the early stages of the Russia investigation, according to documents released Friday.

The official, Bruce Ohr, also received a $2,600 salary increase after his demotion, the records revealed.

Government watchdog group Judicial Watch released the employment documents that it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” said Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president.

According to the documents, Mr. Ohr was awarded a $14,250 bonus in November 2015, which doubled to $28,000 in November 2016. Less than a year later, he was removed from his position as associate attorney general and later transferred again.

At the time of his demotion, Mr. Ohr was the fourth-ranking official at the Justice Department. His wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS, the opposition-research firm tapped by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele to author the salacious and unverified dossier that helped spark the Russia investigation.

Mr. Ohr remains an active Justice Department employee, a move that has been questioned by Mr. Trump and his allies.

“How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful! Witch Hunt!” Mr. Trump tweeted last year.

Judicial Watch says it has five current lawsuits seeking information about Mr. Ohr.

Watchdog will get an outside review after flawed FEMA disaster response reports,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-will-get-an-outside-review-after-flawed-disaster-response-reports/2019/06/07/ebca0b2a-8922-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html,"Leslie Andermann Gallagher surveys the flood damage to her home on Aug. 17, 2016, in Sorrento, La. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

[Read the inspector general’s internal review of the oversight missteps here]

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."

In 2001 the EPA declared the South Strafford property a Superfund site, citing the acid- and metal-contaminated water that had been leaching from waste rock and tailings into streams feeding the west branch of the Ompompanoosuc River.

The 150-year-old copper mine closed in 1958.

The Valley News reports the EPA has spent almost $90 million to contain the contamination that was leaking from the mine.

The EPA estimates that the amount of copper flowing into the Ompompanoosuc has fallen 99%, while the concentration of iron dropped 95%.

The river has been removed from the list of Vermont waterways too ""impaired"" to support aquatic life.

V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women,https://cleantechnica.com,['Tina Casey'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/06/us-energy-dept-looking-for-a-few-good-clean-energy-women/,"US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women

June 6th, 2019 by Tina Casey

Just in time for the latest wave of fetal fetishism to sweep across the US, the Department of Energy has embarked on a renewed push to recruit more women into the clean energy field. That’s going to be a little tricky considering the complications that arise for working women when lawmakers insert the cold, probing eye of unscientific public oversight into personal decisions on ubiquitous matters of health care (well, ubiquitous for women of birthing years). Nevertheless, let’s take a look and see what’s going on here.

What is the Clean Energy Education & Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program?

The Department of Energy is already proactive when it comes to recruiting women into the clean energy profession.

But, what do they mean by clean energy? Good question!

One key program that is C3E, the Clean Energy Education and Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program.

C3E comes under the umbrella of the International Energy Agency, and the key word here is clean. With that in mind don’t confuse IEA with IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. IRENA is for renewables. IEA is all of the above.

If IEA is pitching a “clean” energy initiative, that’s going to cover a lot of ground including natural gas, nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency.

As the picture comes into sharper focus, consider that the Energy Department first launched C3E during the Obama administration under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Chu.

The collaborative effort is now multinational in scope. The Energy Department has a leadership position at C3E, where it shepherds a smallish but interesting mix of participants amongst the fields of female recruiting. So far the members include Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, and Sweden. And the US.

Yes, all 10 of these countries have women in them. That’s interesting, right?

They also represent almost one-third of the 31 members of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

That’s even more interesting! NEA concerns itself with issues of uranium supply and waste disposal, to name a few.

In the latest development involving the Energy Department’s support for C3E, a Senior Advisor from the agency’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been tapped for the position of Vice Chair at C3E.

There, fixed it for you. As far as the Energy Department is concerned, nuclear energy is clean energy.

Not All Clean Energy Is All That Clean

Setting aside that little thing about risks and hazards (Fukushima, much?), the nuclear energy field is a fascinating one from a science and technology perspective.

With deep roots in the history of both energy and warfare in the US, the nuclear field is all but guaranteed to maintain a favored position in US energy policy, which translates into job security for those who choose to invest in such a career.

That circles back around to the female recruitment issue. The energy field is one among many sectors competing in the rough-and-tumble race to attract top talent from around the world, which explains the drive for gender diversity as well as diversity in general. If the nuclear industry is going to survive, it’s going to need to attract top female talent.

That’s a tough row to hoe. The burgeoning wind energy and solar energy fields are competing for talent, too, and without the extra baggage of waste disposal and high-impact accidents that burden the nuclear field.

Nevertheless, it’s do or die. Take the US fossil fuel industry, for example. Researchers are beginning to note a collision course between the up-and-coming diversified workforce of tomorrow, and the tsunami of retirements as the existing male-dominated workforce ages out.

In other words, it’s a double whammy for coal, oil and gas: renewables are beating out fossil fuel for a share of the power generation sector, and they’re also nailing down the next generation of innovators, too.

The nuclear energy field could find itself facing a lethal brain drain as well.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.

Meanwhile, CleanTechnica reached out to IEA for some insights into the Energy Department’s recruitment efforts and they referred us to the Energy Department, so stay tuned for more on that.

Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
