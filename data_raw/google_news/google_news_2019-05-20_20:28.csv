Amash faces fresh GOP primary challenge after Trump impeachment comments,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/amash-now-facing-gop-primary-challenge-after-trump-impeachment-comments,"Less than 48 hours after GOP Rep. Justin Amash declared that President Trump ""engaged in impeachable conduct,"" a fellow Republican has vowed to challenge him in the upcoming primary election.

Michigan state Rep. Jim Lower made his intentions known Monday morning, announcing that instead of seeking a third term in the state legislature, he will run against Amash for their party's nomination for the 2020 election. Amash has served as the representative for Michigan's Third District since 2011.

CALL FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DRAWS EQUAL PARTS PRAISE AND DISDAIN

""Congressman Justin Amash tweets yesterday calling for President Trump’s impeachment show how out of touch he is with the truth and how out of touch he is with people he represents,"" Lower said, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Fox News has reached out to both Lower and Amash's offices for comment.

Lower, who described himself as ""pro-Trump,"" said he was already planning to challenge Amash, and was originally going to declare his candidacy on July 4. Amash's tweets against the president on Saturday inspired Lower to make the announcement sooner, he said. Lower accused Amash of siding with left-wing Democrats against Trump.

""Amash has not only failed to support President Trump as the President works to make the United States stronger and safer, he has now united with radical liberals like Democratic Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib to try and bring down our President,"" he said, as reported by WWMT. ""He must be replaced and I am going to do it.""

REP. MARK WALKER: JUSTIN AMASH IS AS MUCH A REPUBLICAN AS BERNIE SANDERS IS AN INDEPENDENT

Amash faced criticism from high-profile Republicans following his claim that Trump obstructed justice with regard to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Amash tweeted his statements on Saturday after reading a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. “Contrary to [Attorney General William] Barr’s portrayal, Mueller’s report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meet the threshold for impeachment,” Amash wrote.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed that Amash simply ""wants to have attention."""
Google Restricts Huawei’s Access to Android After Trump Order,https://www.nytimes.com,['Adam Satariano'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/technology/google-android-huawei.html,"President Trump last week issued a ban prohibiting American telecommunications firms from installing foreign-made equipment that could threaten national security. The order instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to stop transactions “posing an unacceptable risk.” Although the order did not single out specific companies, it was widely believed to be directed at Huawei and others in China’s tech sector.

On the same day, the Commerce Department added Huawei to a list of companies deemed to be national security risks, effectively preventing it from buying or licensing American parts and technology without special permission from Washington.

Since then, chip makers, including the German supplier Infineon, have said they would restrict their business dealings with Huawei. “In any market where Infineon operates, we fully comply with all applicable legal requirements, laws and regulations,” the company said in a statement.

Intel and Qualcomm, two of the world’s largest makers of chips, have also told employees to cease working with Huawei until further notice, according to Bloomberg. Intel declined to comment, and Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment.

On Monday, shares in Qualcomm and Infineon were trading about 5 percent lower; Intel was down more than 1 percent. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent, were down about 1.6 percent.

China has not said whether it plans to retaliate against the United States in response to Mr. Trump’s move. Investors sent shares of Apple down more than 3 percent in trading on Monday amid concerns that the company’s dependence on China to manufacture and sell iPhones made it a potential target.

The American campaign against Huawei coincides with preparations by countries around the world to build the next-generation wireless networks known as 5G. The new networks are expected not only to bring faster cellular service, but also to connect new devices like medical tools, industrial equipment and autonomous cars to the internet."

President Donald Trump lashed out at The New York Times on Monday, disputing the paper’s reporting on his relationship with Deutsche Bank and launching into a broader criticism of the news media.

The president appeared to be responding to a Times report that anti-money laundering experts at the German bank noticed suspicious activity in accounts belonging to Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in 2016 and 2017. According to the Times, bank executives blocked employees from reporting the suspect transactions to the U.S. Treasury and one former employee says she was fired for raising concerns about the bank’s scrutiny of certain clients.

Story Continued Below

In a string of tweets Monday, the president pushed back on the paper’s characterization of his relationship with the German lender, which has given Trump's and Kushner’s companies billions of dollars over the years, showing a willingness to work with Trump despite his rocky financial history in the 1980s and ’90s.

“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me,” Trump wrote, kicking off a flurry of posts. “WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money. Very old fashioned, but true. When you don’t need or want money, you don’t need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money.”

Trump also appeared to criticize reporting from a year ago that cast suspicion on his transition over the past decade or so to using cash for real estate purchases, a break with industry norms.

“Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash, he doesn’t need banks,” he claimed in a subsequent tweet, before offering praise for Deutsche Bank’s service. “But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia? No, I built a great business and don’t need banks, but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn’t like them, I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money.”

“Fake Media only says this to disparage,” Trump claimed, railing against the media's reliance on unnamed sources even though members of his own administration routinely request not to be quoted by name.

David Enrich, who authored the Times story, pushed back on Trump’s denial.

“This is not true. I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US,” he wrote in a tweet.

A spokeswoman for the Times said Monday that the paper stands by its story.

Trump’s history with Deutsche Bank has become a renewed focus as Democrats in Congress battle the White House for the release of his financial records and tax returns. Last month, Trump and his family sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block them from turning over those records in response to congressional subpoenas.

On Monday, Trump turned his ire on news outlets who have churned out damaging stories about the president, proclaiming that “the Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today.” He reiterated his claim that the press and congressional Democrats were ignoring the “REAL Russia Hoax,” which he claimed were “all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation.”"
He’s One of the Biggest Backers of Trump’s Push to Protect American Steel. And He’s Canadian.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Eric Lipton'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/us/politics/hes-one-of-the-biggest-backers-of-trumps-push-to-protect-american-steel-and-hes-canadian.html,"The International Trade Administration, a part of the Commerce Department overseen by Mr. Kaplan, the former Zekelman lawyer and lobbyist, sided with Zekelman, recommending that Borusan’s request be denied, documents show. A spokeswoman said Mr. Kaplan had honored all ethics requirements, which would prohibit him from helping a recent client.

Mr. Trump announced last summer that he would double tariffs on steel from Turkey to 50 percent. Those imports — including steel tube — dropped 48 percent last year as a result, a drop so big that Mr. Trump moved last week to return the tariff to 25 percent.

Mr. Zekelman said he played no role in asking for the temporary doubling of the tariff on Turkey, but each of these moves helped his business. The company is also making structural steel pipe for use in the parts of the border wall Mr. Trump intends to build with emergency government funds.

On Friday, the administration reached a deal to eliminate the 25 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada and Mexico, while leaving them in place for most of the rest of the world. The decision will benefit Mr. Zekelman, whose biggest manufacturing plant is in Harrow, Ontario, meaning the company will now be able to ship Canadian-made pipe into the United States tariff free, even as Mr. Zekelman advocates protection for his United States plants.

The success of his tactics has not gone unnoticed by competitors. The American-Turkish Council, whose sponsors include Borusan Mannesmann, moved its annual meeting from the Ritz-Carlton hotel to the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Among the guests at the event last month were Mr. Ross, the commerce secretary.

“What else are you going to do?” said Ms. Mendoza, the lawyer who has represented Borusan. “Everybody is trying to play the game.”"

Bob Best enthusiastically supports President Trump's tough policies against China and other countries.

""I'm not a big tariff guy. I'm a free trade guy,"" says Best, who manages a heating and air conditioning company in Kennesaw, Ga.

""But sometimes when the bully just doesn't listen, you've got to punch him in the mouth. And that's what he's doing.""

Best supports the president's actions even though they affect him directly. The price of the heating and air conditioning units that his company sells went up by as much as $150 apiece after the cost of building them went up because Trump placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last year. He had to pass the increase on to his customers.

Trump will have to appeal to Americans' national pride, and even their patriotism, to succeed in leveling the playing field with China. That's because virtually every American is likely to feel an impact if Trump's tariffs go forward on just about everything imported from China. He will have to persuade Americans that what's at stake transcends their own interests.

Americans may not like paying higher prices on imported products, but they are more likely to tolerate them if they perceive that American values are at stake, says Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

""I think you have an element of patriotism,"" Olsen says. ""People recognize that the Chinese government is not a free government, it's not a democratic government, and that it's increasingly becoming a threat to us and the other countries that do believe in those things.""

As an abstract idea, Americans are big backers of trade. Seventy-four percent see trade as a net positive for the economy. Mohamed Younis, editor-in-chief at Gallup News, says most people believe trade lowers prices overall and leads to a greater selection of products.

But 62% of Americans believe trade with China is unfair, he says.

Last week, Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products from 10% to 25% and has threatened to levy that amount on an additional $325 billion worth of goods.

Tariffs are like taxes paid by importers at U.S. ports when they clear customs. Those businesses have to either swallow the cost themselves or pass it on to customers. The risk for Trump is that Americans will balk at paying higher prices. So far, there's little evidence that's happening.

And support from some of the hardest hit remains firm. Even farmers, who have borne the brunt from the trade war, continue to support Trump in large numbers, says Rhonda Brooks, editor of Farm Journal, which regularly surveys ranchers and farmers about their political views.

""They believe very strongly that this is a president who is — more than any president in recent history, actually — who's really been talking about farmers and at least acknowledging them and that he wants to help them,"" Brooks says."

Donald Trump’s aides and allies are moving aggressively to shore up his support in three Rust Belt states that propelled him to the presidency — but where his own polling shows him in trouble heading into 2020.

Trump will travel to Pennsylvania Monday for a rally that comes after recent visits to Wisconsin and Michigan, two other states at the center of his reelection strategy. Those appearances are just the most public display of his team’s efforts to fortify his standing.

Story Continued Below

Behind the scenes, they've rushed to the aid of languishing state Republican Party machines and have raised concerns that a potential GOP Senate candidate in Michigan could hurt the president’s prospects there. They are also scrutinizing the map for opportunities to fire up his base in the trio of states.

The moves come at a time of growing anxiety over the geographic linchpin of his 2020 hopes. The Trump campaign recently completed a 17-state polling project that concluded the president trails Joe Biden in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, according to two people briefed on the results. America First Action, the principal pro-Trump super PAC, is expected to conduct its own polling and focus groups in Pennsylvania and Michigan later this summer.

People close to the president insist they’re not panicked. They think Biden’s numbers will drop once the honeymoon stage of his campaign wears off. Earlier this month, the president convened his top advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Jared Kushner for a dinner focused on 2020 that was described as an upbeat affair.

Yet there’s nagging concern after a midterm election in which Republicans across the Midwest got clobbered — and as Trump’s trade war is threatening farmers and factory workers who helped put him in office.

The president won each state by less than 1 percentage point in 2016.

“The fact that the president and vice president are frequent travelers to Michigan — I think that shows that everyone gets the math,” said former Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Trump supporter who recently joined the president for a rally in Grand Rapids. “Do the math: You’ve got to carry a state like a Michigan, a Wisconsin, a Pennsylvania.”

Wisconsin is also getting special attention from the campaign.

Former Trump White House chief of staff and ex-state GOP Chairman Reince Priebus was among those who pushed for a post-midterm study to assess what went wrong for the GOP. It resulted in a scalding, 15-page autopsy concluding that the Wisconsin Republican Party had “drifted from its roots as a grassroots organization and became a top-down bureaucracy, disconnected from local activists, recklessly reliant on outside consultants and took for granted money that was raised to keep the party functioning properly.”

To fix the financial woes, the report said, “we need to understand the missteps fully and put a ﬂag in the ground to say ‘this ends now.’”

Released last week, the autopsy followed a brutal midterm election that saw Republicans lose the governorship, traditionally a key organizational and financial asset in presidential elections. The report detailed a series of steps the state party needs to take ahead of 2020.

Priebus, who still speaks with the president, is expected to brief major contributors on the report next month in Milwaukee. Efforts are already underway to pay off the party’s post-midterm debt: Republican megadonor Diane Hendricks, a Trump 2016 fundraising committee vice chair, recently gave the state party $500,000, two people familiar with the donation confirmed.

“At its core, we did the autopsy because 2018 didn’t go the way we wanted it to go,” said Wisconsin GOP Chairman Andrew Hitt, an attorney for Trump’s 2016 campaign. “It really became clear that some things just fundamentally didn’t go right and so we wanted take a deep dive and look at them and correct them.”

Republicans also lost the governorship in Michigan last year. Afterward, the reelection campaign took the unusual step of intervening in the race for state GOP chair, with Parscale issuing a public endorsement of former state legislator Laura Cox. This spring, Michael Ambrosini, a former Trump White House aide and ex-RNC official, took the No. 2 post at the state party.

Trump advisers, meanwhile, are on alert for anything else that might diminish the president’s prospects in the state — including, they worry, a Senate bid by Iraq War veteran John James.

Republican Senate leaders are aggressively courting the rising GOP star to challenge Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. But Trump aides have warned Senate GOP officials that a statewide campaign by James could force Democrats to spend more money in the state, driving turnout on the other side and potentially hurting the president. The Trump team has argued it would be safer for James to run for a House seat.

James has met with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks to discuss his options.

In Pennsylvania, where Republicans have been mired in turmoil and infighting since the midterms, Trump campaign officials traveled to the state capital last month to discuss turnout and field plans with state party leaders.

The Trump team deliberately chose Pennsylvania’s Lycoming County for Monday’s rally, where the president will campaign with a Republican heavily favored to win a special House election this week. Trump won nearly 70 percent of the vote there in 2016, and his advisers hope to mobilize his hardcore supporters well ahead of the general election season.

Pence has embarked on his own foray into the Rust Belt, flying to Michigan in April and doing a multistop tour in Wisconsin last week. He’s slated to headline a fundraiser for the Pennsylvania GOP in Hershey next month.

Pence, the former Indiana governor, is focusing on trade during his travels, visiting manufacturing plants and farms. He has reported back to the president on concerns he’s heard from workers about tariffs.

Despite the concern about Trump’s Rust Belt standing, his supporters insist the president’s appeal to blue-collar workers remains strong.

Lou Barletta, a former Pennsylvania congressman who’s expected to attend the Monday rally, argued that polling understates the president’s popularity — just as it did in 2016.

“If people haven’t learned anything from the last election,” said Barletta, “they’re going to get burned again.”

DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the future health risks of air pollution, a shift that would predict thousands of fewer deaths and would help justify the planned rollback of a key climate change measure, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The proposed change would dramatically reduce the 1,400 additional premature deaths per year that the E.P.A. had initially forecast as a result of eliminating the old climate change regulation — the Clean Power Plan, which was President Barack Obama’s signature climate change measure. It would also make it easier for the administration to defend its replacement, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule.

It has been a constant struggle for the E.P.A. to demonstrate, as it is normally expected to do, that society will see more benefits than costs from major regulatory changes. This is one of many examples of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations.

The new modeling method, which experts said has never been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. But the proposed change is unusual because it relies on unfounded medical assumptions and discards more than a decade of peer-reviewed E.P.A. methods for understanding the health hazards linked to the fine particulate matter produced by burning fossil fuels."

"Acting DHS chief says U.S. won't send migrants to Florida, insists he didn't threaten to quit",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kathryn Watson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mcaleenan-acting-dhs-chief-tells-face-the-nation-the-trump-administration-wont-send-migrants-to-florida/,"The Trump administration will not send immigrants who cross the southern border to Florida, a reversal that was decided over the weekend, acting Department of Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

McAleenan's comments come after Florida officials said they were told earlier last week that federal officials were sending immigrants to South Florida jurisdictions. McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" that ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection did notify officials locally in those areas that they were looking at the possibility of doing that,"" but the CBP acting commissioner decided against doing so Saturday.

News of the plans drew criticism from elected officials in Florida, including Ron DeSantis, the state's Republican governor, who said Friday the state ""cannot accommodate in Florida this dumping of unlawful migrants."" DeSantis confirmed in a Tweet Sunday that he has spoken with Mr. Trump, and migrants won't be heading to his state.

""President @realDonaldTrump and I spoke yesterday and confirmed that he did not approve, nor would approve, sending immigrants who illegally cross the border, to Florida. It is not going to happen,"" DeSantis tweeted.

McAleenan insisted the administration is focused on using southwest border areas to handle the influx of immigrants. He also claimed the administration isn't moving immigrants to sanctuary jurisdictions, as President Trump has said he wants to do. McAleenan claimed sanctuary cities are already housing many immigrants because those cities serve as a ""magnet.""

McAleenan also insisted he never threatened to quit, denying a Washington Post report that he threatened to leave amid a dispute with top Trump adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller, who was reportedly pushing for another shakeup at the agency.

McAleenan, who is also the head of CBP, took over as acting DHS secretary after former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April.

Last week, Mr. Trump announced a proposal to reform legal immigration by restricting some family-based migration and instituting higher skill and education requirements. The proposal would overhaul the family-based migration system Mr. Trump calls ""chain migration."" But the proposal was light on specifics, and the administration has given no timeline for when the proposal might be released in the form of a bill.

""Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker. It's just common sense,"" the president told supporters and reporters in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday."
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."

They were white and male and every one of them came to office with experience in the government, military or both. Barack Obama, the first African American president, broke one mold. Donald Trump, who had neither military nor government experience, broke the other.

In their own ways, Obama and Trump were two of the most unlikely people ever elected to the presidency, raising the question of whether voters in America are using a new lens through which to judge the qualities and qualifications of presidential aspirants. Trump’s presidency continues that experiment, as does the competition among the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to oppose him in 2020.

“Having that celebrity personality and projecting an image in the media is more important than traditional qualifications,” he said. “It’s made me think differently about what it takes to be elected president. The traditional path of being a state governor or U.S. senator doesn’t seem to count as much. It’s being able to manage your image in the media and galvanizing your base.”

Will and Wendy Keen were in the audience at the Big Grove Brewery and Taproom in Iowa City a few weeks ago, awaiting the arrival of former vice president Joe Biden. They have been making what Will called “a diligent effort to connect with each of the candidates” campaigning in their state.

One person who has caught their eye is South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a candidate who, at age 37 and the leader of a relatively small city, might not have been seen in years past as having the experience needed for the presidency.

“The recent reality,” Will Keen said, “has taught us that our vision of what a president looks like, talks like, acts like, has been dramatically changed.” The elections of Obama and Trump, he said, have caused people “to be open to things you might not have expected.”

Many factors have contributed to this change, among them the diversification of the nation’s population; the effect of a nominating system that puts personal ambition and direct communication skills above credentialing by party leaders; the evolution of the role of traditional media and more recently social media; and especially the deepening disillusionment on the part of many Americans with traditional politics and politicians in Washington.

From George Washington through George W. Bush, no characteristic was more enduring in American presidents than the monopoly of white men. No women or candidates of color made much of a dent on the presidential selection process. Candidates of color ran for their parties’ nomination and lost. Women ran for the nomination and lost. Women were nominated to be vice president with no success. In 2016, Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic nomination, the first woman to do so in a major party, and she, too, lost.

Obama, the son of a white mother and black African father, possessed few of the traditional qualifications of previous presidents, among them experience on the national stage. He had served in the U.S. Senate only since 2005 when he was elected president. His election not only broke the racial barrier but also helped open the process to reflect a changing America.

“If you look at what people historically have considered to be acceptable characteristics of their presidents, in terms of ­social characteristics — white, male, married, Christians, neither too young nor too old — those categories have all been shattered,” said Michael Nelson, a political scientist who teaches at Rhodes College. “Not that we’ve elected a woman, but a woman has made it to the finals. The same might be true of sexual orientation.”

Erin Hamilton of Fort Riley, Kan., said she warmed to Trump after her first choice in 2016, Ted Cruz, failed to win the nomination. “I liked that he was not typical, that he didn’t have a whole bunch of political background, that he just did this because he wanted to. . . . I would like to see more people running for the president who maybe don’t have a strong political background.”

Rob Burns, who works in the university bookstore at the University of Iowa, said he is less concerned about traditional credentials as he assesses presidential candidates this year.

“Character is the biggest thing,” he said. “I think if you look back at our best presidents, it’s always their character. It’s not their politics.”

Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, said cultural changes in the makeup of the country have reshaped the political makeup of the parties.

“Presidential prototypes are going to be different as a result,” he wrote in an email.

That’s one reason, perhaps, why there are now 23 candidates for the Democratic nomination, including six women and six candidates of color — diversity unheard of in past elections. They range from Biden, the candidate with the longest résumé, to sitting senators to governors or ex-governors to a big group of current or former House members to a mayor of a small city, a big city or the nation’s largest city, to an entrepreneur to a spiritual activist and author.

Out of this field could emerge the oldest person ever elected as president, or the youngest. It could produce the first female president, the first woman of color as president, the first Latino president, the first Asian American president, the first openly gay president, the first mayor to ascend directly to the White House.

Hetherington believes that a changing Democratic Party makes nontraditional candidates more attractive to some party activists. As consumers, he said, many of those Democrats are more likely to be attracted to niche products — fair-trade coffee as opposed to the opposite, for example — and that helps to explain why the base of the party acts as it does.

“What could be more niche than a young congressman who used to play in a punk band in Texas [Beto O’Rourke]? Well, maybe a gay mayor from a small city in the Midwest [Buttigieg],” he wrote.

Candidates today worry less about establishment credentialing because there are new ways to build a political brand.

“We’ve become a more democratic, small-D, society,” said pollster Peter Hart. “There’s no establishment. There aren’t bosses and kingmakers. We’re in a freelance society at this stage of the game. With everything that’s happening on social media . . . the barriers to entry are so much lower.”

Cues from party leaders count for less, as candidates build their own followings. Sid Milkis, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, argued that, for all their differences, Trump and Obama share something more than nontraditional résumés. “They see or saw themselves as heads of a movement. They didn’t just envision themselves as presidential candidates,” he said. “And secondly, both kept their distance — and you could say weakened — the official party organization.”

Not only have barriers to entry been lowered, but the qualifications that were once considered assets now can carry liabilities. At a time of gridlock and constant partisan warfare, legislative experience in Washington has been devalued. The baggage of thousands of votes can easily become a burden to a longtime incumbent. Biden is proof of that, as he has had to answer for or explain decisions and votes he took decades ago that have been reinterpreted through the lens of today’s politics.

Candidates today also know that the opportunity to become president must be seized, even if more seasoning would be helpful.

“Obama was an example of that,” said Joel Goldstein, a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law. “Even though you’ve got [Hillary] Clinton running [in 2008], people were saying don’t wait around.”

That was the message David Axelrod, Obama’s chief strategist, gave to the young senator as he was making his final decision to run for president.

“History is replete with potential candidates for president who waited too long rather than examples of people who ran too soon,” he wrote in a memo in late 2006. “You will never be hotter than you are right now.”

The cycles of history have produced varying paths to the presidency. In the earliest days, as America was still in its formative stages, one common characteristic was diplomatic experience, as ambassadors abroad or service as secretaries of state. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams all shared this in their résumés.

Adams and Jefferson also served as vice president, the first two of 14 men who occupied that office. Some of the 14 ascended to the presidency upon the death or resignation of a president; others were elected outright. In the 1960s and ’70s, three presidents in a row — Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford — had served as vice president.

Through much of the 20th century, governmental experience marked the résumés of presidents. Herbert Hoover had earned a reputation as a skilled executive by organizing humanitarian relief efforts in Europe after World War I and later distinguished himself as a commerce secretary with outsize influence. Franklin D. Roosevelt had served as assistant secretary of the Navy during World War I, vice-presidential nominee in 1920 and a term as governor of New York on his way to the presidency.

In the decades immediately after World War II, Americans elected a succession of presidents with notable Washington experience. Harry S. Truman was a 10-year veteran of the Senate before becoming Roosevelt’s vice president. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s military career included Washington experience and the invaluable role as commander of the allied forces that liberated the European continent from the Nazis. Johnson, Nixon and John F. Kennedy served in both the House and Senate. Ford spent more than two decades in the House, including more than eight years as Republican leader.

“Then we turned a page,” said Roger Porter, a professor of government at Harvard’s Kennedy School and a former White House adviser to Presidents Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. From 1976 until the election of 2008, most of the successful candidates (George H.W. Bush being the exception) shared two qualities: state government experience and the claim of being a Washington outsider.

Jimmy Carter was the first of the new breed, a one-term governor of Georgia who ran for the Democratic nomination against a large field of candidates, many with deep Washington experience. But after Vietnam and Watergate, Carter caught the mood of an electorate disillusioned with the federal government and its leaders. He was untarnished by Washington but still offered executive experience at the state level.

Carter’s election “opened the floodgates” to this different model of presidents, Nelson said. After Carter came Reagan, who had been the two-term governor of California. In 1992, the country elected Bill Clinton, the young governor of Arkansas, turning out Bush, who had been Reagan’s vice president, after a single term. Clinton was succeeded by Bush’s son, George W. Bush, who in addition to his family name had twice been elected governor of Texas.

“We said we want people to have executive experience, but we’re happy to have it in state government,” Porter said. “Now we have had two presidents who had none of that.”

People often point to Abraham Lincoln as an example of someone who came to the presidency with virtually no governmental experience, just a single term in the House as a representative from Illinois. In contemporary terms, Lincoln had a background that is not dissimilar to that of Beto O’Rourke, who is running for the Democratic nomination today: service in the House and a losing campaign for Senate that nonetheless helped vault him to national prominence.

For Lincoln, it was the historic debates with Stephen A. Douglas that propelled him forward. Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin noted that those debates were later published and distributed nationally. That brought Lincoln speaking invitations beyond the borders of Illinois, including his powerful anti-slavery speech at Cooper Union in New York in early 1860 that helped win him the nomination and presidency.

“It spread his name beyond Illinois,” Goodwin said. “He became a national figure because of those debates.”

Trump isn’t the first president with celebrity appeal. Theodore Roosevelt became famous through the Spanish-American War. Eisenhower had near-universal stature as a war hero. In 1960, Kennedy lacked the reputation of some of the giants in the Senate, including Johnson, but had the qualities of glamour and family riches that helped to elevate him.

The power of television and social media have made celebrity an important, if not essential, quality for someone seeking the presidency in this era. Today a politician can create some celebrity appeal almost overnight. Buttigieg initially caught the attention of Democratic activists through a CNN town hall. O’Rourke drew a national audience last year through a viral video in which he defended pro football player Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee during the national anthem.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is the ultimate example. She wasn’t known a year ago. “Now she’s on the cover of magazines,” Goodwin said. If she were 35 years old rather than 29, it’s likely she would be talked about as a possible candidate for president.

Trump’s celebrity proved to be one of the most important assets in 2016. Though he was a well-known businessman, he could not claim the executive skills of the head of a company with tens of thousands of employees. Instead, his background as a reality TV star distinguished him from other candidates for the GOP nomination — and allowed him to use media to his advantage.

“Trump is in some ways the culmination of these trends that have been underway since the Vietnam and Watergate era,” Nelson said. “What Trump added was [being able to say], ‘I’ve never held office in Washington. I’ve never held office at all. That’s all the more reason to send me to drain the swamp.’ ”

Trump supporters point to this quality as one of the reasons they were attracted to him as a candidate. When asked what he liked about Trump, Jeff Bartulla, who lives in Montgomery, Tex., and works in the oil field services industry, said: “That he wasn’t part of government. I was sick of watching [members of Congress] twiddle their thumbs and make excuses.”

The victories by Obama and Trump have rewritten the history of presidential politics. One contribution by Obama — the breakup of the white male hold on the presidency — appears likely to be a permanent change, though obviously not in every single election in the future. At a minimum, no one expects the Democratic ticket in 2020 to be composed of two white men.

Democratic voters appear torn about what they want in a nominee, attracted to newcomers but not ready to make a final judgment. Judy Stavitz of Toms River, N.J., who badly wants Trump defeated, said that the mold of what kind of person can be president “has been broken by the buffoon in the White House right now.” So far she has found Buttigieg appealing — but also sees merit in Biden.

That is one reason Harvard’s Porter questioned whether the most recent elections signal a genuine shift in the kind of candidate future voters will favor or whether they were the result of special circumstances.

Will the experience of the Trump presidency push voters back to a more traditional candidate? Perhaps, but voters seem far more willing to weigh many options these days. Bob Tyson, the North Carolina Republican, put it this way: “I think voters are willing to consider anybody, if they make the right impression on them.”

Homeland Security chief denies he threatened to leave over clash with Stephen Miller,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/homeland-security-chief-denies-he-threatened-to-resign-over-clash-with-stephen-miller,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan denied a report that he threatened to resign if he was not given more authority over his agency after a clash with White House adviser Stephen Miller.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that McAleenan grew angry after Miller tried to dictate hiring at the agency and a ""power struggle"" followed.

McAleenan was asked Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” if he had threatened to leave. “No,” he responded, saying he planned to lead the department for as long as he had the opportunity.

But he refused to discuss whether he had fought with Miller, who is known as an immigration hardliner.

“Look, I'm not going to talk about rumors or any alleged internal conversations,” McAleenan said.

President Trump appointed McAleenan to lead Homeland Security temporarily after Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted as secretary last month at Miller’s urging. Other top officials, including acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ron Vitiello, have been removed at Miller’s insistence.

Nielsen and Vitiello had challenged Miller’s proposal to conduct mass arrests in 10 cities of migrant parents and children eligible for deportation."

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."

New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

Homeland Security flying migrants out of Texas to locations throughout U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Nikki Battiste'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-flying-migrants-out-of-texas-to-locations-throughout-u-s-florida-san-diego/,"With the surge of asylum seekers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol are now flying migrants from the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas to cities across the country.

In San Diego on Friday, 100 migrants arrived for processing. It came one day after two south Florida counties were upset with a plan that would bring thousands of migrants there.

""We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""I think it'll tax our resources, the schools, healthcare, law enforcement, state agencies.""

CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House, but neither has responded.

Florida officials have been told to expect two plane loads of migrants each week, up to 1,000 people a month, split between Palm Beach and Broward counties. Both are Democratic strongholds. The migrants do not face criminal charges but would likely be released into the community awaiting immigration hearings.

CBS News reporting found that 80% of the beds at the nation's largest detention center for immigrant families in Dilley, Texas were empty last month. But Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they're overwhelmed.

""The crisis at hand is causing us to look at multiple different locations where we have capacity to process, to fly these individuals to, simply so we can process them into the system,"" Hastings said.

Florida has no designated shelters or government funding for food and security. Officials there have been told to expect migrants in about two weeks."
Devin Nunes 'likely' sending obstruction criminal referral over Steele-State Department meeting,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-likely-sending-obstruction-criminal-referral-over-steele-state-department-meeting,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said on Sunday that he may send another criminal referral to the Justice Department.

During an interview on Fox News, Nunes said notes about a meeting between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and a State Department official were withheld from the House Intelligence Committee during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that wrapped up last year.

""It's likely now, as we do our investigation as to why we didn't get this information that we've just been discussing from the State Department two years ago when we should have received it, there could be another referral coming on obstruction a congressional investigation,"" he said.

Newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec cast doubt on the reliability of his dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application that was submitted later that month against onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election on Nov. 8.

The Daily Caller reported the notes show Steele identified Russian sources, including former Russian foreign intelligence director Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Vladislav Surkov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Nunes said Clinton's campaign and the DNC ""plainly colluded"" with the Russians to receive and disseminate false information about Trump.

Last month, Nunes notified the Justice Department of ""several potential violations of the law"" in eight criminal referrals as part of an investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department citing concerns that Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers. Both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Steele and the opposition research firm who hired him, Fusion GPS.

The notes from the Steele-Kavalec meeting came out after special counsel Robert Mueller found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The House Intelligence Committee found no Trump-Russia collusion in its assessment.

Attorney General William Barr has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut with reviewing the origins of the federal Russia investigation."
"Commander in chief Donald Trump, threatening 'official end of Iran' is not the endgame America needs",https://www.usatoday.com,"['The Editorial Board', 'Usa Today', 'Published P.M. Et May']",05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/05/19/iran-endgame-president-donald-trump-tell-americans-editorials-debates/3695295002/,"CLOSE President Trump spoke about Iran in an interview on Fox. Trump emphasized that he isn't looking for war, but he just doesn't want Iran to have nuclear weapons. AP

Tweets like 'Never threaten the United States again!' won't prepare Americans if saber rattling turns sobering reality: Our view

In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.

As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that’s not what we’re getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, “I hope not,” to a reporter’s shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.

Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!”

As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.

The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he’s not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.

The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U.S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.

OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump replaces Barack Obama’s mirage with containment

Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran’s nuclear program.

Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.

There’s no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.

The sanctions are aimed at making Iran “conform to the normal things that normal nations do,” Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn’t believe this himself. “I just don’t see it,” the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.

And Trump’s other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.

Is regime change the goal? This hasn’t worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U.S.-led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U.S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.

Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a “deal” to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.

Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?

And what is the plan? Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can’t convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.

If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his staff spent roughly $124,000 in excessive travel costs during a ten-month period, according to a new report from EPA's internal watchdog.

Pruitt, who resigned from EPA almost a year ago amidst a litany of ethics allegations, and his personal security detail flew in first or business class ""without sufficient justification and, initially without appropriate approval authority,"" the report says.

The EPA's Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency consider recovering the estimated $123,942 in excessive costs.

In a statement, the EPA says it believes that it complied with federal travel regulations, ""making cost recovery inappropriate.""

The audit reviewed 40 trips, including six canceled ones, that Pruitt planned or took in 2017. Nearly half of those trips stopped in, or were to, Tulsa, Okla., where Pruitt maintained a personal residence while he was the nation's top environmental steward. The report found ""missing detailed support"" for some of those trips.

The travel during that ten-month period cost taxpayers almost $1 million.

Pruitt's 24-hour security detail ate up most of that money. In a previous audit, EPA's inspector general found that the agency spent twice as much protecting Pruitt as it did his predecessor.

The EPA and Pruitt, who now works as a consultant for coal companies, said those protections were necessary because of personal threats against the former-administrator.

During his 16-month stint as head of the EPA, Pruitt's security costs, travel and other actions drew criticism from his predecessors, Democrats, environmental groups and even some Republican lawmakers.

The EPA's inspector general says the office received numerous congressional requests and hotline complaints about Pruitt's travel. The new report came as a result of those.

In addition to first-class travel, the audit found that lodging expenses exceeded per diem limits during some of Pruitt's travel as well. There was also inaccurate or incomplete reports for international travel.

Pruitt is not the first member of the Trump administration to be questioned about his travel on the taxpayer dime.

Tom Price, the former head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, broke federal rules on using chartered and military planes for government travel. Price resigned amidst controversy over that, as President Trump complained that he ""didn't like the optics"" of using taxpayer-funded charter flights.

A report by the Interior Department's inspector general found that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated the agency's travel policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles.

The EPA's watchdog says that actions are needed to strengthen controls over travel at the agency to ""prevent fraud, waste and abuse."""
"Dagen McDowell: Obama-era FBI, DOJ officials 'worried' what Barr's review into Russia probe could find",https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dagen-mcdowell-obama-era-fbi-doj-officials-worried-what-barrs-review-into-russia-probe-could-find,"Are Obama-era intelligence officials worried about what Attorney General William Barr's investigation Ito the origins of the Russia probe will find?

Fox Business' Dagen McDowell believes they are, and said that is why some Democrats are questioning Barr's motives.

""They are trying to discredit him because they are worried, people who worked in the Obama administration, in the FBI and in the CIA and the intelligence community, they are worried. Whether it's Brennan or Comey or even subordinates of both of them. They are worried about what Bill Barr and John Durham and the Inspector General Michael Horowitz are going to find,"" McDowell said while co-hosting ""The Five.""

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

""They deserve answers. There is nothing wrong with a thorough look at it.""

State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

DHS Urges Cybersecurity Staff to ‘Deploy’ to Border Instead,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy-Woodruff Sam-Brodey', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'Sam Brodey']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-urges-cybersecurity-staff-to-deploy-to-border-instead,"The Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency—which also works to protect schools and places of worship—is urging staffers tasked with handling cyber threats to set their day jobs aside and go on mini-deployments to the U.S.-Mexico border after an earlier request from headquarters failed to recruit enough officials, according to an email obtained by The Daily Beast.

The effort to send more employees to the border comes amid concerns that the agency’s focus on the influx of migrants at the border is siphoning off DHS officials who should be handling other threats—especially to elections. DHS’s other components, including its intelligence arm, have also been asked to send volunteers to the border. It is unclear if those components have found enough volunteers to satisfy headquarters.

On Friday, the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sent out an email asking employees to consider a “short-term deployment to the southern border,” ranging from 30 to 45 days, due to the “ongoing surge of migrants.”

“It is never easy to ask colleagues to take on extra challenges, but as DHS employees, serving the needs of the homeland is the cornerstone of what we do,” wrote Matthew Travis, CISA deputy director, to agency employees.

“If it is in your capacity to deploy, please give serious thought to volunteering,” he added.

Earlier this spring, top officials asked employees from all DHS entities to go volunteer at the border, according to a DHS official. The email went out because CISA is still working to send as many people as DHS headquarters has asked for, the official added. In other words, not enough CISA employees want to step away from their cybersecurity work to focus on border security—at least, not yet.

“As we have consistently said, the Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” said Tyler Houlton, DHS acting assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

“We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem. As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

Among the officials who were asked on Friday to assist the federal government at the border are those tasked with protecting the U.S. government’s cyber infrastructure — including election systems considered vulnerable in the run-up to 2020.

DHS also said the deployments will not hamper the department’s other work.

“DHS is fully capable of deploying more resources to address the crisis at our southern border while simultaneously maintaining our operational capabilities throughout the Department in order to carry out our mission to protect the American people,” said Houlton.

DHS has been urging its personnel who do not work for Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement to volunteer at the border because they say those agencies need additional assistance due to the flow of migrants from the south. Roughly 400 employees of the Transportation Security Administration, for example, are expected to arrive at the border soon.

But DHS has not offered many details on what specific responsibilities these employees will handle. With many migrants traveling in large groups and often with young children, agents are spending much of their time attending to children, DHS officials have said.

The Border Patrol chief, Carla Provost, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8 that some agents are serving primarily as “child care professionals, medical caregivers, bus drivers and food service workers.”

Apprehensions of migrants at the southern border have reached a 13-year high. In the last two months, Border Patrol apprehended over 200,000 migrants; the total for April—109,000—is the highest number for a single month since 2007.

Trump administration officials are saying they do not have enough resources to handle the influx, and have requested an additional $4.5 billion for their operations from Congress. Democrats on Capitol Hill have signaled a willingness to fund humanitarian assistance at the border, but have scuttled other uses of funding, like increasing beds in ICE detention facilities."
Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""
Lawmaker demands answers after a WW II veteran died from a head injury in a VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/17/veterans-affairs-nursing-home-death-lawmaker-wants-answers/3693551002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, is demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs about the death of a World War II veteran from a head injury at the VA nursing home in Des Moines, Iowa.

Axne wants to know why James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., a legally blind 91-year-old with dementia, wasn’t monitored more closely and what policies are in place to prevent a similar injury or death.

“No veterans or their family member should have to worry they will experience what Mr. Ferguson and his family experienced,” Axne wrote in a letter to the VA Thursday.

Her concern follows a USA TODAY investigation that chronicled Ferguson’s case and what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly injury.

Ferguson was removed from one-on-one supervision, and he wandered into other residents' rooms repeatedly, medical records show. When he rolled his wheelchair into one room unsupervised Dec. 20, 2018, his son said VA staff told him the resident of the room flipped Ferguson backwards out of his wheelchair. He landed on his head, causing a massive brain bleed.

Nursing staff didn't report the incident for 40 minutes, according to the records and surveillance video. They didn't take him to the emergency room for more than two hours and he wasn't transferred to a trauma hospital until five hours after the fall. He died from the injury two days later.

In her letter to VA headquarters in Washington, Axne asked about resident supervision policies, and reporting and response procedures for accidents, including head injuries.

“The timeline of events raises concerns regarding patient monitoring and injury reporting procedures,” she wrote. “Our veterans deserve the highest standard of care, and they need to know that VA standards, policies and procedures are being met.”

VA national spokesman Curt Cashour said agency officials ""will respond to the representative directly."" He referred to an earlier statement from Des Moines VA spokesman Timothy Hippen that said a policy review after the “untimely death” concluded “all staff acted properly.""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, Hippen and Cashour have declined to say what policies are in place to prevent such traumatic injuries at the VA nursing home in Des Moines or elsewhere. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care each year at the VA’s 134 nursing home across the country.

Axne said in an interview Thursday that she had spoken with Ferguson’s son, and he “obviously still has questions and believes internal policies weren’t adequate.” She asked VA for responses to her questions within 30 days.

“I want to know how this happened so that we can make sure that it never happens again,” Axne said.

Ferguson was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward at the VA Medical Center in Des Moines in November after his dementia worsened. He had been in a private nursing home but became aggressive and wandered into other residents’ rooms. VA healthcare providers adjusted his medications and placed him on one-on-one observation with an aide to prevent him from straying into other rooms.

But on Dec. 11, 2018, staff removed the strict observation even though he was still determined to be a danger to himself and others, the medical records show.

He was transferred to the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus the next day. Ferguson continued to enter other residents’ rooms repeatedly, but records show staff did not reinstate strict observation.

After the head injury at 3:49 p.m. Dec. 20, Ferguson wasn’t taken to the emergency room until about 6:30 p.m., and he wasn’t transferred to a trauma hospital until 8:55 p.m.

Hippen, the Des Moines VA spokesman, has declined to answer detailed questions about what happened. He said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

Ferguson’s son Jim said Thursday that he is grateful for Axne’s help in getting more answers about his father’s care.

“Now that I have had time to sit back and seen everything and thought about everything, I think, it’s horrible,” he said. “I hope they make changes.”

US ambassador to Germany ruffles State Department with budget stand,https://thehill.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/international/444296-us-ambassador-to-germany-ruffles-state-department-with-budget-stand,"U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is shaking up the State Department by not asking for an advanced funding increase for the American embassy in Berlin, defying one of Washington's customary budget practices.

Grenell’s stance against requesting a funding increase for future diplomatic operations in Germany isn’t sitting well with some State Department colleagues, but it’s winning applause from Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulBolton emerges as flashpoint in GOP debate on Iran US ambassador to Germany ruffles State Department with budget stand Overnight Defense: Congressional leaders receive classified briefing on Iran | Trump on war: 'I hope not' | Key Republican calls threats credible | Warren plan targets corporate influence at Pentagon MORE (R-Ky.), a fiscal hawk who's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Speaking to a small group of reporters by phone Thursday, Grenell said he surprised colleagues at State by asking for a zero percent increase in funding in his mission resource request for 2021.

“I have to give credit by saying President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump: 'I will not let Iran have nuclear weapons' Rocket attack hits Baghdad's Green Zone amid escalating tensions: reports Buttigieg on Trump tweets: 'I don't care' MORE and Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo expect us to be frugal and efficient with American taxpayer dollars. And when I was asked to think about future growth, I felt strongly this was an opportunity to take a stand and to implement exactly what the president and secretary of State said we should be doing,” Grenell told reporters.

The unusual display is getting support from Paul, one of the most outspoken budget hawks on Capitol Hill.

“So often people are fiscally conservative when it comes to somebody else’s budget, but I think it’s extraordinary when we get people who say, ‘You know what? We’re doing just fine with this budget and we can hold the line for another year.' I want to compliment our ambassador Rick Grenell for that,” Paul said on Thursday.

“If we had more people throughout government coming to the conclusion of not asking for more money next year, saying we can make do with what we have, I think we would have a lot less of a debt problem,” Paul added.

Grenell noted that last year the U.S. Embassy in Berlin came in 5.8 percent under budget, reducing costs by $7.7 million in federal funding. But the money isn't returned to the U.S. Treasury; instead, it's sent back to the State Department’s European bureau, where it can be redeployed for other operations.

The embassy's budget for 2018 was approximately $132 million.

The State Department and the European bureau take all the mission resource requests from each diplomatic post and use them to calculate the final budget request to Congress.

Grenell said he wants to send a message to other diplomatic posts that “we can deal with zero growth.”

Paul added that the embassy in Germany “could be a model for all the embassies around the world.”

“Everybody’s always saying, ‘Oh, we don’t have enough money for this or that. But like everything else in government, everybody wants more, more, more ever year,” he said.

Grenell’s unorthodox move is ruffling some feathers at the State Department, where annual funding increases are often taken for granted.

A senior embassy official in charge of the budget described “surprise from the bureau level in Washington” when Grenell asked for no increase.

“I like to hope at least this philosophy of ours has sparked a conversation about how we do these resource requests and how we build our overall request at the department,” the official said.

Grenell is one of Trump’s most outspoken and controversial diplomats.

He made headlines this month by warning German companies they could be banned from the United States if they continue to do business with Iran.

“You can do as much business as you want in Iran, but we have a say with regards to your visa,” Grenell told Bild newspaper. “Because if you do something, we’re not going to agree to let you enter our country.”

He came under fire from German political leaders earlier this year after he criticized Germany for not spending more of its gross domestic product on defense as part of its NATO commitment.

Wolfgang Kubicki, a vice president of the Bundestag, warned, “Any U.S. diplomat who acts like a high commissioner of an occupying power must learn that our tolerance also knows its limits.”"
Treasury Official Hired to Fix Fannie and Freddie Is Leaving,https://www.nytimes.com,['Emily Flitter'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/business/craig-phillips-treasury-fannie-mae-freddie-mac.html,"Investors snapped up Fannie’s and Freddie’s shares in anticipation. One of the big bettors was the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, run by William A. Ackman, which first took a position in the shares in 2013. The fund held 116 million Fannie shares at the end of March, according to securities filings compiled by FactSet, a data provider. That position would currently be worth more than $300 million.

Shares of both Fannie and Freddie have more than doubled this year, although they are still far below their pre-crisis levels.

But overhauling Fannie and Freddie has proved to be a complicated and politically thorny endeavor. The Obama administration tried and failed. Congress is deeply divided on the issue, which has the potential to affect the lives and finances of tens of millions of Americans.

Trump administration officials have been trying to jump-start the overhaul efforts this year, but with limited results.

Mr. Phillips and other Treasury officials have been meeting with the biggest American banks to determine how best to raise capital for Fannie and Freddie — a prerequisite to releasing them from government control — as well as how the housing finance system might be restructured, according to two people who participated in the meetings.

Mark Calabria, the recently confirmed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, said in a speech this week that he had the power to release the companies back into the private sector. But, he said, Congress would need to act to make such a plan viable by empowering the agency to better regulate the privatized companies.

Mr. Phillips is not the only confidant of Mr. Mnuchin on his way out. The Treasury’s assistant secretary for international markets, Heath Tarbert, has been nominated to be chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will leave if confirmed by the Senate. And Eli Miller, who was Mr. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, left in April to join the private equity firm Blackstone."
Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."

Interior published four months' worth of Bernhardt’s schedules to its website on Thursday, a day after he appeared before the House Natural Resources Committee.

While some entries released by the agency list the names of attendees at meetings, others only describe him as having a scheduled ""external meeting."" ADVERTISEMENT

One House Democrat called the Trump Cabinet member's schedules a ""fake calendar.""

Huffman, a member of the Natural Resources Committee, added, “This fake calendar only has details if something is politically useful - e.g. 'meeting w/ youth group.' How dumb does he think we are?”

Interior, when asked to respond to criticism of the entries, sent a letter from March 26 addressed to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) explaining how the office maintains Bernhardt’s calendar.

Bernhardt’s calendars have been an ongoing source of criticism for the department. House Democrats have raised questions over whether the department’s use of Google Docs to maintain his calendar complies with recordkeeping laws.

Interior has offered conflicting information about how Bernhardt’s schedule is maintained, but in April acknowledged that some meetings with industry representatives were intentionally left off his calendar.

Aaron Weiss, deputy director at The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, argued that “it’s not an accident that they waited until the day after his hearing” to share the calendars.

“They’re playing a shell game with Bernhardt’s calendar to still have to avoid saying publicly what he’s working on and who he’s meeting with,” he said.

Washington Post: Acting Homeland Security chief threatened to leave over Stephen Miller,https://www.cnn.com,['Caroline Kelly'],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/politics/wapo-miller-mcaleenan-clash/index.html,"(CNN) Acting Homeland Security Director Kevin McAleenan threatened to step down this week if he did not get more authority over his agency in response to another attempt by White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller to dictate agency hiring, The Washington Post reported Friday.

The clash highlights yet another instance of Miller causing tension with his far-reaching influence as a counselor on immigration matters to President Donald Trump.

The private confrontation centered on Miller's advice to Trump that he should pick Mark Morgan -- whom Trump has named to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- for commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, and keep current acting ICE Director Matthew Albence in his role, the paper reported.

Three Trump administration officials told the Post that McAleenan informed senior White House officials that he, not Miller, leads the department and that he should have at least a hand in departmental hiring choices. McAleenan met with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the officials said. One Trump aide described the internal turmoil surrounding the issue as akin to an ""immigration knife fight.""

Three Homeland Security officials told the Post that Morgan will begin as acting ICE director next week, while Albence will return to his role as deputy director of the agency -- a win for McAleenan.

CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
China's Huawei restricted from using U.S. suppliers,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-commerce/us-commerce-department-publishes-huawei-export-blacklist-order-idUSKCN1SM2MG,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday officially added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist, immediately enacting restrictions that will make it extremely difficult for the telecom giant to do business with U.S. companies.

The logo of Huawei is seen at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau

The Commerce Department issued a rule, promised on Wednesday, putting Huawei and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries on its so-called Entity List, a move that bans the company from buying parts and components from American firms without U.S. government approval.

Obtaining such approval will not be easy. The U.S. government will review license applications under a “policy of presumption of denial,” according to a posting on the Federal Register.

The order takes effect immediately, a Commerce Department spokesman said, although it will not be formally published in the Federal Register until Tuesday.

Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The action comes as the world’s two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

In a one-two punch, the order came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk.

The United States believes Huawei’s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.

The Commerce Department first gave notice on Wednesday that it was adding Huawei to the list.

Huawei has been “involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,” the order says.

As an example, the order cites a criminal case pending against the company in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case.

It notes that the indictment also accuses Huawei of “deceptive and obstructive acts.”

Members of Congress and administration officials said the move would make it difficult for Huawei to sell many products because of its dependence on U.S. suppliers.

COLLATERAL DAMAGE?

Washington lawyer Douglas Jacobson, a trade expert, said there would be collateral impact on the U.S. companies that sell to Huawei.

“While the intent is to punish Huawei, ultimately U.S. companies are also being penalized,” Jacobson said.

Analysts cut price targets on several microchip companies, including Xilinx Inc. Shares of Xilinx closed down 7.3 percent, while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc fell 4 percent.

Given the order, the likelihood that Commerce will grant licenses to allow sales is negligible, Jacobson said.

Still, history shows the government could offer reprieves. In 2016, Huawei’s smaller rival ZTE Corp was added to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries.

U.S. companies were prohibited from selling parts and components to ZTE for about two weeks, before the Commerce Department issued a series of temporary general licenses that allowed the company to continue to do business with U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

The saga of ZTE did not end there. In April 2018, the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies selling components to ZTE after accusing it of breaking an agreement, leading ZTE to cease major operations until it struck a new deal last summer."
"US non-essential personnel ordered to leave Iraq Embassy, consulate",https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-department-orders-all-non-essential-personnel-to-leave-iraq,"The State Department has ordered all non-emergency personnel at the U.S. Embassy and consulate in Iraq to leave the country amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

The announcement was made in a security alert on its website early Wednesday morning. The alert also said that normal visa services would be temporarily suspended.

This comes amid a standoff between the U.S. and Iran, which has recently threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal and resume higher uranium enrichment if no new deal is put in place.

The move coincided with Germany's decision on Tuesday to suspend training of Iraqi soldiers due to tensions in the region, though the government indicated no specific threats to its own troops.

German Defense Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff says that Germany is “orienting itself toward our partner countries, which have taken this step.”

The country currently has about 160 German soldiers in Iraq as part of the fight against ISIS, about 60 of them at a base north of Baghdad where Iraqi forces are being trained.

IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL AIDE SAYS TRUMP WILL 'GET A WAR' FOR LISTENING TO 'THE MUSTACHE' JOHN BOLTON

Trump warned Iran on Monday afternoon that it will “suffer greatly” if the country does “anything” in the form of an attack, a remark that came in the wake of revelations that U.S. military experts suggested “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday.

This also came just days before the regime warned it easily could destroy a naval fleet sent by the United States in order to ward off a potential threat to U.S. commercial interests.

“Their billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,” Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said, according to Reuters.

“If they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” he warned.

GEN. JACK KEANE SAYS REPORT TRUMP HAS UPDATED PLANS TO SEND 100,000 TROOPS TO IRAN IS 'DISTORTION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENS'

Last week, U.S. officials said urgent ""credible threats"" from Iran against Americans were detected and the embassy advised against all travel to the region, citing “heightened tensions.”

The president denied Tuesday the reports that the administration was planning to send more than 100,000 troops to the region in the wake of the war with Iran, but adding, “Would I do that? Absolutely ... If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed the president's claim, saying ""We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran, we’re looking for the regime to simply stop conducting assassination campaigns throughout Europe,” he said Tuesday in the seaside resort of Sochi, Russia.

Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also downplayed the escalation. Iran's state TV quoted Khamenei on Tuesday as calling negotiations with the U.S. ""poison"" and saying: ""This is not a military confrontation, because no war is going to happen.""

Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said: ""Neither we, nor they are seeking war, they know that it is not to their benefit.""

Iranian state media reported Wednesday however that Khamenei followed up these remarks by saying it wouldn't be difficult for the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels amid rising tensions with the U.S., state media reported Wednesday.

Exclusive: Trump EPA did not await court ruling to loosen biofuel rules for refiners - documents,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jarrett Renshaw', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels-exclusive/exclusive-trump-epa-did-not-await-court-ruling-to-loosen-biofuel-rules-for-refiners-documents-idUSKCN1SM13Z,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration made it easier for oil refineries to get waivers from the nation’s biofuel law at least four months before a 2017 court decision it often cites to justify the move to the corn lobby, and the move was motivated by a desire to save the oil industry money, Reuters has learned.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo/File Photo

The timing and motivation for the Environmental Protection Agency’s policy change, revealed through court documents and an interview with a former top agency official, have not been previously reported. This reinforces the concerns of the corn industry that the decision to expand the waiver program was made at the EPA’s discretion.

“EPA repeatedly told Congress its hands were tied and blamed the courts. That appears to have been a lie. EPA also said it was following Department of Energy recommendations. We also know that’s bunk. I’m going to get to the bottom of this,” U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from the farm state of Iowa, said in a statement on Thursday.

The waivers, granted to small refineries including those run by oil majors Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The waivers angered the corn lobby which argued they hurt farmers by threatening demand for ethanol.

Whether the EPA’s moves have hurt ethanol demand has been a topic of fierce debate.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits generated by those who do, but smaller refineries can be exempted if they prove compliance would cause them financial harm.

Trump’s EPA granted 35 such waivers for 2017, up sharply from seven in the final year of the Obama administration.

Court documents filed by a biofuels advocacy group show that the EPA changed the policy before May 4, 2017.

On that date, the EPA told a refining company in a letter that “we are changing our approach” to the waiver program by allowing exemptions to refineries even if their operations “are not significantly impaired” by compliance, according to the documents filed by the Advanced Biofuels Association in a challenge of the expanded waiver program.

That puts the policy shift at least four months ahead of an August 2017 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that found the agency was using too strict a standard when it denied Utah-based Sinclair Oil an exemption. The EPA subsequently withdrew its defense on a similar court case, and lost a third.

Those cases are often cited by EPA officials and refining industry representatives defending the expanded waiver program.

“The courts have clearly told us we have to follow the law, and that’s what we are going to do,” EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in April media interview when pressed about the expansion.

Mandy Gunasekara, who retired as principal deputy assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation this year, said the EPA under then-administrator Scott Pruitt had decided to “reinstate” the small refinery waiver program to help an industry that felt ignored by Obama.

She said Pruitt also believed loosening the standards could help lower the cost of compliance credits, known as RINS, which could help the entire industry as opposed to just smaller refiners.

“Certainly, one of the goals was to put downward pressure on the price of RINs,” she told Reuters in an interview.

She said the Sinclair case did not influence the changes to the waiver program. “When I saw the Sinclar decision come down, I saw it as a vindication of our changes,” she said.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud did not respond to questions about whether the agency still believes the small refinery program should be used to help manage RIN prices. He maintained that EPA has been consistent in its justification for the expansion of the waiver program.

“The premise of this story is wrong,” he said, adding that the waiver program has “been subject to appropriations language and court opinions prior to and during the Trump Administration.”

Expansion of waivers drove down RIN prices to multi-year lows last year. This helped refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc that had been purchasing them, along with CVR Energy Inc, owned by Icahn.

Icahn came under federal investigation after CVR was seen shorting the credit market in 2017 while he advocated for financial relief from the biofuel program.

Icahn and other merchant refiners had long complained that their profit margins were being squeezed by the law, which is nearly 15 years old. It was intended to help farmers and reduce U.S. reliance on energy imports.

The waiver provision was intended to temporarily exempt smaller refineries so they could invest in biofuel blending equipment."

James Comey accuses AG Barr of ‘sliming’ DOJ,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/18/james-comey-accuses-ag-barr-of-sliming-doj/,"Former FBI director James Comey on Friday accused Attorney General William P. Barr of “sliming” the Department of Justice and effectively serving as President Trump’s spokesman.

Mr. Comey criticized the attorney general on Twitter after Mr. Barr raised concerns this week about the origins of the government’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe led by the former FBI director prior to his firing by Mr. Trump in May 2017.

“The AG should stop sliming his own Department. If there are bad facts, show us, or search for them professionally and then tell us what you found. An AG must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth. Donald Trump has enough spokespeople,” Mr. Comey tweeted.

Mr. Comey had led the FBI for nearly four years when he was fired by Mr. Trump weeks after revealing that the bureau was investigating possible coordination between the president’s election campaign and Russia. Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI prior to Mr. Comey, was subsequently appointed special counsel and tasked with assuming control of the probe, which culminated last month in the release of a lengthy, heavily redacted report summarizing its results.

Mr. Trump has been highly critical of the government’s probe since prior to Mr. Mueller’s appointment, and Mr. Barr announced this week that a federal prosecutor in Connecticut has been assigned to investigate its origins.

“I think people have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we’re worried about foreign influence for the very same reason we shouldn’t be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so I’m not saying that happened, but I’m saying that we have to look at that,” Mr. Barr said in an interview aired Friday on Fox News.

A total of 34 people and three entities were criminally charged during the duration of the special counsel’s 22-month probe, including several Russians and former members of Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Mr. Barr, 68, was confirmed as attorney general in February. The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines last week to hold him in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena compelling him to provide lawmakers with an unredacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report.

"Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says",https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/student-loans-education-department-1447485,"Kathy Kraninger, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo education Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says

The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Education Department is impeding access to information that regulators need to oversee the nation’s largest student loan servicing companies.

Kathy Kraninger, the CFPB director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has accused the bureau of abandoning its responsibility to police companies that collect payments from student loan borrowers.

Story Continued Below

Kraninger said that “student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations” related to federal student loans, based on a December 2017 directive from the Education Department. The department is headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The CFPB “has pursued options that would have permitted it to obtain” the information it needs to supervise student loan servicers, Kraninger said in the letter, but she didn’t say whether those options had been successful. The letter was first reported by NPR.

Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Senate Democrats called Kraninger’s disclosure “disturbing news” in a letter to student loan servicers.

The senators said the Education Department had “removed a key weapon from CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers.” They also expressed concern that “federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' request for information.”

The CFPB has the authority to supervise large student loan servicing companies, regardless of whether they collect private student loans or federal student loans. That has long created tension between the Education Department and the CFPB over student loans.

The Education Department policy cited by Kraninger, first reported by POLITICO last year, orders federal student loan servicers to refuse requests for information from third parties like state attorneys general or the CFPB. The policy says those requests must instead be funneled through Education Department officials in order to comply with federal privacy laws.

The policy has been at the center of ongoing disputes between DeVos and state attorneys general seeking to investigate or take legal action against student loan servicers. DeVos has argued that her agency provides adequate oversight over the companies, rejecting efforts by state regulators to police the industry.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency “cooperates fully with federal law enforcement officials on matters related to the federal student aid programs.”

Hill said the policy prohibiting student loan servicers from responding directly to information requests by the CFPB or other regulators is about protecting the privacy of loan borrowers. Such requests for information “should be made to the Department, where they will be evaluated for compliance with the Privacy Act,” she said.

The Education Department has previously refused to say how many of those information requests it receives — and whether or not it has granted them. Senate appropriators last year directed the department to publicly disclose those decisions, but the department has declined to do so.

Court records reviewed by POLITICO last year showed that the Education Department had also turned down requests for student loan records made directly by state attorneys general.

The department last year also refused a request for information by the CFPB for information about Navient in connection with CFPB's massive lawsuit against the student loan servicer.

The CFPB said at the time that the Education Department was refusing to give permission for Navient to turn over a trove of documents relating to how the company collects and manages the payments of federal student loan borrowers.

A federal judge ultimately sided with the CFPB in the dispute. He ruled that Navient “cannot assert that the records may ultimately belong to the Department of Education or use the Privacy Act to shield the requested borrower documents” from the CFPB’s requests.

House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about what his department is doing to address the causes and effects of climate change, noting that levels of carbon dioxide just hit their highest in human history.

His response? “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.”

The exchange is the latest escalation between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over what responsibility the Interior Department, which oversees more than 400 million acres of federal lands, bears in blunting a worldwide problem such as global warming. It came amid a barrage of legal citations from Democrats who claimed that current law compels the leader of the department to protect public lands from its impacts.

The remark came as Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) pressed Bernhardt about how concerned, on a scale of 1 to 10, he was about the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsing 415 parts per million, as recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

“Okay, so you're a zero or a one, is that it?” Cartwright said in response.

Later in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) gave Bernhardt the chance to expand on his comment, saying that for climate scientists it is a “hair-on-fire crisis.”

“It’s one of those clips of testimony that will reverberate,” he said. “People will look back to what you said.”

Indeed, after the hearing, environmental groups shared widely on social media videos of Bernhardt's “sleep” comment.

In response, Bernhardt said: “I absolutely care that our climate is changing and that we need to factor that into our thinking. I absolutely believe that. And I've said that over and over and over.”

He noted that among developed nations, the United States is “number one” in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The hearing Wednesday in front of the House Natural Resources Committee, ostensibly to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal for the department, was Bernhardt's second since being confirmed as interior secretary.

Last week in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Bernhardt punted the climate issue to Congress, telling members it was up to them to pass legislation compelling him to reduce emissions from public lands. Between 2005 and 2014, a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

“There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said, referring to the word in law that indicates a legally binding requirement. “You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

In the intervening days, House Democrats had clearly dusted off law books.

During the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) chided the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that sought to limit the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by oil and gas wells on the Bureau of Land Management lands.

And another Democrat, Mike Levin of California, rattled off four laws that, for example, compel the interior secretary to ensure that national parks are “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” and to “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” to BLM areas.

Bernhardt suggests the language in those laws did not direct him to do anything specific in response to climate change, such as stop leasing land for coal, oil or natural gas extraction.

“What I specifically said is you haven’t given me any direction to stop any particular activity,” he said.

John Leshy, interior solicitor under President Clinton, said that the legal language authorizing the government's land management programs is “necessarily general.”

“I give Bernhardt credit,” Leshy told The Post. “He's a wily guy.”

Leshy said Levin could also have mentioned the Endangered Species Act, which compels the interior secretary to use the “best available” science to determine whether a plant or animal is under threat of extinction.

On the dangers of climate change to biodiversity, he said, “the science is increasingly clear.”

At one point in yesterday's hearing, Democrats got Bernhardt to acknowledge that some laws — including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions — compel him to take climate change into account when managing lands.

“Certainly, NEPA would be one to them.”

Correction: The original version of this story referred to California Rep. Mike Levin as Mark Levin.

The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change, and our country's fate, in one sentence from @SecBernhardt: ""I haven't lost any sleep over it.""



They don't care. Thanks to @RepCartwright, we don’t have to guess any more.

— Controversial mining leases renewed: BLM has renewed two federal minerals leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine by Minnesota mining company Twin Metals. The controversial decision follows a years-long clash over opening the state to minerals mining, the Star Tribune reports. The leases were ended by the Obama administration in 2016 over concerns about the environmental risks of mining near a protected wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

Trump administration touts economic benefit of new mining: “Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management.

“Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management. But Minnesota lawmakers are gearing up for a fight: ""Every sulfide-ore mine has failed to contain pollution and has affected the surrounding water quality,"" said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.). ""Once polluted, this incredible landscape and its wildlife will never been the same.""

— 2020 watch: Two Democratic presidential candidates, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, are out this week with new climate policies.

Warren: In a post on Medium, Warren laid out a plan requiring the Pentagon to reach net-zero carbon emissions for its infrastructure and non-combat bases by 2030. Her plan also calls for creating a “dedicated source of funding to adapt our bases in the United States and around the world."" It also targets contractors hired by the Defense Department, proposing that any contractor that doesn't reach the net-zero emissions mark pay 1 percent of the value of the contract, which would be used to “to invest directly in making our military infrastructure more resilient.”

— A plan to put up border wall through protected lands: The federal government is looking to replace barriers across 100 miles of the southern border with Mexico in California and Arizona, including through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Associated Press reports, citing environmental advocates and government documents.

The refuge specifically is meant to provide a designated home for 275 wildlife species. The report follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous laws in order to build more border wall. “The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,” the Center for Biological Diversity’s Laiken Jordahl told the AP.

— ""So you think we can innovate our way out of this?"" The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday hearing on climate change was the first to focus on the issue in a dozen years, the Washington Examiner reports, and lawmakers discussed various topics, including a carbon tax and clean energy.

During the hearing, Republican members also acknowledged there’s been a shift in rhetoric on the issue from their party. “We have gone from full of claims of [being] climate deniers to now we seem to be progress deniers,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said, suggesting Democrats haven’t appreciated the shift. “We are making progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we can learn from what’s brought us that progress to solve the challenge ahead of us, which is real.”

But: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) meanwhile, dismissed what he called “happy talk” about progress. “There was no acknowledgment about the terrible [climate change] impacts that are getting worse, and the Trump administration's concerted effort to make it even worse. So you think we can innovate our way out of this? We are on a path that is going to be very grim.”

— New York's pipeline predicament: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has until Thursday to decide whether to approve a proposed pipeline that would connect natural gas fields in Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York. The pipeline has been at the center of debate about the state’s energy future, the New York Times reports.

Environmental advocates are worried about the impact on vulnerable ecosystems and establishing a reliance on fossil fuels as some New Yorkers look toward pushing renewable energy sources. “While the pipeline has not attracted anywhere near the attention of the Keystone XL or Dakota Access pipelines in the Great Plains region, which carry oil, supporters and opponents alike said the gas project could be similarly consequential,” the Times reports.

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California state fire officials have concluded that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. equipment is to blame for the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in November and was the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the deadly blaze was sparked by electrical transmission lines controlled by the state’s largest utility and located in the community of Pulga, The Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler reports. In February, the company acknowledged it is “probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”

— An “an invisible cost” to deadly fires: Fire officials spoke to state lawmakers at a joint California Senate and Assembly hearing this week about the toll frequent deadly fires are having on firefighters and their mental health, as one fire captain from Sacramento called it an “invisible cost that’s rarely discussed.”

In California alone, the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance reports there have been 46 firefighter and emergency medical worker suicides in the past five years. Across the country, there have been 33 firefighter and emergency medical personnel suicides this year, E&E News reports. “At the hearing, fire officials said they needed more mental health support for emergency workers, both in the field during events and after the fires. They also said they needed more fire suppression personnel overall.”

— A trade-off for fast-growing trees: Although certain types of plants and trees could experience accelerated growth as a result of higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, a new study suggests those same trees could die faster, too. That means even as some experts say faster-growing trees could help combat global warming by drawing carbon in and storing the gas at higher rates, a new study in Nature Communications found “faster-growing trees also die younger, meaning the carbon they store goes back into the atmosphere more quickly,” E&E News reports.

Creation of an “Advanced Energy Storage Initiative” that would facilitate collaboration across the DOE’s offices to rapidly increase storage capabilities and integrations

Continued research on new storage devices and materials, including the “development of open source models and software tools for system level energy storage planning and evaluation""

Design and construction of a grid storage “launchpad” at the Pacific Northwest National Lab that would allow teams to test and evaluate new advanced storage technologies

Yes, but: The DOE’s energy storage initiatives do not address other challenges to implementation, including obstructive or unclear state policies.

The outcomes of evolving proceedings in the wake of FERC Order 841 — which requires wholesale power markets to develop rules that allow energy storage resources to participate — could affect the program's success. Some regional transmission organizations are already asking for extensions to FERC compliance deadlines for crafting storage policies.

Watch to watch: The DOE is requesting $5 million to build the launchpad, an expenditure it will partially offset with a $2.5 million reduction in research spending elsewhere.

While these numbers are rounding errors in the context of DOE’s $2.3 billion request for energy innovation and independence programs, the case for this swap will still need to be made to Congress.

The Commerce Department reported Friday (May 17) that eCommerce sales were up 12.4 percent from last year to $127.3 billion, measured in terms of non-seasonally-adjusted data.

The department said that, in terms of data adjusted for seasonal variability but not for price, eCommerce sales hit an all-time high of $137.7 billion in the first quarter.

The 12.4 percent pace of growth far outpaced that of total retail sales, which gained 2 percent in the quarter. The most recent eCommerce numbers show that for the first quarter, online commerce was 10.2 percent of total sales.

And eCommerce sales have doubled through the past five years, noted Seeking Alpha, reaching a recent threshold last year of more than $500 billion.

The Commerce Department also said in its Friday release that as measured against fourth-quarter data, eCommerce sales gained 3.6 percent (down 19.7 percent on a non-adjusted basis), while retail sales were unchanged (down 11.8 percent unadjusted).

In anecdotal evidence of the traction that digital sales are gaining at marquee retailers — and where general trends echoed the aforementioned Commerce Depart data during earnings season — Walmart stated that its eCommerce sales grew by 37 percent. Management said on the earnings call with investors that online sales were driven largely by gains in apparel and home goods. The latest tally for Walmart represents an acceleration of growth in online sales compared to the 33 percent growth Walmart logged a year ago. It also marks a decline in the 43 percent growth logged during the holiday season in the fourth quarter.

As measured as a percentage of total retail sales, eCommerce has steadily gained bigger slices of the pie. The Commerce Department reported that, before the latest 10.2 percent, the tally was 9.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, and 9.4 percent a year ago in the first quarter of 2018, as measured in seasonally-adjusted terms."
Abundant Supplies are Forecast for the Coming Crop Year in the U.S. and Around the World,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Seth Meyer', 'Chairman', 'World Agricultural Outlook Board', 'Waob']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/05/17/abundant-supplies-are-forecast-coming-crop-year-us-and-around-world,"Research and Science Posted by Seth Meyer, Chairman, World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) in Farming

An image depicting rainfall levels in Brazil from a recent briefing on the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report.

It’s a new year at USDA, at least for those of us forecasting agricultural commodity markets. Every May, the World Agricultural Outlook Board (WAOB) in the Office of the Chief Economist releases USDA’s initial projections of the markets for the crops and livestock that will be produced and harvested in the new crop year. WAOB develops USDA’s official forecasts by coordinating Interagency Commodity Estimates Committees (ICECs) to compile the latest and most comprehensive information and intelligence available from across USDA agencies. On May 10, USDA released its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report with these estimates for the 2019/20 crop year. The report also includes updated information on the 2018/19 and previous marketing years, but the early assessment of the “new crop” is a focal point of the May report.

This month’s WASDE projects abundant corn, soybean, and wheat supplies for the coming crop year, both in the U.S. and around the world, with modest growth in livestock and products. With soybean prices under pressure from Chinese tariffs and uncertainty on demand by China’s feed industry for soybeans due to the reduction in its hog herd from African Swine Fever, U.S. farmers have signaled a shifting of some acres from soybeans to corn. At the same time, with good second crop corn production in Brazil adding competition to the global market, along with expanded domestic corn acreage, U.S. corn stocks are expected to build by 390 million bushels to the highest level since the late 1980s. These abundant supplies are projected to push corn prices down to a season average price of $3.30 a bushel, the lowest since 2007. Despite the anticipated contraction of U.S. soybean acres, with Chinese soybean crush demand forecast to be flat in 2019/20 after a contraction in 2018/19, U.S. stocks are expected to fall minimally from the 2018/19 forecast record of 995 million bushels, keeping soybean prices under pressure until those stocks are worked down.

Wheat is the crop we know the most about as of May, since the winter wheat crop was planted in the fall. This year, the global wheat market is characterized by favorable weather across most major growing regions of the world, leading to a current expectation that major exporters will have larger crops in 2019/20 than the year prior. This will pose significant competition for U.S. wheat producers in global trade markets, pressuring world and U.S. wheat prices.

Meanwhile, modest growth in U.S. meat production in 2020, coupled with an expectation tightening global meat protein markets due to African Swine Fever in China, lead to improved livestock prices. Some of those price improvements, in hogs in particular, were influenced by the possibility of a trade deal with China.

How do we forecast the markets for crops that in large part haven’t yet even been planted? The answer is to focus on the information we have and make several important assumptions about future developments that are currently unknowable.

For example, weather is a critical determinant of crop yields, but at this stage in the year, it is impossible to know how the weather will turn out during the critical phases of the growing season. So, we assume “normal” weather and yields that follow long-term trends reflecting technological progress and historic productivity growth. Similarly, because we can’t predict future changes in government policy that might affect markets—such as the outcome of trade agreements under negotiation—we assume the current policies remain in place and leave policy speculation to other analysts and commodity traders.

Projected U.S. crop acreage is based on the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Prospective Plantings report that was released March 29, which provides the results of a nationally representative farmer survey of their crop acreage intentions for 2019. Ending stocks for the current crop year carry over as beginning stocks for the upcoming crop year. And since agricultural markets are global, production underway in other parts of the world—such as the southern hemisphere—provides critical insight into the prospective global supply and demand conditions—and ultimately the prices—U.S. farmers might face during the growing season and into harvest. For example, this month we looked closely at the 2018/19 second crop corn production in Brazil that will begin harvest in earnest in June and offers early competition to our own corn harvest that will get underway in the fall. Meteorological data suggests that the early-planted Brazilian crop has also benefited from abundant rainfall into May across the primary growing areas in the central-western regions. Satellite imagery, along with on-the-ground reporting, supports this assessment.

So, our first look at the upcoming marketing year is complete. From now until this crop is fully planted, harvested, and ultimately sold well into 2020, we will continue to update our estimates to incorporate all of the new and unfolding information we have about production, demand, prices, and global competition. And, one thing we know for certain is to expect the unexpected. Unanticipated weather events in the United States and around the globe, policy developments that affect global trade patterns, and truly unusual events like the spread of African Swine Fever in China, can each have profound implications for the global commodity markets in which U.S. farmers operate. The dedicated members of the ICECs who contribute to each month’s WASDE report will continue to monitor such events, and we eagerly await to see what developments arise in the months to come that today may not appear on anyone’s radar."

Like other organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos has been linked to damaging and often irreversible health outcomes in workers, pregnant women, and children. A widely used pesticide, agriculture companies annually spray six million pounds on crops like citrus, apples, and cherries. In the same family as Sarin gas, the substance was initially developed prior to World War II as a chemical weapon. It can overstimulate the nervous system to cause nausea, dizziness, and confusion. With very high exposures (accidents or spills), it can cause respiratory paralysis and even death. When applying the chemical to fields, workers must wear protective garments such as respirators. Workers are then blocked from entering the fields from 24 hours up to 5 days after application due to the chemical exposure risk.

A group of leading toxics experts, who published a paper in the journal PLOS Medicine on their research on organophosphate exposure during pregnancy and impacts on child development, are calling for a ban on organophosphate pesticides. The study evaluates current science on the risks of this class of compounds, produced by Corteva Agriscience (formerly Dow AgroSciences). Its conclusions warn of the multitude of dangers of organophosphates for children, and makes recommendations for addressing these risks. The experts conclude that: (1) widespread use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides to control insects has resulted in ubiquitous human exposures; (2) acute exposures to OPs is responsible for poisonings and deaths, particularly in developing countries; and (3) evidence demonstrates that prenatal exposures, even at low levels, put children at risk for cognitive and behavioral deficits, and for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Organic production is now a $45.2 billion enterprise and provides a viable alternative to the use of toxic pesticides. In addition to banning organophosphates, states should promote organic agriculture by providing assistance for transitioning farmers and requiring organic management on all state-owned land.

Mueller Report's obstruction of justice section like a 'law school exam' answer: former DOJ official,https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-reports-obstruction-justice-doj-official,"A former top DOJ official criticized part of Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report, saying that one section looked ""like the answer to a law school exam.""

Former Deputy Director of Public Affairs Ian Prior said the second section, detailing the results of the probe into whether President Trump obstructed justice, ""surprised"" him.

""I was surprised when I read that 'part two' of the Mueller report,"" Prior said, reacting to a clip from Barr's interview with Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer.

BILL BARR REVEALS RUSSIA PROBE REVIEW TO FOCUS ON TRUMP DOSSIER BRIEFING, LEAKING

""It is almost a little bit like a recitation of what happened with [former FBI Director James] Comey and the Hillary Clinton investigation,"" Prior said on ""America's Newsroom.""

Prior recalled how Comey held a press conference in July 2016 to speak about the Clinton email investigation.

He said Mueller similarly gave a ""laundry list of facts and evidence"" in the obstruction of justice half of his investigation into Trump, but stopped short of offering an ""indictment or... a conclusion.""

Prior pointed to Attorney General William Barr telling host Bill Hemmer that he was ""surprised"" that Mueller's report offered no recommendation on the charge of obstruction.

MUELLER FILES SHOW FLYNN UNDER INVESTIGATION EARLIER THAN THOUGHT, AS BROTHER ALLEGES EFFORT TO 'TRAP HIM'

Barr said he later discussed the development with Mueller, and that the explanation he offered is ""pretty much reflected in the report.""

""At the end of the day you don't have an indictment or you don't have a conclusion and Ultimately that's not a prosecutor's job,"" Prior said. ""I think what you saw from Barr was with somebody that probably was a little bit perturbed that Mueller didn't come to a conclusion on that, and passed the hot potato over to the attorney general."""
