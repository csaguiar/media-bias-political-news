Trump blames Obama administration for bad White House air conditioning,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-obama-administration-white-house-air-conditioning,"President Trump has blamed predecessor Barack Obama for a litany of issues, from the Iran nuclear deal to the crisis at the border, and on Friday he added the alleged poor state of air conditioning in the White House to that list.

Trump made the remarks to reporters in the Oval Office, when discussing how he was going to his residence in Bedminster, N.J. in August. He said that such trips aren’t a vacation and that presidential away days are often used for maintenance on the White House.

“I'd rather be right here,” he said, before adding that “a lot of times you go and they do a lot of work in the White House.”

“For instance, the Obama administration worked out a brand new air conditioning system for the West Wing and it was so good before they did the system,” he said.

“Now that they did this system it's freezing or hot in here,” he complained

It’s common for presidents to blame their predecessors for problems plaguing the country, but this might be the first time the climate in the White House has been brought up by a presidential successor.

Trump mentioned Obama a few times during the lengthy back-and-forth with reporters. He said that now the U.S. has “a much better economy than in his wildest dreams.”

In relation to the Russia investigation and this week’s hearing involving former FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller, he mentioned Obama’s book deal as something investigators should look into in response to what he called Democrats’ “fishing.”

“It's a disgrace. We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president. Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day one,” he said. “They've looked into everything that we've done.”

“They could look into the book deal that President Obama made. Let's subpoena all of his records,” he said.

Donald Trump's most catastrophic decision,https://www.cnn.com,['David A. Andelman'],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/27/opinions/donald-trumps-most-catastrophic-decision-andelman/index.html,"(CNN) It's hard to single out any one event as the most cataclysmic of Donald Trump's presidency, in terms of American and global security. There was his bolting from the Iran nuclear deal (and Iran's subsequent resumption of uranium enrichment). There was baiting Kim Jong Un, followed by engagement, which will likely result in a more advanced North Korean nuclear program. Then, of course, there's the end to American participation in climate-change mitigation, not to mention a trade war with China.

But if I were to identify one event that could well have the most catastrophic results over the long term, it is Trump's ill-considered decision to ditch the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Agreement with Russia. That action will come full on Friday, August 2, when the United States, having given its six-month notice, will be out of it entirely, and the treaty utterly void. The result? Likely another unparalleled arms race, a growth in global insecurity, and a tacit license for more countries to seek nukes of their own.

At the moment it was negotiated in 1986, as explained in the book by historian and journalist Guillaume Serina that I translated from the French, "" An Impossible Dream: Reagan, Gorbachev and a World Without the Bomb ,"" the US was far better positioned for a major arms race than was the Soviet Union — a reality that both US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but especially the latter, understood. That is certainly no longer the case.

Still, there are certain constants that are as true, and perilous, today as they were then. In the 1980s, nuclear-armed missiles of various ranges were proliferating with few checks on their numbers or lethality.

Intermediate range nuclear (INF) missiles were originally based in Europe, but with the proliferation of nuclear forces in Asia, were beginning to pose a series of global and regional challenges.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were largely the domain of the United States and the Soviet Union. These were at the heart of the Cold War nuclear standoff and the often-tense peace guaranteed by the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (which held that if one side attacked, the other would respond, and both sides would be destroyed — a dynamic that deterred anyone from launching a first strike). And, of course, there was always the ultimate fear of a horrific error in judgment or technology.

So from the early 1970s into the 2000s, a succession of discussions was held between the two superpowers that led to treaties designed to put a cap on the numbers and lethality of these weapons that both sides recognized were the surest path to Armageddon. SALT I and SALT II (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks), signed in 1972 and 1979, placed caps on the numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

That still left, largely unrestrained, all intermediate range (INF) missiles, based in Europe and the Soviet Union. This was the goal of the summit held in Reykjavik, Iceland, between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1986, when the Soviet leader sprang on an astonished US president a proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons held by both sides. The catch? Reagan would have to end his ""Star Wars"" missile-defense system. He refused. The meeting ended with no agreement. Still, it was a landmark moment — the closest the world has ever approached to an end to all nuclear arms.

But neither side was prepared to give up. The discussions that began in Reykjavik led to other, more modest but enduring nuclear pacts, along two tracks that have stood the test of time. The most immediate result of Reykjavik was the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed December 8, 1987, whose provisions eliminated all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. But its precedent-shattering provision was an intrusive system of on-site inspections, laying the groundwork for verification of new ICBM treaties — the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I, which arrived seven years later, and New C, which exists today. These slashed the number of deployed nuclear warheads from 6,000 under START I to 1,550 today.

While neither has managed to prevent the slow and equally destabilizing arrival of new nuclear powers (China, India, Pakistan, Israel, eventually North Korea, and possibly someday Iran), both sets of treaties — Start and INF — have very much stood the test of time. Until now.

Last fall, Trump, who arrived with his tortured sense of East-West rivalry and American supremacy, suddenly and arbitrarily announced his intention to pull out of the centerpiece of the nuclear-arms-control process launched in the 1980s: the INF Treaty. When Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the INF treaty after the six-month window that ends August 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the opportunity to bolt from the treaty, too. Each side charged the other with violations — and with some justification. The problem is that Trump may not have recognized that today's Russia is quite different from Gorbachev's.

In February, Putin outlined the shape of this new world in his annual state-of-the-nation address. Behind him flashed video and animations of next-generation ICBMs, nuclear-powered hypersonic cruise missiles, underwater drones and other devices Russia had developed and that it now felt free to deploy. ""The capability of such weapons,"" he warned, ""will be equivalent to the threats against Russia.""

Indeed, with communism dead, the new proto-capitalist Russia, supported by high oil prices, is a more formidable enemy by far and, as Putin suggested, in a position to make good on threats once viewed as largely empty bluster from his Kremlin predecessors. The US is developing similar weapons, including hypersonic weapons able to travel nine times the speed of sound and largely impervious to any existing missile defense systems. American officials have conceded, however, that, while working diligently on such advances, the US is years away from testing and deployment, while Putin has at least claimed Russia will make its first deployments this year.

Despite all of Trump's braggadocio of ""rebuilding our military like we never have before,"" the US seems suddenly to find itself in the deeply uncomfortable and unprecedented position of playing catchup in an arms race where Russia could begin calling the shots.

At the same time, it leaves America's closest allies questioning the value of counting on a nuclear security umbrella controlled by the US, which has suddenly become an unpredictable and irrational partner, and whose leadership appears to be in disturbing agreement with their most pernicious enemy — Russia. It is little wonder that European leaders are moving toward creation of a European defense force. Once lost, the lead in any arms contest is only regained with enormous difficulty and at colossal cost.

Eliminating constraints on nuclear weapons is in no way a path toward a safer, more tranquil world. It is a path toward an unchecked arms race that is likely to suggest to any number of other nuclear aspirants that they need to field deterrent nuclear arsenals of their own. And from there, nuclear weapons would need to take only one small step to reach the hands of terrorists who know no restraints and care nothing of consequences.

The US still spends much more than any other country on weapons, but for the sake of our own security, we cannot afford an arms race with today's Russia. Nor can the world afford the decades it takes to negotiate any replacements to these treaties so hastily scrapped in such ill-conceived fashion.

Former Miss Michigan Kathy Zhu joins Trump campaign after ouster over 'offensive' social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kathy-zhu-ex-miss-michigan-trump-campaign,"Kathy Zhu has landed on her feet after losing her title as ""Miss Michigan,"" taking a position on the ""Women for Trump Coalition Advisory Board"".

""[Zhu] is a patriot who has continued to stand for American values despite being stripped of her crown,' the Trump campaign tweeted on Thursday.

The announcement came shortly after Zhu, a University of Michigan student and president of her campus' College Republicans chapter, posted about the Miss World America pageant's decision to strip her of her title.

TODD STARNES: PRO-TRUMP BEAUTY QUEEN DETHRONED OVER LOVE FOR COPS, COUNTRY -- MAGA HATE IS AN UGLY THING

""Miss World America's State/National/Chief Director accused me of being racist, Islamaphobic, and insensitive,"" Zhu tweeted earlier in July. The pageant had apparently seen social media posts about her aversion to hijabs and statistics on crime in the African American community.

The termination letter, which Zhu posted on her Twitter timeline, claimed she violated the pageant's requirement to be ""of good character and ... not likely to disrepute Miss World America or any person associated with the organization.""

Since the letter, Zhu has been outspoken about the incident, indicating that the pageant overlooked critical context surrounding her posts. She also stood by her statements and pushed back on the idea of beauty pageants disqualifying contestants because of their opinions.

“Everything that I’ve posted was my statistics and opinions, and I think that we should be empowering women’s voices and not just stripping them of their title only because of their opinions,” she said during an interview with CNN.

Zhu, 20, has also been bold in her support of the president, tweeting supportive posts and criticizing high-profile Democrats.

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Kagan: Congrats to Sprint and T-Mobile on merger. What’s next?,https://www.rcrwireless.com,['Jeff Kagan'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190726/opinion/kagan-sprint-t-mobile-2,"Congratulations to T-Mobile US and Sprint on finally getting DoJ merger approval. This has been one helluva ride, and it’s not over yet, but we are closer than ever. Now that the deal is done, what comes next? Let’s take a closer look at what we can expect going forward in the wireless industry.

This deal is just one slice of the pie when it comes to changes in the U.S. wireless marketplace. It used to be an industry full of wireless carriers like AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile and Sprint.

Over recent years we have seen other industries move into wireless and changing things. Think of companies like Comcast with Xfinity Mobile, Charter with Spectrum Mobile and Altice with Altice Mobile.

The wireless industry continues to change

Things are continuing to change. We have seen other companies like Amazon and Facebook try to enter wireless and fail. I think we can expect them and other companies to make another try.

DISH Network is a sudden newcomer to the wireless industry. Like DirecTV which was acquired by AT&T along with Time Warner or WarnerMedia, DISH sees the writing on the wall. With the entry of Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile and Altice Mobile is it becoming obvious if DISH wants to remain a player going forward, they must enter wireless.

Several years ago, DISH acquired wireless spectrum and they must use it or lose it. Since this is a real threat, and since other pay TV companies are also in the wireless business, it makes sense they acquire some of T-Mobile and Sprint wireless assets.

That way T-Mobile and Sprint win since they can complete their merger and DISH also wins, since they can now rapidly move into wireless. We will now watch and see how quickly they will move into the mobile space.

So, the next question is will DISH light off a huge firework display of rapid wireless innovation and growth or will they take a more gentile approach like Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile?

During the early days there was much speculation about Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile. Would they rapidly grow? Would they be a fierce competitor?

Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile not fierce competitor in wireless

Watching them over the last few years the answer is they are not a real competitive threat to traditional wireless competitors like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.

Rather, they are just using wireless as a defensive play, not an offensive one. They are using wireless as another leg on their stool hoping to hang onto their existing customer base. They are not really marketing this service like traditional wireless services have always done.

With that said, I would think when Altice Mobile launches, it will not be a major competitor either. And since these three pay TV companies are not using wireless as a growth engine, perhaps DISH will not either.

Wireless going through major transformation

Wireless is going through a major transformation and that will continue for years to come. Today, it looks like current leaders, AT&T and Verizon will remain in the leadership position going forward.

With this merger, T-Mobile and Sprint look stronger than ever. Finally, they have wireless spectrum and marketing power. They should remain a strong third-place competitor.

DISH is the next big question mark. Will they become a hot competitor to the big players, or will they take a more gentile approach like Xfinity and Spectrum?

This wireless industry transformation is still in the very early stages. At this point, this merger only really impacts T-Mobile and Sprint. The real action comes from where 5G will take this entire industry for years to come.

Other industries will use 5G to rapidly grow and transform life as we know it. Think of wireless pay TV. Think of wireless self-driving cars. Think of all the amazing new technology that has already come our way like Uber and Lyft and much more. Think of what tomorrow will look like on the 5G networks which have only just begun.

Wireless will continue to rapidly grow and change. Expect other companies in other industries to use wireless to grow in new ways. This is one of the most exciting times we have ever experienced, and we are just in the very early stages of this movie.

So, once again, congratulations to T-Mobile and Sprint. You now have the wireless spectrum and the marketing power to show growth as this industry moves into 5G. We’ll be watching all the fireworks and excitement."
DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

Justice Department Settles with T-Mobile and Sprint in Their Proposed Merger by Requiring a Package of Divestitures to Dish

Divestiture Will Enable DISH’s Entry as a Fourth Nationwide Facilities-Based Wireless Competitor and Expedite Deployment of High-Quality 5G for American Consumers

The Department of Justice announced today that it and the Attorneys General for five states reached a settlement with T-Mobile and Sprint regarding their proposed merger. The settlement requires a substantial divestiture package in order to enable a viable facilities-based competitor to enter the market. Further, the settlement will facilitate the expeditious deployment of multiple high-quality 5G networks for the benefit of American consumers and entrepreneurs.

The Department’s Antitrust Division, along with the offices of five state Attorneys General (Plaintiff States), filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed transaction. At the same time, the Department and the Plaintiff States filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Department’s and the Plaintiff States’ competitive concerns. The participating state Attorneys General offices represent Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

Under the terms of the proposed settlement, T-Mobile and Sprint must divest Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint prepaid, to Dish Network Corp., a Colorado-based satellite television provider. The proposed settlement also provides for the divestiture of certain spectrum assets to Dish. Additionally, T-Mobile and Sprint must make available to Dish at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. T-Mobile must also provide Dish with robust access to the T-Mobile network for a period of seven years while Dish builds out its own 5G network.

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amounts of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “Today’s settlement will provide Dish with the assets and transitional services required to become a facilities-based mobile network operator that can provide a full range of mobile wireless services nationwide. I want to thank our state partners for joining us in this settlement.” Delrahim added, “In crafting this remedy, we are also mindful of the significant commitments T-Mobile, Sprint, and Dish have made to the Federal Communications Commission.”

The Department and the Plaintiff States said that, without the divestiture, the proposed acquisition would eliminate competition between two of only four facilities-based suppliers of nationwide mobile wireless services. According to the complaint, T-Mobile and Sprint both operate mobile networks and offer nationwide coverage to consumers, and they are particularly close competitors to each other for the roughly 30% of retail subscribers who purchase prepaid mobile wireless service. The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint would eliminate head-to-head competition between the companies and threaten the benefits that customers have realized from that competition in the form of lower prices and better service.

T-Mobile US Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. In 2018, T-Mobile posted revenues of more than $43 billion. Deutsche Telekom AG, a German corporation headquartered in Bonn, Germany, is the controlling shareholder of T-Mobile US Inc.

Sprint Corporation is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. In 2018, its posted revenue was over $32 billion. Sprint is controlled by SoftBank Group Corp., a Japanese Corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

As required by the Tunney Act, the proposed consent decree, along with the Department’s competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days of its publication to Scott Scheele, Chief, Telecommunications and Broadband Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Suite 7000, Washington, D.C. 20530. At the conclusion of the 60-day comment period, the court may enter the final judgment upon a finding that it serves the public interest."
Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""

John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

"Amazon has 'destroyed the retail industry' in the US, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says (AMZN)",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Finanzen.Net Gmbh'],,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/mnuchin-comments-on-amazon-says-theyve-destroyed-us-retail-industry-2019-7,"Reuters

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday that Amazon had ""destroyed"" the US retail industry.

The comments followed the Justice Department's Tuesday announcement that it had begun an investigation into whether ""market-leading online platforms"" harmfully weaken competition.

It's believed the investigation will focus on Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among other tech companies.

Watch Amazon trade live here.

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin criticized Amazon on Wednesday, saying during a CNBC interview that the e-commerce giant had ""destroyed"" America's retail industry.

""If you look at Amazon, although there are certain benefits to it, they've destroyed the retail industry across the United States, so there's no question they've limited competition,"" Mnuchin said.

The comments followed the Justice Department's announcement on Tuesday that it had launched an investigation into whether a handful of ""market-leading online platforms"" unlawfully dominate their respective sectors. It's widely believed the companies under investigation include Amazon, Facebook, and Google's parent, Alphabet.

""There's areas where they've really hurt small businesses, so I don't think this is a one-size-fits-all,"" Mnuchin said of Amazon. ""And I don't have an opinion going in other than I think it's absolutely right that the attorney general is looking into these issues, and I look forward to listening to his recommendations to the president.""

The investigation is separate from potential antitrust inquiries involving tech giants including Apple, Google, and Facebook.

"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says",https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-says-bitcoin-escrow-firm-bilked-investors-for-7-million,"U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

Illinois EPA cites company for south suburban water woes,https://wgntv.com,"['Ben Bradley', 'Joe Donlon', 'Wgn Investigates']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://wgntv.com/2019/07/26/illinois-epa-cites-company-for-south-suburban-water-woes/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

UNIVERSITY PARK, Ill. — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has hit a private water provider with notice of several violations after high lead levels were detected in several south suburbs. Aqua Illinois first notified its customers in University Park, Green Garden and Monee Township about high lead levels on June 14. Nearly six weeks later, 1,500 households remain under a “do not consume” advisory.

Aqua Illinois officials have blamed the spike in lead levels to a change in the chemicals it uses to treat the water. The Illinois EPA now says the company failed to obtain the necessary permits to make those changes, a violation of IEPA rules.

State regulators also fault Aqua Illinois for failing to properly monitor and report water quality test results last year.

""Your supply did not collect the required number of sample results from a certified laboratory,” the IEPA violation notice reads. All required lead and copper samples were not collected for the July-December 2018 monitoring period in University Park, according to the IEPA.

Aqua Illinois denies any alleged violations contributed to the lead problem or the difficulty in solving it. “We don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park,” the company wrote in a statement.

University Park mayor Joseph Roudez has previously criticized the private water provider for not providing the community with water quality reports prior to June.

Aqua Illinois revealed Friday that it has suspended four members of its management and professional team while the company examined the details of the IEPA’s findings.

University Park officials say they were led to believe the problem would be resolved within several days, a claim Aqua Illinois disputes. The water crisis in these south suburban communities is now in its second month.

“It could take several months before this is resolved,” Aqua Illinois president Craig Blanchette told WGN’s Joe Donlon.

In the most recent community update posted July 22, Aqua Illinois officials said “water lead test results in University Park have fluctuated, both increasing an decreasing in some areas. It’s not unusual to see this fluctuation, particularly in the first few months of treatment.”

“We acknowledge that while we all would have hoped to see treatment showing progress, it hasn’t had enough time yet,” reads a statement on Aqua Illinois’ website for residents effected by the water problems.

Aqua Illinois officials insist older homes impacted by the high lead levels will see their numbers subside when residents let water run for 2-3 minutes first thing in the morning. They’ve provided residents with filters and bottled water.

Blanchette provided WGN with the following statement:

""Aqua Illinois is committed to operating with complete transparency with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We have been working closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators since we issued the voluntary do not consume advisory June 14, and immediately launched an internal investigation. To date, we have identified the likely cause of elevated lead levels in a limited number of homes is due to water chemistry interacting with lead solder in the internal plumbing of homes built prior to 1990. (Lead solder was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1986). As part of our commitment to resolve this situation, we have engaged nationally renowned experts in this field to complement our team’s efforts. Related Story

Hundreds attend emergency meeting on water lead levels in south suburbs Aqua Illinois leadership makes every effort to comply with all federal and state regulations. We recently learned that IEPA has issued several regulatory violations relating to permitting and sampling. Although we continue working to gather the necessary information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what took place, it is important to note we don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park. We want our customers to know that we take these actions very seriously and are actively working with the IEPA on a resolution. Among the matters raised by the IEPA are permitting actions that took place in 2018. Aqua Illinois has since addressed these issues. During the process to change sources from well water to the Kankakee River, we installed a water main and changed treatment locations prior to receiving an IEPA permit. Though the changes were made prior to receiving the permits, the IEPA ultimately did issue the permits. The delay in applying for the permits, though it was eventually approved by the IEPA in 2018, was an oversight on our part. To correct this process, effective immediately, we have updated internal permit management practices to strengthen oversight of our permitting activities. The other issues raised by the IEPA involve the method of selecting sampling locations during the second half of 2018. Based upon our own investigation, we learned, and proactively advised the IEPA, that several homes selected for compliance sampling did not meet the proper criteria due to the age of the homes. We have addressed this issue, adding about 40 pre-1986 sampling locations to the existing sample set, thanks to the cooperation of our customers. This ensures that our lead testing correctly represents the various property types, ages, and plumbing construction in the community. As part of our holistic examination of the matter, Aqua has been and will continue to evaluate changes to processes and personnel to ensure we correct this situation and continue to improve our service for our customers and communities. As part of this process, Aqua has taken immediate action by suspending four members of the Aqua Illinois management and professional team while we thoroughly examine all the details around the IEPA’s findings. As a company, we collectively work each day with integrity, respect and in the pursuit of excellence in all we do, and we are accountable when we fall short of those values. The safety of our system is our top priority. We will continue to work with regulators, our own team and national water experts to restore and maintain safe drinking water for our customers."""

The House had rebuked the Trump Cabinet members by passing a criminal contempt resolution earlier this month, largely along party lines. However, it was widely presumed that the Justice Department would not pursue a criminal referral against the top DOJ official.

The full House vote came after the House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed the Commerce and Justice departments earlier this year for documents relating to since-abandoned efforts to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The panel voted largely along party lines last month to hold Barr and Ross in contempt for failing to comply with those subpoenas.

The matter was challenged in several federal courts, and the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last month that the question couldn’t be added to the census under the administration's rationale that it would help to enforce the Voting Rights Act, reasoning the high court called ""contrived.""

While Trump initially signaled that he would still try to get the question on next year’s census, he ultimately gave up the effort. He instead announced an executive order directing federal agencies to provide information on citizenship to the Commerce Department."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced bill to block death penalty after DOJ reinstates capital punishment,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/politics/pressley-abolish-death-penalty-bill/index.html,"(CNN) Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced a bill Thursday that would abolish the death penalty after the Justice Department ordered federal capital punishment to be reinstated for the first time in nearly two decades.

The proposed legislation would ""prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any violation of Federal law, and for other purposes,"" according to an image of the bill that Pressley shared on Twitter.

Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, brought the bill to the House on the same day that Attorney General William Barr directed the Justice Department to resume using the death penalty and the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the execution of five inmates after adopting an updated execution protocol.

After 16 years without an execution, Barr on Thursday ordered the executions of "" five death-row inmates convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly"" in December and January, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.

The move represents a dramatic reversal after more than a decade-long hiatus in the federal use of capital punishment, as President Donald Trump has taken on the issue and called to ""bring back the death penalty."" The death penalty is legal in 29 states and the federal government, though there have been no federal executions since 2003 and the number of people facing state executions has been on the decline.

Supreme Court clears way for Trump to use Defense Dept. funds for border wall,https://fox59.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://fox59.com/2019/07/26/supreme-court-clears-way-for-trump-to-use-defense-dept-funds-for-border-wall/,"WASHINGTON D.C. (CNN) — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct parts of a wall along the southwestern border that the government argues is necessary to protect national security.

The decision allows the Defense Department money to be spent now while a court battle plays out over whether the government had the authority to divert funds that were not appropriated for the wall. The Supreme Court voted 5-4, along ideological lines, to allow the funds to be used while the court appeals proceed.

In a brief order, the court said that it was ruling in favor of the Trump administration before the litigation has played out because the government had made a “sufficient showing” that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.

Three members of the liberal wing of the court — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — wrote they would have blocked the funds for now. The fourth member, Justice Stephen Breyer, wrote separately to say that he would have allowed the government to use the funds to finalize the terms for contractors but block the funds from being used for the actual construction.

The Supreme Court’s order is a significant win for Trump, who is likely to use the construction of a wall as a major talking point on the campaign trail. The President celebrated the decision in a tweet Friday evening.

“The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed,” the President tweeted. “Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!”

The decision overrules a lower court decision that had blocked the transfer of funds while appeals played out. A panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to allow the use of the funds earlier in the month, holding that the challengers were likely to prevail in their case because the use of the funds “violates the constitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.”

The order comes after Trump ended a 35-day government shutdown in February when Congress gave him $1.4 billion in wall funding, far less than he had sought. He subsequently declared a national emergency to get money from other government accounts to construct sections of the wall.

The $2.5 billion had been shifted from various programs including personnel and recruiting, Minuteman III and air launch cruise missiles, E-3 aircraft upgrades and the Afghan security forces training fund. The Pentagon said it was able to move that money due to uncovered cost savings as part of a process known as “reprogramming.” The money was moved into a Defense Department counter-drug account that is authorized to spend money on the construction of border barriers.

Many lawmakers slammed the decision to move the money away from those national security priorities, threatening to strip the Pentagon of its ability to move money around, something the Defense Department has acknowledged would be detrimental.

Lawyers for the government had asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis and unblock the use of the funds while legal challenges proceed in the lower courts.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco noted in court papers that the projects needed to start because the funds at issue “will no longer remain available for obligation after the fiscal year ends on September 30, 2019.” He said that the funds are necessary to permit the construction of more than 100 miles of fencing in areas the government has identified as “drug-smuggling corridors” where it has seized “thousands of pounds of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine” in recent years.

“Respondents’ interests in hiking, birdwatching, and fishing in designated drug-smuggling corridors do not outweigh the harm to the public from halting the government’s efforts to construct barriers to stanch the flow of illegal narcotics across the southern border,” Francisco argued in the papers, regarding the challenge from environmental groups.

It is a loss for critics, including the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition that argued the administration had illegally transferred the funds after Congress denied requests for more money to construct the wall. The groups argued the wall — in areas in Arizona, California and New Mexico — would harm the environment.

The ACLU, representing the groups, argued in court papers against a stay of the lower court ruling fearful of the wall’s impact on border communities.

“Issuance of a stay that would permit Defendants to immediately spend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with the tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public interest,”ACLU lawyers told the court.

The ACLU slammed the decision after it was released Friday evening.

“This is not over. We will be asking the federal appeals court to expedite the ongoing appeals proceeding to halt the irreversible and imminent damage from Trump’s border wall. Border communities, the environment, and our Constitution’s separation of powers will be permanently harmed should Trump get away with pillaging military funds for a xenophobic border wall Congress denied,” said Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project."

Visual: Tami A. Heilemann/U.S. Department of the Interior

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients. The pair urged EPA officials not to “abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

• An unprecedented and lethal heatwave swept across Europe this week, breaking records in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom. As of Friday morning, French authorities reported at least five deaths linked to the rising temperatures. There, temperatures topped 108 degrees Fahrenheit; in Germany, 106.7 degrees; Belgium 105 degrees; and in the Netherlands, 104 degrees. The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing. If successful, LightSail 2 will be the first steerable solar sail to orbit Earth.

Carter']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.channel3000.com/news/national-news/lawyer-us-citizen-detained-by-ice-lost-dozens-of-pounds-didnt-shower/1099960838,"Sanjuana Galicia from Facebook via CNN Francisco Galicia, who was born in Dallas and is a US citizen, was released from ICE custody on Tuesday after spending three weeks behind bars, his lawyer told CNN.

Sanjuana Galicia from Facebook via CNN Francisco Galicia, who was born in Dallas and is a US citizen, was released from ICE custody on Tuesday after spending three weeks behind bars, his lawyer told CNN.

The Texas-born high school student who was detained by immigration officials for more than three weeks told CNN Thursday he was treated less than human at a US Customs and Border Protection facility.

Francisco Galicia, 18, says he was held in filthy, overcrowded conditions where he was not allowed to shower for 23 days, forced to sleep on a cement floor and not given enough food. By the time he was released Tuesday, after word spread about his detention following a report by The Dallas Morning News, he said he was malnourished, having dropped 26 pounds.

""They were not treating us humanely,"" Galicia told CNN during a wide-ranging interview. ""...The stress was so high, they (detention center agents) were on me all the time. It was like psychological torture to the point where I almost (agreed to be deported). I felt safer to be in the cell than to be with the officers. ""

'They threatened me with charges'

The problem began, he says, on June 27 while he was on his way to a college soccer scouting event.

He was traveling with his 17-year-old brother Marlon, as well as a group of friends, from his hometown of Edinburg to Houston when they were stopped at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias, about 100 miles north of the US-Mexico border.

Francisco Galicia was born in Texas, and he is an American citizen. As a child, he moved to Mexico with his family and later returned to the US as a teenager. He says he was carrying his state ID, a Social Security card and a wallet-sized birth certificate.

He also had a Mexican tourist visa with him that inaccurately listed his country of birth as Mexico, setting up a conflicting nationality claim, his attorney, Claudia Galan, said.

Both brothers were detained, and Marlon Galicia, who does not have legal status in the US, was retuned to Mexico. Francisco Galicia was sent to an immigration detention center.

""They didn't believe me. I kept telling them over and over, and they kept saying my documents were fake, and they were going to deport me,"" Galicia said. ""...They threatened me with charges -- charges about falsifying documents. Felonies. They kept asking how it was possible for me to not know where I was from. I almost signed (to be deported) because I didn't want to suffer there anymore. ""

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials declined a CNN request for comment on Galicia's allegations and pointed back to a joint ICE-CBP statement on Wednesday following the teen's release.

""This individual provided conflicting reports regarding status of citizenship after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol and transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody,"" the statement said.

The statement continued, ""Situations including conflicting reports from the individual and multiple birth certificates can, and should, take more time to verify. While we continue to research the facts of the situation, the individual has been released from ICE custody.""

'You have no rights'

Galicia said he was not allowed to call his family or an attorney while he was detained.

""The moment I got there, we told them we have the right to a phone call and to a lawyer, and they told us, 'you have no rights,'"" he said.

Galicia described squalid conditions in the facility where he was held, saying he was held in a small room with about 70 other people. There was one toilet, with no doors or wall.

Every few days, he said, he and those held with him were given wipes.

""It was to clean up but the dirt, but you couldn't get rid of it because so much time had passed since we showered,"" he said.

Galicia dismissed President Donald Trump's assertion that many of the people crossing the border are ""bad actors,"" who mean to do harm to the US and its people. He said the people he met who were being held with him at the facility meant no harm.

""They just wanted to come for a better future. They were fleeing their countries because they were being threatened or kidnapped,"" he said.

Attorney says she was given the runaround

While Galicia was being held, an attorney retained by his family said she tried for a least a week to get in touch with the teen while he was being held but was given the runaround by CBP and ICE.

Galan says she tried in vain for at least a week to get in touch with Galicia while he was being held, but was given the runaround by Border Patrol.

""They told him he had no right to an attorney,"" Galan said. ""Once I went to border patrol headquarters, they told me the same thing. ... They said that I couldn't get any information until he consented, but he didn't even know I was trying to get him out.""

Galan has said she shared documents two weeks ago with CBP proving Galicia was a US citizen -- including a birth certificate showing he was born in Dallas.

Despite the documentation, the attorney said, Galicia was transferred on Saturday to ICE custody for removal proceedings. He was held in the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall until his release Tuesday.

By the time he was released, he had been detained for 27 days: one day at the border patrol checkpoint, 23 days at the Falfurrias processing center and three days in Pearsall.

'I am the eyes and the ears of what's happening'

Galicia showed CNN pieces of paper that he said contained phone numbers of the families of those held with him.

""They asked me to reach out to them to let them know that they're OK. They didn't want me to tell them about the conditions in the detention centers -- they only wanted me to tell them that they were OK,"" he said.

""...Right now, I'm in a place where I can help those who are still in there -- so people can see how they're treated, and change the way they're treated. I am the eyes and ears of what's happening in there. I can talk. They can't do what I'm doing. ""

Galicia says he doesn't know if he will take legal action against the CBP, but he does want a measure of justice.

He said he remains a positive person despite being treated so badly.

""It's made me stronger,"" he said. ""I see life differently after seeing how other people have been suffering. It's made me understand many things like how you can live your life while others are suffering.""

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

Controversial MP Nadine Dorries has been made a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Health and Social Care.

The appointment is likely to put her previous positions on abortions under scrutiny, after the longtime backbencher led calls in 2006 to cut the time limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 21, while more recently she attempted to amend laws and strip abortion providers of their role in counselling women.

She has also proposed introducing compulsory sex education lessons at schools for teenage girls which espoused the benefits of abstinence.

Last year, journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown accused the MP for Mid Bedfordshire of racism after she told her to “appreciate just a little the country and the people you have chosen to live, work and benefit from all of your life”.

Dorries has also been criticised for sharing a tweet by Tommy Robinson, and was accused of Islamophobia for suggesting the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, was responsible for dealing with grooming gangs in Yorkshire.

Meanwhile, Zac Goldsmith has been appointed as a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for International Development.

Goldsmith has campaigned against the expansion of Heathrow and is well known as a keen environmentalist. Last year, he warned ministers that their plans to fast-track fracking could spark a backlash and turn whole regions of the UK against the Tories, after criticising government proposals to forego local planning decisions on shale gas wells.

However, he was accused of exploiting anti-Muslim prejudices during his campaign against Khan to become mayor of London in 2016. Goldsmith denied employing “dog-whistle” politics during the election.

In other ministerial appointments, Luke Hall has become a parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

"The DOJ's latest probe erased $33 billion from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Finanzen.Net Gmbh'],,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-apple-facebook-and-google-shares-doj-antitrust-2019-7,"BI Graphics/Skye Gould

The share prices of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have fallen since the US Department of Justice announced an antitrust investigation into ""online platforms.""

As of 5:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, about $33 billion was wiped off the value of these big tech firms in premarket trading.

Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the DOJ's investigation would be an ""overhang"" on stocks.

Visit Markets Insider's homepage for more stories.

Billions of dollars are set to be wiped from the value of America's biggest tech firms after the US Department of Justice took the unusual step of announcing an antitrust investigation.

The DOJ on Tuesday said it was launching a broad investigation into whether ""online platforms"" were illegally harming their competitors and stifling innovation.

In a press release, the Justice Department did not name names but said it would focus on ""market-leading"" companies, meaning it is likely to encompass Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.

The share prices of those four companies took a hit in after-hours trading Tuesday, and the losses continued into premarket trading on Wednesday morning. Here's how things stood at 5:30 a.m. ET:

Alphabet : Down 0.96%, wiping $7.6 billion off its value

: Down 0.96%, wiping $7.6 billion off its value Amazon : Down 1%, a $9.8 billion hit to its market cap

: Down 1%, a $9.8 billion hit to its market cap Apple : Down 1.04%, a $6.8 billion drop in value

: Down 1.04%, a $6.8 billion drop in value Facebook: Down 1.46%, erasing $8.4 billion in value

Put together, the losses represent around $33 billion of lost value for the tech companies. That's roughly equal to the gross domestic product of Zimbabwe, according to the World Bank.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been agitating for an investigation into the power of the tech companies, and President Donald Trump has long hinted that he shares these concerns.

He has said Google, Amazon, and Facebook might be ""very antitrust,"" and he has repeatedly attacked against Google over unproven claims it shows bias against conservatives.

Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the DOJ's investigation represented a ""shot across the bow"" for big tech but was unlikely to result in drastic action. He added, however, that it could be an ""overhang on the stocks"" and said investors should focus on the fundamentals of the firms involved."
US: Unlicensed Bitcoin Exchange Operator Indicted by Justice Department,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Tom Gilchrist']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-unlicensed-bitcoin-exchange-operator-indicted-by-justice-department,"William Green, a 46-year-old New Jersey resident, was indicted by a federal grand jury on account of allegedly running an unlicensed money transmission service. The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."
"DOJ's T-Mobile-Sprint Settlement Gets Claps, Slaps in D.C.",https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/dojs-t-mobile-sprint-settlement-gets-claps-slaps-in-d-c,"Industry players were ready with a torrent of reaction to the Justice Department's approval Friday (July 26)--with divestitures and conditions--of the T-Mobile-Sprint deal. It must still be voted by the FCC and faces a state legal challenge from various state attorneys general.

FCC chair Ajit Pai said the deal would help close the digital divide, for example, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said what looked like a bad deal before still looked like one.

“I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Justice has reached a settlement with T-Mobile and Sprint,"" said Pai, who had already signaled he could support the meld with the spin-off of pre-paid business Boost Mobile and other conditions. ""The commitments made to the FCC by T-Mobile and Sprint to deploy a 5G network that would cover 99% of the American people, along with the measures outlined in the Department’s consent decree, will advance U.S. leadership in 5G and protect competition. In addition, the transaction has garnered bipartisan support, including from Governor Laura Kelly (D-Kan.), Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-Calif), and former FCC commissioner Mignon Clyburn.

“Because of this transaction’s potential to help close the digital divide in rural America and maintain our nation’s leadership in 5G, as well as the commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint to the FCC, I plan to present my colleagues soon with a draft order, consistent with the Department’s filings, favorably resolving the FCC’s review of the transaction.”

“I am pleased that the Department of Justice is now prepared to approve the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, albeit with conditions and divestitures that, in the current competitive communications environment, are likely not necessary to protect consumers, and which, in fact, may have the effect of reducing some of the benefits from the merger,"" said Free State Foundation president Randolph May.

“That said, DOJ’s decision after a lengthy review finally to allow the merger to be consummated is welcome. As a general matter, and in this case involving the rapidly changing communications marketplace driven by technological innovations like 5G next-generation wireless networks, it takes longer than it should for the government to reach a decision. The gap in time between due deliberation and delay often is far too large. So, I hope the FCC will quickly approve the merger, and the state Attorneys General will now withdraw their lawsuit, which has had more than a whiff of politics driving it from the get-go.""

Five state AG's joined DOJ in the settlement that paves the way for the deal, but others signaled they are pushing ahead. If so, the deal can't close until that case is resolved, which won't be until at least late October at the earliest.

Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel had her doubts.

“Today the Department of Justice gave its blessing to the largest wireless merger in history,"" she said. ""I remain skeptical that this combination is good for consumers, good for competition, or good for the economy. Before the FCC votes on this new deal, the public should have the opportunity to weigh in and comment. Too much here has been done behind closed doors.”

Deal opponent and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said the deal looked no better in the light of the spinoffs and conditions.

“Competition is critical to a strong economy—among the four largest cell phone carriers, that competition has led to lower prices, better service, and more innovation. That’s why, when this merger was first reported, I raised serious antitrust concerns about combining two of the four remaining nationwide wireless carriers, and I have since urged the Justice Department to reject the deal as anticompetitive,"" she said. ""It looked like a bad deal then, and it looks like a bad deal today, despite the parties’ promises and this proposed consent decree.”

""Consummation of this revised transaction has more obstacles than many observers seem to recognize,"" said Benton Foundation's Andrew Schwartzman. ""For one thing, even though a majority of the FCC has signaled its approval, the Commission must still issue its decision. The expected dissents from the FCC minority will provide more ammunition for opponents. Second, the new consent decree must also be approved by a federal judge. While that review has often been automatic in the past, this time the states and other opponents have already marshaled a vast array of evidence against the deal.""

“It is clear that the Justice Department agrees with what we’ve said for the past year: the wireless market needs at least four viable competitors,"" said Joshua Stager, senior counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute. ""But the agency’s response is needlessly convoluted. DOJ does not need to bend over backwards to fix a bad merger. It can simply block the deal.""

“Makan Delrahim and the Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division have upheld the competition and consumer welfare standard,"" said INCOMPAS CEO Chip Pickering. ""The DOJ agreement is great news for wireless customers, smaller providers, and fiber builders. This settlement preserves a market structure of four national carriers, unleashes a true race to new 5G, and will help rural broadband grow.

“The DOJ deal is both creative and competitive,"" he said. ""[C]onsumers get greater portability and flexibility to switch providers. By empowering Dish, the DOJ preserves a fourth national provider that will benefit consumers and open up more wholesale opportunities for smaller wireless builders. Dish is a disrupter with a long history of providing service to underserved rural Americans and is well positioned to bring more competition to more communities. Makan is to be commended and congratulated for his commitment to the law and competition.""

“Just a few months ago, reports indicated that the expert antitrust staff at the DOJ recommended the agency sue to block the T-Mobile-Sprint merger,"" said Common Cause special advisor and former FCC Chairman Michael Copps. ""But rather than take the reported advice of career staff, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim decided to approve a blatantly anticompetitive deal by bringing in Dish as a sham fourth competitor. Basic math tells you that replacing Sprint, a national carrier with 50 million subscribers, with Dish, a satellite company with zero wireless subscribers, is a recipe for competitive disaster. In addition, Dish has no wireless infrastructure of its own and has been sitting on spectrum for years without any clear plan to build a network. No type of network sharing arrangement with T-Mobile will lower wireless prices or actually force Dish to build out its own network.""

“Today’s decision reduces the number of nationwide mobile carriers from four to three, with the hope of one day creating a new fourth competitor,” said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). “Unfortunately, the best way to ensure competition would have been for the Justice Department to simply block the merger so we would still have four competitors today. Instead, they chose a more complicated and uncertain path. I plan to closely monitor this deal because we must ensure consumers have at least four choices, not three, in the wireless marketplace.”"
Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454805-interior-whistleblowers-say-agency-has-sidelined-scientists-under,"Former Interior Department employees who say they experienced retaliation at the agency for their work on scientific endeavors appeared before lawmakers Thursday, sparking political wrangling over the role of scientists in the Trump administration.

Republicans used the appearances to accuse Democrats of political theater, while Democrats in turn stepped up calls for scientists to be protected.

Among those testifying were Joel Clement, a whistleblower who said he was removed from his work on climate change and reassigned to an accounting role.

Also testifying was Maria Caffrey, who said she had to fight with the Interior Department to keep references to the human contributions to climate change in a report on how sea level rise would impact national parks.

Clement said under the Trump administration, the Interior Department “has sidelined scientists and experts, flattened the morale of the career staff, and by all accounts, is bent on hollowing out the Agency.”

Clement, now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said he was removed from his work with 30 Alaska Native communities that were “one big storm away from being wiped right off the map” and needed to be immediately relocated.

Caffrey, whose research was funded by the Interior Department, said she found herself repeatedly demoted at the agency after pushing to keep references to the human impacts of climate change in her report.

“It removes the meaning from my study. I prepared four different climate scenarios for those three different time periods, so those scenarios hang on how much greenhouse gases we produce in the future,” she said, including how much humans contribute to the atmosphere.

“I had become at outcast for standing up,” she added, noting the department told her they didn’t want her help even on a volunteer basis. She is now looking for work in the Denver area.

The hearing was to discuss the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Democrats seek help in appealing to conservatives on climate | Whistleblowers say Interior sidelined scientists | Automakers strike fuel efficiency deal with California in rebuff to Trump Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California MORE (D-N.Y.) that would add protections for government scientists, including allowing them to publish research outside of government channels and establish a Scientific Integrity Officer.

Several Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee complained the hearing was political theater centered around a bill that would have to pass out of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.

They said there were more complaints about misuse of science under the Obama administration.

“In listening to some of our panelists today you would think that the Trump administration was the only one where there have been issues regarding scientific integrity, and that certainly is not the case,” said Rep. Jody Hice Jody Brownlow HiceInterior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess The 27 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block Trump from taking military action against Iran MORE (R-Ga.).

Tonko said such instances should only strengthen their interest in joining their bill.

“If you believe in science and scientific integrity we should have learned from that past and not look for a reason not to do this,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that ""it’s no secret that the Trump administration is not a fan of science.”

“There are the stories that career scientists at Interior are too afraid to share. And with good reason. They have seen their colleagues, like our witnesses, get threatened, harassed, reassigned, and retaliated against,” he added.

Scientists have been vocal about what they view as mistreatment under the Trump administration.

They have cited examples, ranging from limiting government-funded scientists from sitting on an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) board to a proposal to limit what kind of studies can be considered by the EPA, to recent plans to relocate U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers and Bureau of Land Management policymakers.

“To purge the language of climate change from the agency entirely is a direct assault on the science we know is very prominent and very clear on the risk to the mission of the agency that we act now to protect real people in harm’s way,” Clement said.

Interior was invited to attend the hearing but did not send a representative.

""The Department of the Interior diligently works to accommodate Congressional invitations to testify,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill, saying it had participated in 59 of 62 Congressional legislative and oversight hearings that the Department has been invited to, or 95 percent, and provided over 65 witnesses for Committees."""
DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"

Right on the heels of what it says was another record Prime Day, the company reported its first profit miss in two years as it ramps up spending to improve and expand its delivery efforts. Earlier this year, Amazon invested $800 million to launch free one-day delivery for all Prime members.

Alphabet reported a beat on the top and bottom line. Revenue jumped 19% and profits came in at $9.2 billion as the tech giant continues to dominate internet search. Growth expected to persist as Google continues to stack ads into platforms including Maps and YouTube. This happened while Google and other tech giants are coming under scrutiny from foreign regulators and the U.S. Justice Department over antitrust concerns.

Facebook fell below the $200 mark to end the week despite posting strong revenue and earnings growth. The company reported $16.9 billion in revenue, beating estimates of $16.5 billion. Facebook also beat on earnings per share, announcing a profit of $1.99 per share versus estimates of $1.88 per share. This comes after Facebook reached a major settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and was hit with a $5 billion fine Wednesday.

Robert Mueller arrived on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning for the most highly anticipated hearings so far of this presidency, with the potential to reset the narrative about his two-year investigation into President Donald Trump.Follow below in real time to catch up on what was discussed during the nearly 8-hour hearings.8:05 a.m.Former special counsel Robert Mueller has arrived on Capitol Hill to testify before two House panels about his Russia investigation.Mueller was flanked by police officers in the Rayburn House Office Building as he headed toward a hearing room Wednesday morning. Senior Mueller aide Aaron Zebley also was in the hearing room.Mueller is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee and the House intelligence committee.Mueller's investigation shadowed Donald Trump's presidency for nearly two years and officially concluded in March, when he submitted his 448-page report.The nation has heard the former special counsel speak only once, for nine minutes in May, since his 2017 appointment.Mueller has expressed his reluctance to testify and said he won't go beyond what's in his report.Trump has called Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt.""___8:30 a.m.Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler opens the hearing with Mueller.___8:37 a.m. Nadler says his committee has ""a responsibility to address"" the evidence that former Mueller has uncovered in his Trump-Russia investigation.Opening a three-hour hearing, Nadler said there are themes to the hearing: ""Responsibility, integrity, and accountability.""Nadler laid out the examples from Mueller's report that committee members intend to focus on while questioning the reluctant former special counsel.Mueller wrote in the document that he could not exonerate President Donald Trump on obstruction of justice.He noted Trump's directions to then-White House counsel Donald McGahn to have Mueller removed and, once that was made public, orders from Trump to McGahn to deny it happened.Nadler said ""not even the president is above the law.""___8:40 a.m.Republican Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, defended Trump's attitude toward Robert Mueller's investigation, saying ""the president knew he was innocent."" Collins added: ""This hearing is long overdue. We’ve had the truth for months — no American conspired to throw our elections. What we need today is to let that truth bring us confidence and closure.""8:43 a.m. Mueller is sworn into the House Judiciary Committee hearing.___8:45 a.m.Mueller delivers his opening statement to the committee.___8:50 a.m. Mueller opened his testimony by going over his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.He said his investigation found that the ""Russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion.""Mueller said his testimony today will ""necessarily be limited."" In his opening statement, he outlined his reasons for that:""First, public testimony could affect several ongoing matters. In some of these matters, court rules or judicial orders limit the disclosure of information to protect the fairness of the proceedings. And consistent with longstanding Justice Department policy, it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way that could affect an ongoing matter.""""Second, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities. We did not address 'collusion,' which is not a legal term. Rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not.""Third, our investigation of efforts to obstruct the investigation and lie to investigators was of critical importance. Obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government’s effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable.""___8:52 a.m.Nadler begins his questioning of Mueller. Mueller dismisses President Trump's claim of ""total exoneration,"" saying it's not what his Russia report said.Mueller told lawmakers that investigators did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice. Mueller added it was ""true"" that Trump refused to sit for an interview, despite his team's multiple attempts to secure the interview.8:57 a.m.Collins asks Mueller whether ""collusion"" and ""conspiracy"" are the same thing. Mueller testified that they weren’t the same, but Collins cited a part of the report that he thought was contradictory.On page 180 of volume one, the Mueller report said: ""Collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. To the contrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute.""This part of the report was talking about collusion in the sense of corporate collusion, which is when companies conspire in an illegal fashion to help each other and hurt consumers.However, that is completely unrelated to “collusion with Russia,” which has been the colloquial term used over the past few years to discuss potential cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.___9:02 a.m.Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California asked Mueller if his investigation found that ""the Russian government perceived it would benefit from one of the candidates winning.""Mueller said they did.She continued: ""And which candidate would that be?""Mueller responded: ""Well, it would be Trump.""___ 9:07 a.m. Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas echoed an argument that former White House Special counsel Emmet Flood made to Attorney General William Barr after the release of the Mueller report.The criticism that the justice system’s standard of proof is not to prove innocence, but rather guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.___ 9:25 a.m. Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen asked former Special Counsel Robert Mueller about former Attorney General Jeff Session's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.Mueller said it is true that his investigation found that Trump asked Sessions to un-recuse himself at least twice.___9:40 a.m.Mueller downplayed his relationship with former FBI director James Comey, denying they were “good friends,” as Rep. Louie Gohmert questioned him.Mueller admitting only that they were “friends” and “business associates.”“We both started off at the Justice Department about the same time,” Mueller said.Mueller said he had not spoken with Comey in the six months before he was appointed special counsel in 2017.___9:55 a.m.Mueller is disputing President Trump's claim that Mueller was rebuffed in a bid to fill the post of FBI director.Facing questions from congressional lawmakers, Mueller said he spoke with Trump about the FBI job before he was named as special counsel, but ""not as a candidate.""Then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has said that while the White House invited Mueller to speak to the president about the FBI and thought about asking him to become director again, Mueller did not come in looking for a job.Trump tweeted Wednesday that there are ""numerous witnesses,"" including Vice President Mike Pence, who could say that Mueller applied and interviewed for the job and was ""turned down"" for it.Pence spokesperson Alyssa Farah told the Associated Press that the vice president ""was present in the Oval Office when Robert Mueller interviewed for the job of FBI Director in May of 2017.""___10:15 a.m.Before he began taking questions, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller said that his testimony would ""be limited"" and he promised to stick to the text of his report.He seems to be sticking to that promise.For the first hour and a half of his testimony, Mueller has told members of Congress to refer to the report in answering questions at least 28 times.He has also deflected or declined to answer at least three additional times, saying he would have to check on that or look more closely at the statute.___10:20 a.m.During his questioning of Mueller, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, outlined why he believed the president had committed obstruction of justice:""The investigation found substantial evidence that when the President ordered Don McGahn to fire the special counsel and then lie about it, Donald Trump, one, committed an obstructive act. Two, connected to the initial proceeding. Three, did so with corrupt intent. Those are the elements of obstruction of justice,"" he said. Jeffries added: ""This is the United States of America. No one is above the law. No one. The President must be held accountable one way or the other.""Mueller responded that he was ""not supportive"" of Jeffries' analysis, but said it's not ""out of the ballpark.""___10:30 a.m.There was tension in an exchange between Mueller and Rep. Matt Gaetz, who had ripped the former special counsel for not reviewing the motivations and sourcing behind the dossier built by Christopher Steele. “You weren’t interested in whether or not Russians were interfering through Christopher Steele, and if Steele was lying, then you should have charged him with lying, like you charged a variety of other people, but you say nothing about this in your report. Meanwhile, director, you’re quite loquacious on other topics,” said Gaetz, a Florida Republican.Mueller tried unsuccessfully to interject and later raised his voice slightly when responding to prevent another interruption from the congressman. “What I take is missing here is the fact that this is under investigation elsewhere in the Justice Department and if I can finish sir — and if I can finish sir — and consequently it’s not within my purview. The Department of Justice and FBI should be responsive to questions on this particular issue,” Mueller said.___10:40 a.m. Robert Mueller confirmed that President Trump asked staff to falsify records relevant to the ongoing investigation.The issue came up during a line of questioning by Democratic Republican Rep. Cedric Richmond.Here is that exchange:Richmond: So it's fair to say the president tried to protect himself by asking staff to falsify records relevant to an ongoing investigation?Mueller: I would say that's generally a summary.Richmond: Would you say that that action the president tried to hamper the investigation by asking staff to falsify records relevant to your investigation? Mueller: I am just going to have to refer you to the report if I could for the review of that episode.Richmond: Thank you. Also the president's attempt to get McGahn to create a false written record were related to Mr. Trump's concerns were related to President Trump's concerns about your obstruction of justice inquiry, correct?Mueller: I believe that to be true.___10:45 a.m. President Trump's sons and advisers are weighing in on former special counsel Robert Mueller's congressional testimony with quips on Twitter targeting Democrats.Donald Trump Jr. is calling the hearing a ""disaster"" for Democrats. He says Mueller claims he can't understand the Republicans' questions, but totally gets the ones from Democrats.Eric Trump says GOP Rep. Jim Jordan's comments at the hearing were ""spot on."" Jordan says Democrats should be investigating what he says are ""false accusations"" that started the Russia probe.Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says the hearing shows the Russia probe was run by Democrats wanting to destroy Trump.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted three words: ""drop the mic.""___11 a.m.Mueller affirms that a president can be charged with crimes after leaving office.He says Justice Department guidelines prevented him from considering charges against President Donald Trump while he is in office.Because of the longtime Justice Department guidance that a sitting president cannot be indicted, Mueller says ""one of the tools a prosecutor would use is not there.""Mueller has said his investigators could not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. His report said they did not find sufficient evidence to establish charges of criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.___11:15 a.m.Mueller pushed back against California Republican Tom McClintock, who said his team may not have “faithfully, accurately, impartially, and completely described all of the underlying evidence in the Mueller report.”""The fundamental problem is, as I said, we've got to take your word, your team, faithfully, accurately, impartially, and completely described all of the underlying evidence in the Mueller report, and we're finding more and more instances where this just isn't the case. And it's starting to look like, you know, having desperately tried and failed to make a legal case against the president, you made a political case instead. You put it in a paper sack, lit it on fire, dropped it on our porch, rang the doorbell, and ran,"" McClintock said.“I don't think you reviewed a report that is as thorough, as fair, as consistent as the report that we have in front of us,” Mueller said.___11:30 a.m.Multiple members were seen listening to today's hearing on speakerphone as they walked into a caucus meeting this morning.CNN caught up with some of them and to get their thoughts about the hearing.Here's what they said:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: She said she feels optimistic about today's hearing after watching some of it this morning. “I did see the beginning,” she told CNN, adding, “I’m very optimistic that the public will be aware of the facts and the truth as a result of the (voice trails off).”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer: He briefly outlined what he needs to hear from Mueller: “I hope he tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”Rep. Jan Schakowsky: She attended the caucus meeting and told reporters that Democrats didn’t talk about Mueller at all in their meeting. She said they talked about infrastructure and how great of a negotiator Speaker Pelosi was on the budget deal.Rep. Al Green: He brought a printed and highlighted version of the Mueller report — and read portions of it to the cameras.Rep. Maxine Waters: She said she is “certainly hopeful that the judiciary committee will be able to unveil some of the information that went into the report, that is not absolutely known or understood so that the American public can really get a better understanding of how serious this is.”Rep. Lauren Underwood: She told a reporter, “Do I want to be sitting in the room and watching it? Yes.” Underwood said she thought it was “so important that this information comes to light.” ___11:35 a.m.President Trump has said repeatedly that Mueller interviewed for the FBI director job just before he was appointed as special counsel in May 2017.Mueller provided more context about that conversation, from his point of view, under tough questioning from GOP Rep. Greg Steube.Mueller said he was asked by the president for input about on the post, but said he was not interviewing for the job itself.___11:50 a.m.Mueller has deferred or declined to answer questions from members of Congress at least 111 times, including during an exchange with Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana over whether his report recommended the impeachment of the president. Johnson: It does not conclude that impeachment would be appropriate here, right?Mueller: I'm not going to talk about that issue.___ 1 p.m. As the second hearing started around 1 p.m. EST, Mueller sat before the House Intelligence Committee, which has 22 members. The Democratic chair Adam Schiff opened the hearing with a statement regarding the investigation and the Russian interference in the 2016 election. He said Mueller’s report details “Lies about a gleaming tower in Moscow and lies about talks with the Kremlin. Lies about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, and lies about efforts to fire you, Mr. Mueller, and lies to cover it up. Lies about secret negotiations with the Russians over sanctions and lies about Wikileaks. Lies about polling data and lies about hush money payments. Lies about meetings in the Seychelles to set up secret back channels and lies about a secret meeting in New York Trump Tower. Lies to the FBI, lies to your staff, and lies to our Committee. And lies to obstruct an investigation into the most serious attack on our democracy by a foreign power in our history.”He continued, “The president and his acolytes say your report found no collusion, though your report explicitly declined to address that question, since collusion can involve both criminal and non-criminal conduct,"" he said. ""They say the president has been fully exonerated, though you specifically declare you could not exonerate him."" ___ 1:05 p.m. Ranking Republican member Devin Nunes took over saying there is collusion but between Russia and the Democratic party and revolving around the creation and release of the Steele Dossier. ""They said they want to, quote, bring the Mueller report to life and create a television moment through ploys, like having Mr. Mueller recite passages from his own report,"" Nunes said. ""In other words, this is political theater, it’s a Hail Mary attempt to convince the American people that collusion is real and that it's concealed in the report,"" he said.As the second hearing started, the White House issued a statement, calling former special counsel Robert Mueller's congressional testimony ""an epic embarrassment for the Democrats.""Press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement as Mueller prepared for a second round of testimony on Capitol Hill about his investigation into Russian election interference and obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.Grisham's statement says: ""The last three hours have been an epic embarrassment for the Democrats. Expect more of the same in the second half.""__1:30 p.m. Mueller started his second opening statement by asking that his first statement be considered in conjunction with this statement. While he discussed the investigation, Mueller was joined by his longtime aide, Aaron Zebley, who was a deputy special counsel. Zebley has been part of Mueller’s team for years, including serving as chief of staff for the FBI in 2011 when Mueller appointed him during his time as the FBI director. During his opening statement, Mueller took time during his to correct certain aspects of an exchange with Rep. Ted Lieu. In the exchange, listed below, Mueller did not expressly state that his team found that the president was not indicted solely based on the Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Lieu: So, to recap what we've heard, we have heard today that the president ordered former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire you. The president ordered Don McGahn to then cover that up and create a false paper trail. And now we've heard the president ordered Cory Lewandowski to tell Jeff Sessions to limit your investigation so that he — you stop investigating the president. I believe a reasonable person looking at these facts could conclude that all three elements of the crime of obstruction of justice have been met, and I'd like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct? Mueller: That is correct.However, during his opening statement, Mueller clarified his answer. ""Now before we go to questions, I want to add on correction to my testimony this morning. I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu who said, and I quote, you didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion. That is not the correct way to say it,"" Mueller said.He went on, correcting his statement, ""As we say in the report, and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'm ready to answer questions.""__ 1:35 p.m. Former special counsel Robert Mueller says his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was ""not a witch hunt.""Mueller is testifying Wednesday afternoon before the House intelligence committee on his 448-page report. He spent hours testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.President Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to the Russia investigation as a witch hunt, including Wednesday morning when he tweeted the hearings were part of the ""Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history.""Mueller was responding to a question from intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat.___1:45 p.m.Several times during the start of the second hearing, the name Joseph Mifsud was brought to the discussion. Mifsud is a Malta-born professor accused of having ties to the Russian government and attempted to bring Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos closer to the Russians. In relation to the Mueller probe, Mifsud was determined to have told Papadopoulos that Russia “could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton.”Since having his name brought up in the probe, Mifsud has reportedly vanished. When asked what candidates in the 2020 election should do if presented with “dirt” from a foreign individual or government on an opponent, Mueller said those contacts should be reported. ""Should be. Can be, depending on the circumstances, a crime,"" Mueller said.___2: 10 p.m. Robert Mueller asserted that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was “not a hoax” during his second testimony. ""The indictments we returned against the Russians — two different ones — were substantial in their scope, using the scope word again. And I think we have underplayed to a certain extent that aspect of our investigation that has and would have long term damage to the United States that we need to move quickly to address.”When asked specifically about Wikileaks and its presence in the 2016 election, Mueller said, “Problematic is an understatement in terms of what it displays in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity.” ___2:45 p.m. Mueller repeatedly dodged questions surrounding several aspects of the investigation and reports published by media sources, saying either he simply could not comment or would not at least 60 times. In particular, one representative asked Mueller about his investigation and whether or not a member of his team traveled overseas as part of the probe. He confirmed that someone did but declined to go into further detail. Robert Mueller also refused to say whether his team subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr.Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, asked Mueller if he subpoenaed the president's eldest son or if he wanted to interview him. Mueller responded: ""I'm not going to discuss that.""Mueller's report on the Russia investigation, which was released in April, said Trump Jr. had ""declined to be voluntarily interviewed"" by the special counsel's office.There are two lines in the report, following that statement, that are redacted because they contain grand jury information.However, when asked if Mueller believed the Russian’s attempt to interfere in our election was a “single attempt,” he quickly spoke up. Mueller said he believed it was not a “single attempt” and that he believed they were attempting to interfere again “as we sit here.” Here's the exchange:Hurd: Is this –– in your investigation, did you think that this was a single attempt by the Russians to get involved in our election? Or did you find evidence to suggest they'll try to do this again.Mueller: It wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here. And they expect to do it during the next campaign.___3:15 p.m. When asked about interferences in future elections by foreign entities and whether he believed that campaigns would take the information or decline to report the offer altogether, Mueller said he feared it would be the new norm. Rep. Peter Welch, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the issue and the following exchange occurred. ""My concern is, have we established a new normal from this past campaign that is going to apply to future campaigns so that any one of us from the U.S. House, any candidate for the Senate, any candidate for the presidency of the United States, aware that if a hostile foreign powers is trying to influence an election has no duty to report that to the FBI or other authorities?"" Welch asked.Mueller responded: ""I hope this is not the new normal. But I fear it is.""Welch went on to ask Mueller if he had any advice for Congress on protecting the electoral system.""I would say the basis — the first line of defense really is the ability of the various agencies who have some piece of this to not only share explanation, but shared expertise, to share targets, to use the full resources that we have, to address this problem,"" Mueller said.___3:20 p.mMueller also shed light on why his team did issue a subpoena to Trump to appear in person before the special counsel. For “a little over a year” they attempted to negotiate with the president to come in person and answer questions. They eventually decided that it would hold up the investigation further and that they should carry on with only the written answers. ""But finally, when we were almost towards the end of our investigation, and we had little success in pushing to get the interview of the president, we decided that we did not want to exercise the subpoena powers because of the necessity of expediting the end the investigation,"" Mueller said.He said, ""The expectation was if we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena, and we would be in the midst of the investigation for a substantial period of time.""When asked about whether or not the president’s answers were adequate enough, the following exchange occurred. Rep. Val Demings asked Mueller: ""Director Mueller, isn't it fair to say the president's written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete, because he didn't answer many of your questions, but where he did, his answers showed he wasn't always being truthful?""Mueller responded in four simple words: ""I would say generally.""Michael Cohen, the president's former personal attorney, issued a statement regarding the Mueller testimony. Here's the statement that was provided to CNN: “Mr. Mueller today had the world stage to answer questions regarding obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Sadly, his reluctance just continues to leave the debate open and those responsible free from prosecution ... for the moment. The American people deserve more! The allegations raised against me in the Steele dossier were blatant lies. At least today’s hearings confirmed this. If our elected officials want more information or clarification they know where to find me...”"
A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia faces conflict of interest problem in labor lawyer brother,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/labor-secretary-nominee-eugene-scalia-faces-conflict-of-interest-problem-in-labor-lawyer-brother,"Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia may be obligated to recuse himself from some agency litigation, ethics experts say, because his younger brother John is a high-profile management-side lawyer involved in cases before the agency.

The situation would be an unusual one, because it doesn't involve a financial conflict of interest, just a familial one, and it is not clear how it will be addressed by the administration.

Family ties can create tricky situations for officials regardless of how they handle them. For example, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts slammed then-Securities and Exchange Committee Chairwoman Mary Jo White in 2015 for recusing herself from SEC cases in which her husband was a litigator, arguing her recusals disrupted the SEC by stalling prosecutions.

President Trump last week tapped the elder brother, Eugene, 55, to replace the departing labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, who stepped down following criticism of his 2008 prosecution as a U.S. attorney of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Scalia has worked with the private sector management-side firm Gibson Dunn, where he has led its Labor and Employment Practice Group for the past 12 years.

John, the second-oldest son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is a shareholder at the firm GreenbergTraurig, where he also practices labor law. According to John's bio on the firm's website, ""He practices regularly in federal and state courts, in private mediation and arbitration proceedings, and before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and equivalent state administrative agencies.""

In a 2008 case, for example, John Scalia defended a company, L-3 Services, when the Department of Labor, then headed by now-Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, alleged it violated overtime rules. It eventually agreed to pay $700,000 in backpay to victims. In a 2015 case, he defended the chief operating officer of a company, Chimes DC, alleged to have violated fiduciary duties. A district court threw out the charges against his client late last year.

The Scalia brothers' overlapping business is a potential problem, said Wilma Liebman, former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board, a separate federal agency that enforces labor laws.

""Surely Eugene’s involvement as secretary in any matter in which his brother John is involved would scream conflict of interest, or at least appearance of conflict — equally critical. I would think that he would have to recuse himself from any involvement in such a case,"" said Liebman, now a senior research associate at Harvard Law School's labor and worklife program.

It doesn't matter if the elder brother isn't directly involved in any litigation, she said. ""I don’t think the department head is sufficiently removed from litigation that it does not matter. For one, litigation brought by or against the department is in the name of the secretary,"" she said.

The proper course of action, said Scott Amey, chief counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, would be for Scalia ""to be recused from handling or participating in any cases that would involve his brother or possibly even his brother's firm, just make sure there isn't even an appearance of a conflict of interest."" All matters regarding the litigation would have to be handled the next in line at the department, the deputy secretary. That would likely be Patrick Pizzella, who is the department's acting secretary until the Senate confirms a new head of the cabinet agency.

Amey said that, in the Scalias' case, Eugene would also need to ensure that there is no ""trickle down effect"" where cases brought by his brother's firm receive preferential treatment by people in the department who think it might win favor with the department head. What complicates the situation, Amey noted, is that most ethics rules are written to prevent financial conflicts of interest. Family connections don't necessarily involve such financial ties, but can still represent a potential conflict. There is little precedent for addressing the possible conflicts, according to Amey and others contacted by the Washington Examiner.

The elder Scalia will likely address the matter in an agreement made with the Office of Government Ethics, said an individual with knowledge of the process. All nominees for a cabinet-level position must make such an agreement, which is then reviewed and agreed upon by the cabinet agency’s chief ethics official and OGE. The agreement outlines any conflicts and how they will be addressed. It is posted publicly.

""We are mindful of ethical obligations and it is our duty to comply with them. In the event where an attorney would need to appear before a family member we would adhere to all applicable ethical guidelines,"" a spokesman for Greenberg Taurig told the Washington Examiner.

The White House has not said whether Scalia has submitted anything to OGE, though Amey noted it is still early in the nomination process. The White House and Labor Department declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said it was greenlighting T-Mobile US Inc's request to acquire rival Sprint Corp after the companies agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses including Boost Mobile to Dish Network Corp in an effort to create a new wireless competitor.

The Justice Department and five state attorneys general said they were filing suit to enforce the settlement conditions that also include the companies providing DISH with access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. The deal, which would merge the nation's third and fourth largest wireless carriers, has been challenged in court by some other state attorneys general led by New York.

Justice Department officials have communicated to Robert Mueller that the department expects him to limit his congressional testimony this week to the public findings of his 448-page report, according to one current and one former U.S. official familiar with the preparations.

In extensive discussions since the former special counsel was subpoenaed on June 25 to testify, department officials have emphasized that they consider any evidence he gathered throughout the course of his investigation to be “presumptively privileged” and shielded from public disclosure.

The Justice Department is “taking the position that anything outside the written pages of the report are things about which presidential privilege hasn’t been waived,” the former U.S. official said.

The White House and the Justice Department, however, have signaled they don’t intend to place lawyers in the room during Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees on Wednesday.

Without a presence at the hearing, administration officials would have little recourse to prevent Mueller from going off-script and revealing details of his investigation that the White House considers off-limits. They are poised instead to rely on Mueller to self-police his remarks, indicating that they are confident the former special counsel will stick to carefully planned comments that mirror the already disclosed findings of his investigation.

Their stance cuts against President Donald Trump’s own protestation that Mueller shouldn’t be allowed to testify, which he reiterated on Monday. “Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

The president has accused Democrats of trying to conduct a “do-over” of Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe that he has falsely claimed “exonerates” him.

Mueller’s posture will likely deprive Democrats of an opportunity to get a clear answer from Mueller about whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president, among other burning questions. Mueller said publicly after the report’s release that he adhered to a Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.

But some Democrats have said that even if Mueller simply reads from his report word for word, it would educate the American public about Trump’s attempts to thwart the Russia probe.

Jim Popkin, a spokesman for Mueller, said he was unsure whether Mueller was in contact with the Justice Department about aspects of his investigation that the administration believes would be off-limits during his testimony.

“In terms of DOJ and the Hill, there have been discussions for purposes of scheduling and clearly … to understand what the expectations are,” Popkin told POLITICO. “But they have not seen the [opening] statement. They’ve not provided the statement to either DOJ or anyone in the House.”

Popkin emphasized that Mueller’s opening statement would stay within “the four walls of the report as much as that is possible.”

Mueller has stated that his congressional testimony would not go beyond what is contained within his report.

The report “contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mueller said on May 29. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. The report is my testimony.”

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, said on his radio show Monday that he, too, believes Mueller will not speak publicly about matters outside of his report.

“I think that would be completely unethical to go beyond the report,” Sekulow said, adding that he expects Republicans — who say they are essentially seeking to cross-examine Mueller and press him on the origins of the probe — to also face roadblocks.

The Justice Department’s deference to Mueller cuts against the administration’s handling of efforts by Congress to interview former officials who were crucial witnesses in the special counsel investigation.

White House lawyers have accompanied those high-level witnesses subpoenaed by Congress, including Trump’s former communications director Hope Hicks, to their hearings, objecting to hundreds of questions lobbed at them by Democratic lawmakers on the grounds that any conversations that took place during their time in the White House are subject to presidential privilege claims. The White House has consistently pushed the idea that some current and former advisers are “absolutely immune” from answering questions about their White House tenures.

Negotiations over the scope of Mueller’s testimony have taken place under a veil of secrecy. Justice Department officials have been discussing the parameters of Mueller’s testimony with him and his team ever since the former special counsel was subpoenaed last month.

Attorney General William Barr has said publicly that Mueller is free to testify on Capitol Hill, but he has also said that he would support Mueller if he decides to skip the hearing. The Justice Department has not indicated publicly whether it will direct Mueller to limit his remarks in any way, but a spokesperson said in a cryptic statement that the department expects Mueller to keep his testimony within the bounds of the report.

“As the attorney general has said, we support special counsel Mueller if he wants to testify or if he doesn’t want to testify,” a Justice Department official said. “He has said publicly that his report is his testimony and that is our expectation. We support that approach.”

As a private citizen, Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule-follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s direction.

A Judiciary Committee official said the panel does not anticipate that lawmakers will spar with Mueller over matters of presidential privilege.

“[T]hese are private individuals who no longer work at the Department of Justice. And although we acknowledge that these are career department officials who give quite a bit of deference to what the department says, the department cannot order them to do anything,” the Judiciary Committee official said.

Even though Trump and his aides are projecting a hands-off approach, they’ve signaled that they expect Mueller to closely guard the voluminous evidence he gathered about the inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump’s former counsel Emmet Flood warned the Justice Department in April that it considers any of Mueller’s evidence, other than what’s contained in the public version of his report, “presumptively privileged” and forbidden from public disclosure.

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over the entirety of Mueller’s report and the underlying evidence as part of a bid to block the House Judiciary Committee’s access to the complete, unredacted report.

Trump invoked the broad privilege claim just minutes before the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress — a move that came after hours of exhaustive negotiations between the committee and the Justice Department over how to delay the contempt proceedings. The White House later called the committee’s demands “unlawful and reckless.”
