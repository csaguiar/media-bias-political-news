Trump taps Melania Trump's spokeswoman as next White House press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Kate Bennett'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/politics/stephanie-grisham-press-secretary/index.html,"(CNN) Melania Trump's spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham will get a major new role as both White House press secretary and communications director, the first lady tweeted Tuesday.

""I am pleased to announce @StephGrisham45 will be the next @PressSec & Comms Director! She has been with us since 2015 - @POTUS & I can think of no better person to serve the Administration & our country. Excited to have Stephanie working for both sides of the @WhiteHouse. #BeBest"" Melania Trump tweeted.

President Donald Trump didn't look far for his next press secretary in Grisham, who for the past two years has been the communications director for the first lady. Grisham will keep her current job too.

However, Trump has tweaked the job duties before handing the reins to Grisham, whose purview will include a larger scope of responsibility than that of her predecessor Sarah Sanders , and one as yet unprecedented in this administration. Trump has appointed Grisham both White House director of communications as well as press secretary, a senior White House official tells CNN. Grisham will be assuming the roles formerly held by Bill Shine, who departed as White House communications director in March, and Sanders, who has said her last day will be this Friday.

Additionally, Grisham will remain in charge of communications for the East Wing in addition to her new West Wing responsibilities, staying on as the spokeswoman for the first lady, says the official.

Grisham will be accompanying the President in her new capacity on his trip to Japan and Korea this week

Sanders' pick

A source close to the White House who is familiar with discussions regarding Trump's selection of Grisham as press secretary says Sanders was talking up deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley as her replacement and talking down the idea of Grisham as late as her going away party Monday night with White House reporters. Another White House official also confirmed Grisham was pushing Gidley.

But this source said Grisham was Trump's clear choice from the beginning. Trump wanted somebody from his inner circle, according to the source. Gidley was never seriously considered by Trump, the source said despite Sanders' attempts to pick her own successor.

Trump ""is going with the team he trusts,"" the source said.

Grisham was at Camp David this weekend with Trump, two people familiar with the matter said.

She didn't depart with the President on Saturday morning but joined the small group of aides — which included Dan Scavino and later acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney — later in the day at the mountainside retreat.

Grisham met with Sanders at the White House on Tuesday afternoon following the announcement of her promotion. Several reporters were gathered outside Sanders' office door, to which Sanders told Grisham to ""get used to it.""

One of the earliest members of Trump's team

Grisham has been with team Trump longer than anyone currently in the White House, with the exception of Scavino, both of whom started on the Trump campaign in 2015. Prior to that, Grisham worked as a spokeswoman and communications operative, mostly in Republican politics, in her home state of Arizona; in 2012, she briefly worked on Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Before joining Trump's campaign, she was operating her own public relations and communications company in Arizona, but decided to commit to the role of traveling press director after assisting with a July 2015 rally in Phoenix by then-candidate Trump.

Once part of the campaign, Grisham wrangled media as Trump canvassed the country. After Trump took office, Grisham served as deputy press secretary in the West Wing during Sean Spicer's tenure.

However, Grisham soon caught the eye of first lady Melania Trump, who was impressed by Grisham's assistance during the first visit of Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie Abe to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, in February 2017. By the end of March, Grisham had made the move to the East Wing.

During her time with the first lady, Grisham has handled much of the responsibility of the first lady's forward-facing presence where she's made a name for herself as a dogged, if caustic, defender.

Dubbed ""the enforcer"" in a 2018 Washington Post profile, Grisham's job is to thwart as much as possible the criticism levied at the first lady on topics that have ranged from picking cyberbullying as part of her platform to Trump's need for privacy during a secretive kidney operation last April. Grisham has also helmed PR on the seemingly opposing views of the first lady to those of the President and navigated Melania Trump's silence in the face of headlines about Trump's alleged infidelities, which he denies.

During the Stormy Daniels scandal, as a silent first lady made few public appearances, Grisham fired off a tweet scolding rampant stories about the first couple's marriage.

""While I know the media is enjoying speculation & salacious gossip, I'd like to remind people there's a minor child who's name should be kept out of news stories when at all possible,"" tweeted Grisham.

But it was Grisham's participation in one of Melania Trump's biggest power plays that got the most attention. As sparring with East Wing staff escalated after fallout from a tiff during the first lady's first solo trip to Africa, Grisham released a statement calling for the firing of Mira Ricardel, a longtime government official and Trump's deputy national security adviser.

Ricardel, who was not particularly well-liked according to those who worked with her, and Grisham, had butted heads during the Africa trip, and Ricardel had not forgotten it, making it a mission to continue the feud back home in the weeks that followed. After flagging Ricardel's behavior to the West Wing, to no avail, the first lady consented to Grisham releasing a statement that read: ""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.""

Within two days, Ricardel had been dismissed from the White House by the President and Melania Trump had staked claim that she and her staff are not to be tangled with.

"Trump vows Iran cannot have path to nukes, says he hopes sanctions sent ‘message’",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-fires-back-at-irans-insulting-statement-warns-any-attack-to-be-met-with-overwhelming-force,"President Trump said Tuesday that he hopes Iran got the “message” after his administration escalated sanctions against the regime following the downing of a U.S. drone, while firing back at the country’s leaders for declaring diplomacy between the two nations dead.

Speaking at the White House, the president reiterated his vow that Iran cannot be allowed to have a path to develop nuclear weapons.

""We're not gonna allow that to happen, can't do it,"" Trump said, calling on the regime to end the ""hostility.""

He said he hopes Iran gets the “message” from sanctions. Asked if there’s an exit strategy for Iran, Trump said: “You’re not going to need an exit strategy.”

The president also warned Iran earlier in the day that any attack on the U.S. would be met with “overwhelming force” following a fiery response from Iran to the latest U.S. sanctions.

Abbas Mousavi, a spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, had said that newly announced U.S. sanctions against Iranian leadership meant permanently closing the “channel of diplomacy” between the two countries. President Hassan Rouhani said the White House is “afflicted by mental retardation.”

COTTON MOCKS IRAN OFFICIAL'S SANCTIONS COMPLAINT: WON'T BE ABLE TO SPEND IRANIANS' MONEY IN '5-STAR RESTAURANTS'

“Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality,” Trump said in a late morning tweet. “Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No More John Kerry & Obama!”

Trump lamented that the people of Iran “are suffering and for no reason at all,” stating that the government “spends all of its money on Terror, and little on anything else.” Trump said that while “Iran’s leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’” they do understand the words “Strength and Power.”

The statements come amid mounting tensions with Iran. The administration imposed new sanctions Monday against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his associates, after Iran shot down an unmanned American drone last week. That incident led to intense deliberations over a possible U.S. military strike, but Trump revealed last week that he called off such a strike due to the high number of expected casualties.

Officials, however, confirmed to Fox News that the U.S. military did carry out a cyberattack against Iranian intelligence in response.

US MILITARY LAUNCHED CYBERATTACKS AGAINST IRAN AFTER DRONE SHOT DOWN: OFFICIALS

Before the drone shoot-down, six oil tankers also had been attacked in the Gulf of Oman, which the U.S. and its Gulf allies blame on Iran.

The Trump administration's sanctions were just the latest installation in part of its “maximum pressure campaign” aimed at pushing them to the negotiating table to work out terms for a deal that would be better for the U.S. than the Iran nuclear agreement. Trump pulled out of that deal, hoping to reach a new agreement that would prevent Iran from having ballistic missiles, which were not covered by the old deal entered into by then-President Barack Obama.

Pelosi whips border package: Don't vote with Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Sarah Ferris', 'Heather Caygle', 'Jennifer Scholtes']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/nancy-pelosi-border-spending-package-1382038,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats stressed the importance of passing their emergency funding package before lawmakers leave town for the weeklong recess. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress Pelosi whips border package: Don't vote with Trump Progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had expressed unease with the emergency spending bill.

House Democratic leaders emerged from a closed-door caucus meeting Tuesday confident that they had secured the votes for a contentious border funding bill even as they continued to privately discuss tweaks to appease progressives.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a final sales pitch to the caucus ahead of a Tuesday afternoon floor vote, arguing that Democrats need to stand behind their plan to tackle the humanitarian crisis, rather than squabble over President Donald Trump and his immigration policies. A vote against the bill, she said, would be a vote for Trump.

Story Continued Below

""The president would love for this bill to go down today,"" Pelosi told the caucus as she urged support, according to a senior Democratic aide. At one point, Pelosi asked the caucus, “Does anyone have a problem with the bill?"" the aide said. No one responded aloud.

As Pelosi worked the room, she walked around with a whip list in her hand as she approached individual members to see how they were going to vote. She encouraged lawmakers to chat with her outside if they had concerns, according to sources in the room.

“One of the things I don’t like is surprises,” Pelosi told members in the closed-door meeting.

And in remarks to reporters after the meeting, the California Democrat predicted a successful vote: ""It will pass when we bring it to the floor.""

The $4.5 billion emergency measure would avert a funding lapse at the federal refugee office that has overseen thousands of unaccompanied children migrating from Central America, though it would still need to be reconciled with the Senate's own version before becoming law.

Hours before the bill was slated to reach the floor, top Democrats were still in talks with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to try to address lingering unease about giving Trump any money for his immigration agenda. The caucus plans to meet later Tuesday before the vote to discuss the changes.

Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), the co-chair of that caucus, said Tuesday morning that they are pushing for stricter compliance rules — what he called a ""hammer"" — in case the agencies ignored their bill's oversight provisions.

""If there’s not a hammer, then it’s not really enforceable. So we just want to make sure there’s a little stronger language on that,"" Pocan said. ""We're so close.""

Several progressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have already secured last-minute tweaks to the bill after a late-night meeting in Pelosi's office on Monday. It’s not clear, however, whether they will be enough to win the support of the New York Democrat and her allies.

Those changes, which require certain standards of health, hygiene and nutrition for unaccompanied children, will be formally added to the bill ahead of the afternoon vote, House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern confirmed Tuesday.

Democrats also agreed to changes that tighten restrictions for short-term detention facilities, known as influx shelters, stating that no child could be kept in a shelter for more than 90 days. The new language would also ensure that all migrants in U.S. custody have access to translation services.

McGovern said that the ""hammer"" provision that progressives are seeking would likely be worked out in the final version.

What remains unclear is how both chambers of Congress and the White House can unite behind a final product this week, before lawmakers depart for a week-long Fourth of July recess.

Democratic and Republican leaders will have only three days to work out the key differences between the two versions of the bill. Some Democratic leaders have already discussed staying in town for an extra day on Friday.

Pelosi's all-out whip operation on Tuesday morning followed a lengthy — and tense — meeting in her office Monday night. Members of both the Hispanic and Progressive caucuses had been threatening to vote against the bill, putting its passage in jeopardy.

High-profile progressives, including Ocasio-Cortez, gave “impassioned” speeches Monday night about how the bill didn’t go far enough to ensure the administration was addressing basic humanitarian needs for migrant children who are being held at the border.

Pelosi and other top Democrats stressed the importance of passing their emergency funding package before lawmakers leave town for the recess — or risk getting stuck with the Senate’s version, which has fewer safeguards.

“It’s like every bill we pass — it’s not perfect, but it’s a good bill,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). “I think [that] most think it’s preferable to the Senate bill although the Senate bill is not a bad bill either.”

In addition to Pelosi, freshman Rep. Donna Shalala, a former Health and Human Services secretary, tried to rally her colleagues in support of the legislation during Tuesday’s private meeting.

“I ran HHS...there’s nothing more central to why I came here than protecting children,” she said. “And that’s what that bill’s about, it’s about kids.”

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the caucus chairman, acknowledged the unsettled mood of the caucus.

""What is clear is that there is understandable anxiety amongst members of the Democratic caucus because there's understandable anxiety among the Americans people,"" Jeffries told reporters."
Trump says US soccer star Megan Rapinoe's protest during national anthem is wrong,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-megan-rapinoe-national-anthem-protest,"President Trump on Monday said he does not think it is appropriate for U.S. women’s soccer star Megan Rapinoe to protest during the national anthem.

Rapinoe, who had initially knelt during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” while she played in the National Women’s Soccer League, had vowed not to put her hand over her heart or sing the lyrics while the national anthem played. She has so far held true through the Women’s World Cup.

MEGAN RAPINOE'S GOALS FROM THE SPOT GIVE US WOMEN 2-1 WIN OVER SPAIN, SETUP FRANCE MEETING

Trump made his comments on Rapinoe during an interview with The Hill. When he was asked about whether the co-captain’s decision to kneel is appropriate, Trump responded: “No. I don’t think so.”

The president, however, did offer praise for the soccer team after their win over Spain Monday in the first round of the knockout stage of the Women’s World Cup.

“I love watching women's soccer,” he told The Hill. “They’re really talented.”

Rapinoe told Yahoo Sports in May that her decision to kneel received a ton of backlash, expressing displeasure with U.S. Soccer’s lack of support and the federation’s decision to adopt a rule requiring players to “stand and honor the flag.”

US SOCCER STAR MEGAN RAPINOE STAYS TRUE TO HER WORD: DOESN'T SING NATIONAL ANTHEM BEFORE THAILAND MATCH

“Using this blanketed patriotism as a defense against what the protest actually is was pretty cowardly. I think the NFL does it,” she told Yahoo Sports. “I felt like the statement from U.S. Soccer, and then the rule they made without ever talking to me, that was the same as what the NFL was doing – just to not have the conversation, to try to just stop me from doing what I'm doing instead of at least having a conversation, and trying to figure out a [solution] that makes sense for everyone.”

Rapinoe called herself a “walking protest” and she believes the Trump administration doesn’t “value all Americans equally.”

“I feel like it's kind of defiance in and of itself to just be who I am and wear the jersey, and represent it,” Rapinoe told the website. “Because I'm as talented as I am, I get to be here, you don't get to tell me if I can be here or not. So it's kind of a good ‘F you' to any sort of inequality or bad sentiments that the administration might have towards people who don't look exactly like him. Which, God help us if we all looked like him. Scary. Really scary. Ahh, disturbing.”

USA-FRANCE WOMEN’S WORLD CUP QUARTERFINAL MATCH TICKET PRICES SKYROCKET

Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem before her match against the Chicago Red Stars in 2016. She called her actions a “little nod” to Kaepernick and “everything that he’s standing for right now.”

It was yet another personnel change at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security, where leadership instability has accompanied a crisis at the border amid the biggest migration surge in more than a decade.

The shake-up Tuesday continued a purge of DHS leadership that Trump began in April that has left every single border- or immigration-related agency at DHS with an acting leader who has not been confirmed by the Senate.

Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE who led the agency before Morgan’s arrival, will resume once more as ICE acting director, said the DHS officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the personnel moves have not been announced publicly.

The move to install Morgan at CBP appeared to be a victory for senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller, whose attempt to make the same move last month was blocked by Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who picked Sanders for the CBP job.

Sanders has served in his job as acting CBP commissioner for barely two months. He was named to the role after President Trump removed then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen from the department and replaced her with McAleenan, then commissioner of CBP.

Sanders had been pushing in recent weeks for an expansion of temporary holding facilities that could accommodate the growing number of underage mothers with infants who are being held in U.S. Border Patrol facilities because there is no room for them in shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services.

“As some of you are aware, yesterday I offered my resignation to Secretary McAleenan, effective Friday, July 5,” Sanders wrote in a message to staff. “Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”

A former technology executive, Sanders had a reputation as a low-key and nonpartisan figure at CBP. He served under McAleenan as CBP chief operating officer and before that worked at the Transportation Security Administration.

Another DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said personnel changes were also underway at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose acting director Mark Morgan was meeting Tuesday with senior CBP leaders.

The meetings fueled speculation that Sanders was removed to clear a path for Morgan to take over at CBP.

Morgan worked at the FBI under former director James B. Comey, and was brought in to CBP in 2014 to lead an overhaul of Border Patrol use-of-force policies. The effort was successful, but it chafed at senior CBP officials, who viewed him as an outsider who had not paid his dues by working as a rank-and-file border agent.

Morgan ascended to be head of the U.S. Border Patrol at the end of President Barack Obama’s second term, but he was removed from his job when Trump took office.

He worked his way back into Trump’s good graces through a series of appearances praising the president on Fox News. Trump named Morgan to the top job at ICE last month, saying he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.”

Morgan had never worked at ICE, though, and made his preference for the top CBP job clear to colleagues.

A CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the agency’s rank-and-file are divided over Morgan. But the official said Morgan’s FBI background allowed him to bring a different point of view to the sprawling agency.

“I liked his ideas,” the official said. “He brought over from the FBI a different mind-set. He challenged us in different ways.”

Morgan and McAleenan have remained at odds, and tensions between them peaked over the weekend when the president agreed to call off an ICE roundup of migrant families with deportation orders that Morgan was eager to carry out.

President Trump agreed to postpone the raids in 10 American cities after McAleenan and others at ICE said they would be dangerous to pull off, partially because the president himself had publicly announced the sensitive law enforcement plans in advance on Twitter.

In several days of meetings, McAleenan told the president and other immigration advisers that they doubted they could safely deport the large number of people Trump wanted to target, and that authorities likely would have to resort to putting families in hotel rooms or releasing them again with ankle monitoring devices.

McAleenan also said that operations could be dangerous for agents because some local and state officials in Democratic districts were preparing to thwart the ICE operations.

Trump reluctantly agreed to cancel the raids and decided to couch the decision as a compromise with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advisers said.

But the president has begun complaining to advisers about McAleenan, who also has clashed with White House senior policy adviser and immigration guru Stephen Miller.

In the past two months, the president has ousted the previous acting director of ICE, Ronald Vitiello, fired his DHS secretary, removed the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and named an immigration czar, Tom Homan, who has not accepted the job.

"FTC, Justice Dept. takes coordinated action against robocallers – TechCrunch",https://techcrunch.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/ftc-justice-department-robocall-action/,"Federal authorities have announced its latest crackdown on illegal robocallers — taking close to a hundred actions against several companies and individuals blamed for the recent barrage of spam calls.

In the so-called “Operation Call It Quits,” the Federal Trade Commission brought four cases — two filed on its behalf by the Justice Department — and three settlements in cases said to be responsible for making more than a billion illegal robocalls.

Several state and local authorities also brought actions as part of the operation, officials said.

Each year, billions of automatically dialed or spoofed phone calls trick millions into picking up the phone. An annoyance at least, at worse it tricks unsuspecting victims into turning over cash or buying fake or misleading products. So far, the FTC has fined companies more than $200 million but only collected less than 0.01% of the fines because of the agency’s limited enforcement powers.

In this new wave of action, the FTC said it will send a strong signal to the robocalling industry.

Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Americans are “fed up” with the billions of robocalls received every year. “Today’s joint effort shows that combatting this scourge remains a top priority for law enforcement agencies around the nation,” he said.

It’s the second time the FTC has acted in as many months. In May, the agency also took action against four companies accused of making “billions” of robocalls.

The FTC said its latest action brings the number of robocall violators up to 145.

Several of the cases involved shuttering operations that offer consumers “bogus” credit card interest rate reduction services, which the FTC said specifically targeted seniors. Other cases involved the use of illegal robocalls to promote money-making schemes.

Another cases included actions against Lifewatch, a company pitching medical alert systems, which the FTC contended uses spoofed caller ID information to trick victims into picking up the phone. The company settled for $25.3 million. Meanwhile, Redwood Scientific settled for $18.2 million, suspended due to the inability for defendant Danielle Cadiz to pay, for “deceptively” marketing dentistry products, according to the FTC’s complaint.

The robocalling epidemic has caught the attention of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms and internet industries. Last month, its commissioners proposed a new rule that would make it easier for carriers to block robocalls."
"Veterans Affairs whistleblower notified of termination day before congressional testimony, she says",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years.

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first. The Department of Veterans Affairs did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid-addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond.

Aghevli said the letter was the latest attempt by the department to reprimand her for blowing the whistle back in 2014, when she reported that veterans had been removed improperly from waitlists for opioid-addiction treatment.

""In the span of five years, I've brought up concerns that we were hiding a waitlist, I've brought up very serious patient safety concerns, I've brought up access to care concerns and I've brought up concerns about a patient death,"" Aghevli told ABC News. ""None of those things, even when they've been substantiated, have resulted in any of the other people involved being disciplined.""

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary because it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers. She said she doesn't know, for sure, if there was a ""threat to other staff, but that's a little bit what it feels like.""

Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images, FILE

""So, if what staff see is that the person bringing up those concerns is getting fired, I think the message is pretty clear,"" she said. ""The fact that they're telling me today, right before my testimony, it makes me feel like perhaps they want other people to hear that this happened to me.

""And that's really upsetting. I don't like to be used as a pawn.""

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

She said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits and accordingly. The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.""

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

Aghevli says she was stripped of her patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks"" after reporting her concerns about patient care.

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she added. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation."""

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

A federal appeals court said Tuesday that a Maryland judge should examine new allegations that the Trump administration had a discriminatory intent in adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, on the eve of a possible Supreme Court decision on the matter.

The order was part of last-minute wrangling in the lower courts, the Supreme Court and on Capitol Hill as the justices are set to vote on the issue before the end of their term, presumably this week.

The Supreme Court is considering lower court decisions that said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated administrative law and the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship question of each household. Critics, even in the Census Bureau, believe the question could cause an undercount of millions of people who would be afraid to return the form.

The Maryland case would pose different questions: Whether the addition would violate equal protection guarantees and whether it was part of a conspiracy to drive down the count of minorities.

A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit voted 2 to 1 to send the case back to U.S. District Judge George Hazel so he could consider new evidence that came from the files of a deceased Republican political operative. Thomas Hofeller had been in touch with some Census officials, and wrote a memo that said adding the question might help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions based on the census data.

And even as the Supreme Court decision neared, one judge on the panel suggested Hazel order the question be put on hold while that was hashed out.

“A preliminary injunction may be necessary to prevent the printing of the Census questionnaire from, at least from the government’s perspective, rendering the case moot,” wrote Circuit Judge James A. Wynn Jr.

Some Census officials have said a decision is needed by the end of June in order to print the forms; others have said the absolute deadline is in the fall.

Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, said in a letter to the Supreme Court that the justices should not be deterred from making a decision in the case.

The claims in the Maryland case are “meritless,” Francisco wrote, and “based on a speculative conspiracy theory that is unsupported by the evidence and legally irrelevant to demonstrating that Secretary Ross acted with a discriminatory intent.”

Challengers of the citizenship question have asked the justices to put their deliberations on hold and let Hazel and a judge in New York consider the new evidence. They noted in a letter to the court that Hazel in an order on Monday said the new allegations “potentially connects the dots between a discriminatory purpose” and Ross’s decision.

Meanwhile, a House panel released information Tuesday that it says “points to a partisan and discriminatory effort” behind the Trump administration’s move to add the question.

In a memo to members of the House Oversight Committee, the panel’s Democratic staff said that James Uthmeier, a former senior adviser and counsel to Ross, had refused to answer “dozens of questions” but that he had nonetheless “confirmed key information” about the effort to add the citizenship question.

“Mr. Uthmeier disclosed that Secretary Ross directed him to begin examining the citizenship question within weeks of being sworn in as Secretary and that they had multiple conversations about it well before any request came from DOJ — erasing any doubt about the inaccuracy of Secretary Ross’ claim that he added the citizenship question ‘solely’ at DOJ’s request,” the memo reads.

Ross originally told Congress that his decision to add the question came solely in response to a December 2017 Justice Department request, but lawsuits later produced emails showing that Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had been pushing for the question for months before that.

The Justice Department dismissed the allegations that it hid the government’s true motives earlier this month, calling them “frivolous.”

In a statement, a Commerce Department spokesman argued that the panel’s summary of Uthmeier’s interview “mischaracterizes what he said on multiple topics.” He did not immediately respond to a question on what specific aspects of Uthmeier’s remarks the department believes were mischaracterized.

“In addition, Mr. Uthmeier, a former senior Department attorney, answered over 400 questions but declined, consistent with his ethical obligations, to discuss privileged communications,” the spokesman said. “That was entirely appropriate.”

The Oversight Committee voted this month to hold two Cabinet officials — Ross and Attorney General William P. Barr — in contempt of Congress in connection with the administration’s efforts to shield documents related to its decision to add the citizenship question.

The panel is recommending a full House vote on contempt, although the timing of such a vote remains unclear.

In a statement issued Tuesday morning, the panel’s chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), said the Trump administration “claimed that the only reason it wanted to add the citizenship question was to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act, but that claim has now been exposed as a pretext.”

“Official after official appearing before the Committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-Whites,” he said.

The oversight panel released transcripts Tuesday of interviews with four people on the matter. They include Uthmeier; John Gore, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division; Gene Hamilton, a former DOJ and Department of Homeland Security official; and Kris Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state who once headed Trump’s voter integrity commission.

Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper sends first memo to troops as Pentagon boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-defense-secretary-mark-esper-memo-troops-pentagon,"On his first day on the job as the new acting secretary of defense, Mark Esper on Monday sent a memorandum to all Pentagon employees, laying out the Defense Department’s “path forward.”

In the memo, titled “Initial Message to the Department,” Esper wrote, “As we continue to advance the Nation’s security, let me reaffirm our path forward. The National Defense Strategy remains our guiding document and everything we do should support its stated objectives.”

Esper was named the new acting secretary of defense by President Trump last Tuesday after Patrick Shanahan withdrew his nomination.

WHO IS MARK ESPER, TRUMP'S NEW ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PICK?

Esper, 56, has served as the 23rd secretary of the United States Army since Nov. 17, 2017. His duties included the recruitment, organization, training, equipping and care of 1.4 million active duty, National Guard, Reserve Soldiers, Department of the Army Civilians and their families, according to his Pentagon biography.

Esper said Monday the department’s priorities would “remain unchanged” and everything the department did “should support its stated objectives.”

He then went on to explain “three mutually reinforcing lines of effort” used to continue to expand the competitive space. They included building ""a more lethal force,"" strengthening alliances and attracting new partners, as well as reforming the department ""for greater performance and affordability.""

In his memo, Esper explained that building a more lethal force would be the “surest way to deter adversary aggression” and included fully preparing for war. He wrote that it’s important to “continue to build readiness to fight” while “modernizing key capabilities for future conflict.”

Esper explained that U.S. allies and partners “play an essential role in helping us deter conflict and defend freedom around the world.” He added that through continued engagement the country will “grow these relationships and deepen our interoperability.”

Esper graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1986. He received his commission in the infantry and completed Ranger and Pathfinder training.

He served on active duty for over a decade. In the early '90s, he served with the 101st Airborne Division in the Gulf War. He later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe.

Following his service on active duty, he served in both the Virginia and District of Columbia National Guard and Army Reserve. He retired in 2007.

“Having previously served in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve, I understand well the sacrifices our Service Members, Civilians, and their Families make to protect this great country,” Esper wrote in the memo. “This is why I am committed to taking care of Families and ensuring they have the resources they need to thrive.”

He encouraged soldiers, sailors, airmen marines and civilians to stay focused on their mission and “always do the right thing.”

“Together, we will remain the most ready and capable military force in the world, which is what our nation expects and deserves,” Esper said.

New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerNew EPA rule would expand Trump officials' powers to reject FOIA requests Overnight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John TrumpNew EPA rule would expand Trump officials' powers to reject FOIA requests Democratic senator introduces bill to ban gun silencers Democrats: Ex-Commerce aide said Ross asked him to examine adding census citizenship question MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsNew EPA rule would expand Trump officials' powers to reject FOIA requests Democrats: Ex-Commerce aide said Ross asked him to examine adding census citizenship question White House to block Conway from testifying over alleged Hatch Act violations MORE (Md.), who at the time was the panel’s top Democrat and is now chairman, accused the EPA of impeding requests.

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/commerce-house-panel-questions-1380209,"James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (pictured), was instructed not to answer questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.

Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.

10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""
VA health care workers say managers are trying to silence them on veteran care,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/25/veterans-affairs-health-care-workers-say-punished-speaking-out/1549658001/,"CLOSE Radiology technologist Jeff Dettbarn, alleges thousands of tests at the Iowa City VA were improperly canceled, potentially risking veterans’ lives. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Health care professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday that they are being punished for reporting problems with VA care, to the detriment of veterans and despite proclamations by the Trump administration that whistleblowers are celebrated and not scorned.

A physician from the Phoenix area, a psychologist from Baltimore and a CT technologist from Iowa City, Iowa, said they believe managers retaliated against them and tried to stop them from disclosing more issues at VA medical centers.

Their claims, first made in interviews with USA TODAY last week, contradict assertions by agency leaders and President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order and a law creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within months of taking office. The office, he said, would ""make sure that they're protected.""

The VA inspector general has since launched an investigation of the office's handling of whistleblower cases. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year raised concerns about the office allowing employees accused of wrongdoing by whistleblowers to be involved in investigating the accusations.

The employees who testified Tuesday have a track record of raising concerns about VA health care – and all three have been stripped of patient care and oversight duties.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell reported inadequate training and triage in the emergency room of the Phoenix VA. Psychologist Minu Aghevli reported improper removal of veterans from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA. CT tech Jeff Dettbarn revealed administrators had mass-canceled diagnostic test orders at the Iowa City VA without determining if veterans still needed the tests.

Dettbarn has been assigned to paperwork duties since his revelations in 2017, Aghevli was transferred to a data entry post in April and Mitchell has been kept from patient safety issues and oversight for nearly five years.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out has sent a signal to other VA employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

Aghevli likewise said she feels her treatment is ""being used as a threat against other employees"" and has a ""chilling effect"" on their speaking up about problems.

“It has a terrible effect on veterans,” she said.

""For every person who wants to speak up, there are thousands that have tried, only to be removed, demoted, (and) silence(d),"" Dettbarn said.

They recommended that more resources and staff be provided to an outside federal agency that helps whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, and an independent board that vets employee disciplinary appeals. They called for an overhaul of the Trump-created office.

Jacqueline Garrick, founder of nonprofit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, testified that they are not alone – almost 200 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 complaining of retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency.

""VA employees are ignored, attacked,"" she said, adding that the VA whistleblower office has not been the solution. ""Instead, it causes more harm,"" Garrick said.

Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project, another nonprofit group that helps whistleblowers, said the office lacks comprehensive regulations and works on an ""ad hoc"" basis.

""This maximizes confusion and enables arbitrary action,"" Devine said.

VA spokesman Randall Noller told USA TODAY last week that an assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/agriculture-department-climate-change-1376413,"President Donald Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have both expressed skepticism about climate change and appear to have suppressed research efforts on the topic. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo POLITICO Investigation Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change The Trump administration has stopped promoting government-funded research into how higher temperatures can damage crops and pose health risks.

The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.

The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment — a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice — to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.

Story Continued Below

All of these studies were peer-reviewed by scientists and cleared through the non-partisan Agricultural Research Service, one of the world’s leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.

The administration, researchers said, appears to be trying to limit the circulation of evidence of climate change and avoid press coverage that may raise questions about the administration’s stance on the issue.

“The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves.”

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past and allegedly retaliated against in-house economists whose findings contradicted administration policies, declined to comment. A spokesperson for USDA said there have been no directives within the department that discouraged the dissemination of climate-related science.

“Research continues on these subjects and we promote the research once researchers are ready to announce the findings, after going through the appropriate reviews and clearances,” the spokesperson said in an email.

“USDA has several thousand scientists and over 100,000 employees who work on myriad topics and issues; not every single finding or piece of work solicits a government press release,” the spokesperson added.

However, a POLITICO investigation revealed a persistent pattern in which the Trump administration refused to draw attention to findings that show the potential dangers and consequences of climate change, covering dozens of separate studies. The administration’s moves flout decades of department practice of promoting its research in the spirit of educating farmers and consumers around the world, according to an analysis of USDA communications under previous administrations.

The lack of promotion means research from scores of government scientists receives less public attention. Climate-related studies are still being published without fanfare in scientific journals, but they can be very difficult to find. The USDA doesn’t post all its studies in one place.

Since Trump took office in January 2017, the Agricultural Research Service has issued releases for just two climate-related studies, both of which had findings that were favorable to the politically powerful meat industry. One found that beef production makes a relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and another that removing animal products from the diet for environmental reasons would likely cause widespread nutritional problems. The agency issued a third press release about soy processing that briefly mentioned greenhouse gas emissions, noting that reducing fossil fuel use or emissions was “a personal consideration” for farmers.

By contrast, POLITICO found that in the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency’s research partners.

Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.

The study had undergone intensive review, addressing questions from academic peers and within USDA itself. But after having prepared an announcement of the findings, the department abruptly decided not to publicize the study and urged the University of Washington to hold back its own release on the findings, which two of their researchers had co-authored.

In an email to staffers dated May 7, 2018, an incredulous Jeff Hodson, a UW communications director, advised his colleagues that the USDA communications office was “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science.”

""It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: ‘Don't do a press release,’ "" Hodson recalled in an interview. ""We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people.""

Researchers say the failure to publicize their work damages the credibility of the Agriculture Department and represents an unwarranted political intrusion into science.

“Why the hell is the U.S., which is ostensibly the leader in science research, ignoring this?” said one USDA scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the possibility of retaliation. “It’s not like we’re working on something that’s esoteric … we’re working on something that has dire consequences for the entire planet.”

“You can only postpone reality for so long,” the researcher added.

With a budget of just over $1 billion, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service — known as ARS — is often referred to as “one of the best kept secrets” in the sprawling department because of its outsize impact on society. The agency has pioneered a variety of major breakthroughs, from figuring out how to mass produce penicillin so it could be widely used during World War II to coming up with creative ways to keep sliced apples from browning, and has for decades been at the forefront of understanding how a changing climate will affect agriculture.

The agency has stringent guidelines to prevent political meddling in research projects themselves. The Trump administration, researchers say, is not directly censoring scientific findings or black-balling research on climate change. Instead, they say, officials are essentially choosing to ignore or downplay findings that don’t line up with the administration’s agenda.

Some scientists see the fact that the administration has targeted another research arm of USDA, the Economic Research Service, as a warning shot. Perdue is moving ERS out of Washington, which some economists see as retribution for issuing reports that countered the administration’s agenda, as POLITICO recently reported.

“There’s a sense that you should watch what you say,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s going to result in some pretty big gaps in practical knowledge. … it will take years to undo the damage.”

Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:



A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.

A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on the waning Ogallala aquifer to the cattle that graze the grasslands.

An April 2018 finding that elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle. The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.

A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.

An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.

A March 2019 finding that increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere. “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.

Those were among at least 45 ARS studies related to climate change since the beginning of the Trump administration that did not receive any promotion, according to POLITICO’s review. The total number of studies that have published on climate-related issues is likely to be larger, because ARS studies appear across a broad range of narrowly focused journals and can be difficult to locate.

Five days after POLITICO presented its findings to the department and asked for a response, ARS issued a press release on wheat genetics that used the term “climate change.” It marked the third time the agency had used the term in a press release touting scientific findings in two and a half years.

While spokespeople say Perdue, the former Georgia governor who has been agriculture secretary since April 2017, has not interfered with ARS or the dissemination of its studies, the secretary has recently suggested that he’s at times been frustrated with USDA research.

“We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers,” he said in April, responding to a question from POLITICO. “That relies on sound, replicable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has been clear about his views on climate science and agricultural research generally: He doesn’t think much of either.

In each of his budgets, Trump has proposed deep cuts to agricultural research, requests that ignore a broad, bipartisan coalition urging more funding for such science as China and other competitors accelerate their spending. Congress has so far kept funding mostly flat.

The president has also repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. After the government released its latest national climate assessment in November, a sweeping document based on science, Trump bluntly told reporters: ""I don't believe it.""

Officials at USDA apparently took the hint and the department did not promote the report, despite the fact that it was drafted in part by its own scientists and included serious warnings about how a changing climate poses a threat to farmers and ranchers across the country.

The USDA’s failure to publicize climate-related research does more than just quell media coverage: It can also prompt universities, fearful of antagonizing a potential source of funding, to reconsider their own plans to publicize studies.

The saga of the rice study last spring shows how a snub from USDA can create spillover effects throughout the academic world.

Emails obtained by POLITICO from one of the study’s co-authors show that ARS communications staff actually wrote a release on the study, but then decided not to send it out. The Agriculture Department and UW in Seattle had initially planned to coordinate their releases, which would both be included in a press packet prepared by the journal Science Advances, which published the study in May.

The journal had anticipated there would be significant media interest in the paper. Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.

Several days before the paper was slated to be published, Hodson, the UW communications official, sent ARS communications staff a draft of the press release the university was planning to send out. ARS officials returned the favor, sending UW their own draft press release. The headline on USDA’s draft was clear: “Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Can Reduce Vitamin Content in Rice,” though the body of the release did not mention the word “climate.”

All seemed to be on track for the rollout. A few days later, however, Hodson got a phone call from an ARS communications staffer. She told him that the agency had decided not to issue a press release after all and suggested UW reconsider its plans, noting that senior leaders at ARS now had serious concerns about the paper, according to the emails.

The staffer explained that officials were “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science,” Hodson wrote in his email to his colleagues shortly after the call.

Having the Agriculture Department question the data just days before its publication struck many of the co-authors as inappropriate. The paper had already gone through a technical and policy review within ARS, both of which are standard procedure, and it had gone through a stringent peer-review process.

Kristie Ebi, one of the co-authors from UW, replied to Hodson: “Interesting — USDA is really trying to keep the press release from coming out.”

Nonetheless, senior leaders at UW took USDA’s concerns about the paper seriously, Hodson said. (It also wasn’t lost on anyone, he said, that other parts of the university receive substantial grant funding from the Agriculture Department.) The university conducted an internal review and determined that the science was sound. It went ahead with its press release.

The USDA’s attempt to quash the release had ripple effects as far as Nebraska. After catching wind of USDA’s call to the University of Washington, Bryan College of Health Sciences, in Lincoln, Neb., delayed and ultimately shortened its own release to avoid potentially offending the Agriculture Department.

“I’m disappointed,” said Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist at Bryan who co-authored the rice paper. “I do not even work at the USDA, but a potential call from the government agency was enough of a threat for my school to skip participating in the press-package arranged by the journal. Instead, our college issued a local and abbreviated release.""

A spokesperson for Bryan College said that the institution supports Loladze’s work and noted that the college ultimately issued its own press release and covered the study in its own publications.

“There was no omission or intentional delay based on what others were saying or doing,” the spokesperson said.

Despite the efforts of the Agriculture Department, the rice paper attracted substantial international press coverage, largely because many of the outside institutions that collaborated on the study, including the University of Tokyo, promoted it.

Kazuhiko Kobayashi, an agricultural scientist at the University of Tokyo and co-author on the paper, said he couldn’t understand why the U.S. government wouldn’t publicize such findings.

“It’s not necessarily bad for USDA,” he said in an interview. “Actually, it’s kind of neutral.”

“In Japan we have an expression: sontaku,” he said, offering his own speculation about the political dynamic in the United States. “It means that you don’t want to stimulate your boss … you feel you cannot predict your boss’s reaction.”

A USDA spokesperson said the decision to spike the press release on the rice study was driven by a scientific disagreement, not by the fact that it was climate-related.

“The concern was about nutritional claims, not anything relating to climate change or C02 levels,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency. They felt that the data do not support this.”

The spokesperson said no political appointees were involved in the decision.

Authors of the rice study strongly disagreed with the concerns USDA raised about their paper. In an email leading up to publication, Loladze, the Bryan College researcher, accused the department of essentially “cherry picking” data to raise issues that weren’t scientifically valid, according to the emails.

When the Agriculture Department chooses to promote a study, the impact can be significant, particularly for the agriculture-focused news outlets that are widely read by farmers and ranchers.

Earlier this year, when the agency decided to issue its release about the study finding that producing beef — often criticized for having an outsize carbon and water footprint — actually makes up a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural trade press cranked out several stories, much to the delight of the beef industry. The study had also been supported by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

The USDA’s efforts to hide climate work aren’t limited to ARS. A review of department press releases, blog posts and social media shows a clear pattern of avoiding the topic. These platforms largely eschew the term “climate change” and also steer clear of climate-related terms. Even the word “climate” itself appears to have now fallen out of favor, along with phrases like carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation and sequestration.

In April, for example, USDA sent out a press release noting that USDA officials had signed on to a communique on the sidelines of a G-20 agricultural scientists' meeting that reaffirmed their commitment to “science-based decision making.” The release made no mention of the fact that most of the principles USDA had agreed to were actually related to “climate-smart” agriculture.

Scott Hutchins, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, told POLITICO at the time that he emphasized science-based decision-making in the release — not climate — because that was the strength the participants brought to these international dialogues. He added that there was “no intent whatsoever” to avoid including the words “climate smart” in the release.

A spokesperson for USDA said that department leadership “has not discouraged ARS or any USDA agency from using terms such as climate change, climate, or carbon sequestration, or from highlighting work on these topics.”

But David Festa, senior vice president of ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, which works with farmers and ranchers on climate mitigation, said tensions within the USDA over climate issues are preventing a more robust discussion of the effects of climate change on American agriculture.

“USDA really could and should be leading … and they’re not,” Festa said.

Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer whose operation is roughly half conventional, half organic grain, said farmers are simply not getting much information from USDA related to how to adapt to or mitigate climate change.

“My farmers tell me this is frustrating,” said Lehman, who serves as Iowa Farmers Union President.

The gap in the conversation is particularly pronounced right now, he said, as an unprecedented percentage of growers across the Midwest have had difficulty planting their crops because fields are either too wet or flooded — an extreme weather scenario that’s been disastrous for agriculture this year.

“Farmers have a sense that the volatility is getting worse,” he said.

“You get the sense that it’s very sensitive,” Lehman said of the current dynamic around climate science at USDA. “But if you can’t have an open conversation about it, if you feel like you’re being shunned, how are we going to make progress?”



* * *

Even during the George W. Bush administration, when climate change was first deemed a “sensitive” topic within ARS — a designation that means science and other documents related to it require an extra layer of managerial clearance — the department still routinely highlighted climate-related research for the public.

In the first three years of Bush’s second term, for example, USDA promoted research on how farmers can change their tilling practices to reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere, a look at how various farm practices help capture carbon into soil, and a forecast on how rising CO2 levels would likely affect key crops. The communications office highlighted work showing that using switchgrass as a biofuel in lieu of ethanol could store more carbon in soil, which would not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also boost soil health. There was also a release on a study simulating how climate change would pose challenges to groundwater.

Under Bush, the department publicly launched a five-year project on “Climate Friendly Farming” and touted a sweeping initiative aimed at better understanding and reducing agriculture’s greenhouse emissions.

“Even a small increase in the amount of carbon stored per acre of farmland would have a large effect on offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,” an ARS release noted in 2005.

Jim Connaughton, who served as chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy during the Bush administration, said he was encouraged that USDA and other agencies have so far been able to continue conducting climate science even as the issue has become more politically sensitive within the current administration. However, he noted it was “really unusual” for research agencies to systematically hold back scientific communication.

During the Bush era, he said, “The agencies were unfettered in their own decisions about publicizing their own science.”

“The tone from the top matters,” he added. “The political appointees are taking signals about their own communication products.”

During the Obama years, USDA became increasingly outspoken about climate change and the need to involve agriculture, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.

The department came up with sweeping action plans on climate change and climate science and highlighted its work on a number of different platforms, including press releases, blog posts and social media blasts. In 2014, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also launched Climate Hubs in 10 regions across the country aimed at helping farmers and ranchers cope with an increasingly unpredictable climate.

“We were trying to take science and make it real and actionable for farmers,” said Robert Bonnie, who served as undersecretary for natural resources and the environment at USDA during the Obama administration. “If you’re taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place.”"
Justice Department Border Video: More to Do with Obama than Trump,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['A. G. Hamilton', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'David French', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Ramesh Ponnuru', 'Jack Crowe', 'Kathryn Jean Lopez', 'Read More']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/what-the-viral-border-patrol-video-leaves-out/,"(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

News outlets seized on the video as evidence of the Trump administration’s cruelty, but they omitted the crucial context.

In an attempt to justify Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s absurd comparison of American detention facilities to Holocaust-era concentration camps, many figures within the media have shared a viral video clip of a legal hearing in which a Department of Justice attorney debates a panel of judges as to what constitutes “sanitary conditions.” The majority of the shares were of a version put out by NowThis News, which claimed that the video shows a Trump administration official arguing that “children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.” The claim has led to several days of outrage, and has been used repeatedly as evidence that the current administration is being intentionally cruel to migrant children. Countless journalists, along with clickbait outlets such as The Hill and the Huffington Post , have highlighted the video inside this framing.

Unsurprisingly, it is not that simple. Indeed, the hearing in the video was related not to actions taken by the Trump administration, but to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that the CBP under the Obama administration had violated the Flores Settlement agreement with its treatment of children in custody. The judge in that case cited specific infractions that she felt were in violation of the “safe and sanitary” requirement under the Flores agreement and recommended a special monitor be appointed to ensure these facilities were complying with the original standard. The DOJ attorney in the video, Sarah Fabian, was not arguing that the United States should decline to provide those items to children, but rather that the Flores Settlement agreement didn’t specifically require those items. The notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit judges disagreed with this argument, preferring to read Flores narrowly. Fabian has been arguing similar cases on behalf of the Justice Department for years; that is her job. Some of her legal arguments have upset immigration advocates before. But they have never led to this type of media coverage, or to the claim that her fulfilling her legal role is indicative of a moral shortcoming.

Predictably, the vast majority of the people and the outlets that shared this exchange failed to note that the violations being discussed had occurred during the previous administration, while those who did know failed to ask themselves (and others) why the violations didn’t receive similar coverage when they were first exposed. Instead, they jumped straight to the conclusion that the federal government, headed up by President Trump, was deliberately inflicting pain on babies. This isn’t true.

It wasn’t true during the Obama administration either. Then, as now, the violations weren’t part of an intentional or evil ploy, but were the product of the system’s being overloaded. Then, as now, the intended care at these facilities was humane, and consistent within the requirement under Flores. In 2014, the Obama administration was dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strained the facilities. In 2019, the Trump administration is dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strains the facilities. In consequence, across multiple years and multiple administrations, the DOJ has repeatedly argued in court that the Flores Settlement agreement should be read narrowly, or allow for exceptions in difficult times. Certainly, governments make mistakes. Certainly, some facilities have taken shortcuts, as the result of either bureaucratic incompetence or limited resources. But those infractions will be fixed by additional funding, additional facilities, better oversight, and quicker processing, not by pretending that the president is a tyrant. The situation at the border is a difficult one, but selective outrage based on misleading facts won’t do much to address it.

This incident has been reminiscent of the recent outrage over pictures of “kids in cages” at detention facilities that, after a period, were revealed to date from the Obama administration. And, like that one, it has done a great deal of damage to our institutions, not only because it seems to neutral observers that the media gauges newsworthiness based on who is in the White House, but because the selective coverage and focus on imagined motives rather than real structural problems permits members of Congress to deflect from their own inaction, and thereby to ensure that the issues will continue ad nauseam."
Why weak leadership at the Defense Department could lead us to war in Iran,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael J. Stricof', 'Michael J.

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."
Democrats demand answers from USDA on lack of climate science promotion,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/24/democrats-usda-climate-science-1378853,"Sen.

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

The Trump Administration’s attempts to suppress climate science are unacceptable. This isn’t a political game — this is the livelihoods and futures of farmers & ranchers across the country.

""Our farmers and ranchers know as well as anyone the devastating effects of climate change, because they're living with the realities of droughts in places like Colorado and floods in places like Iowa,"" he said.

Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur, tweeted the story soon after it posted Sunday evening: ""Suppressing scientific research and findings is the opposite of what we should be doing.""

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"
"Homeland Security, other federal agencies remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, Senate panel finds",https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190625/homeland-security-other-federal-agencies-remain-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-senate-panel-finds,"The Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has found.

WASHINGTON — Federal government offices are wildly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.

But those being attacked are doing very little to protect themselves, according to the results of a 10-month Senate investigation of eight federal agencies.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, found that the Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, leaving them susceptible to cyberattack and Americans’ personal information vulnerable to theft.

The problems range from systems so antiquated that they can’t be updated with new security patches to agencies that year after year fail to protect the personal information of millions of Americans.

Get the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our politics newsletter

The subcommittee studied 10 years’ worth of government audits of the IT systems of the Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education departments and the Social Security Administration.

Their investigation comes after a surge in data breaches in the federal government, with agencies including the Postal Service, the IRS and the White House reporting attacks.

In 2015, for example, a hacker broke into government databases to gain access to 22 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.

In 2017 alone, federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents.

Federal agencies often have access to sensitive information because of the very nature of what they do.

The Department of Education collects financial data on students and parents applying for college loans.

Disabled Americans must provide years of health records to prove they are entitled to disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

And homeowners must provide payroll and savings information to HUD to qualify for home loans.

Congress tasked agencies with securing their information technology networks as far back as 2002, and asked each agency’s inspector general to annually audit compliance with basic cybersecurity standards.

But the subcommittee found that most of the agencies studied were failing to comply with even the most basic standards, including properly protecting personally identifiable information.

Five agencies did not maintain a comprehensive and accurate list of IT assets, meaning they had no idea which applications were operating on their networks.

All eight agencies failed to install security patches and other updates to prevent their systems from being vulnerable to attack.

In the most recent audits, seven of the eight agencies failed to provide for the adequate protection of personally identifiable information.

And all of the agencies used legacy systems that were so old that vendors no longer support or issue updates to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Homeland Security, for example, uses Windows 2003 on some of its systems.

The setup used by HUD to initiate and track loan-case numbers and associated data is so old that lenders are unable to submit loan applications electronically and must instead send hard copies through the mail.

In some cases, Social Security’s system to hold retirement and disability information on millions of Americans uses a programming language developed in the 1950s and 1960s — a language that will become increasingly obsolete as the IT professionals who know the language retire.

Some of the agencies are particularly susceptible to attack. The Department of Education, for example, has been unable to prevent unauthorized outside devices from easily connecting to the agency’s network since 2011.

In its 2018 audit, that department’s inspector general found that it had been able to restrict unauthorized access to 90 seconds — still enough time for a hacker to “launch an attack or gain intermittent access to internal network resources that could lead to” exposing the agency’s data.

Portman said federal agencies “have failed at implementing basic cybersecurity practices, leaving classified, personal and sensitive information unsafe and vulnerable to theft.”

“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” he said.

The report makes a list of recommendations aimed at securing government IT systems. Among them are ones urging federal agencies to consolidate security processes and capabilities in order to better detect cybersecurity incidents and another calling on each agency to give broader authority and latitude to their chief information officer to make organization-wide decisions regarding cybersecurity.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, the ranking member of the subcommittee, said the Office of Management and Budget — the agency responsible for cybersecurity efforts across government — “must provide the necessary leadership to ensure that agencies are staying vigilant and prioritizing good cybersecurity practices.”

“We know that the threats posed by cyberattacks continue to evolve and grow every day, so it is crucial that agencies across our government prioritize efforts to better protect their networks from hackers,” he said.

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

Fong’s announcement comes after the House Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill for the USDA this month that — if passed by the House and Senate — would require a more extensive data review by her office before funding can be used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. On Monday, DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

There are two principal complaints, as related in the New York Times and The New Republic. The Trump administration is inconsistent on human rights, giving a pass to allies such as Saudi Arabia while coming down hard on adversaries such as Iran. And the commission will try to push a narrow theocratic conception of human rights, one that scants gay rights and the right to abortion.

The first complaint is correct, but not distinctive to President Trump. No administration is or can be entirely consistent on human rights. . . . The U.S. has a lot of interests and they cannot always be simultaneously pursued. The Barack Obama administration was softer than Trump on Iran and harder on Saudi Arabia, in keeping with its own larger foreign-policy aims.

USDA Confirms Silage Corn Can Be Planted On Prevent Plant Acres,https://www.dairyherd.com,['Anna-Lisa Laca'],,,,https://www.dairyherd.com/article/usda-confirms-silage-corn-can-be-planted-prevent-plant-acres,"This week, farmers in much of the eastern Corn Belt will be eligible to plant cover crops as the late-plant period on prevent plant acres ends there on June 26. Following last week’s announcement about the potential to harvest cover crops on September 1 instead of November 1 many farmers, particularly in the upper Midwest, started to wonder if silage corn would be eligible. According to Richard Flournoy, deputy administrator of product management for the USDA-Risk Management Agency (RMA), silage corn can be eligible for planting on prevent plant acres.

“A cover crop for crop insurance purposes, we have a broad definition, and it's generally many things that any crop that can be planted for erosion control, soil improvement, or any other type of conservation practice,” he told AgriTalk host Chip Flory.

If producers have questions about what could be considered a cover crop in their state, Flournoy suggests a visit to the local National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) office. Individual states can have a list of what crops can be considered cover crops.

Additionally, he says an “ag expert” can deem a crop eligible by determining the prospective crop meets all the cover crop definitions.

“We have on our website a link to all the folks who can be considered an expert,” he said. “A certified crop advisor is [someone] that could say in your area, corn for silage could be a cover crop. One key distinction there is it can't be corn for grain or seed, as long as it's for silage it meets that cover crop definition.”"

Jeff Alson was sitting in his apartment in Ann Arbor, Mich., when he felt like he was going to explode.

The retired environmental engineer, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for 40 years, had just read a letter written by one of his old bosses, agency chief Andrew Wheeler.

In it, Wheeler told Congress that EPA career experts had not been cut out of the process of crafting one of the Trump administration's most controversial environmental proposals to date — one that would abandon one of President Barack Obama's signature climate policies.

Alson was one of those EPA experts before retiring in April 2018. He was fuming, he later said, because he believed what Wheeler was saying was wrong.

“I gave myself five minutes,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Friday. “I sat there and tried to calm down. But I said, 'You know what? Enough is enough.' ""

Alson is speaking out at a moment of rising tension between Trump officials and California regulators as the federal government prepares to freeze in place pollution rules for new cars and light trucks for the next six years — rather than ratchet them up to rein in carbon emissions as the Obama administration wanted to do.

Wheeler and Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, spent Thursday trading barbs after failed negotiations to allow California to keep its waiver allowing the state to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act, a practice the federal government has sanctioned for decades.

In prepared testimony, Nichols told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that in more than a dozen meetings with federal officials, “the Trump Administration has been unwilling to find a way” toward a resolution between with California.

She also said that “U.S. EPA’s professional staff and California’s engineers were cut out of this proposal’s development.”

Responding in his own letter to lawmakers, Wheeler said Nichols never offered a counterproposal and accused Nichols of not being “a good faith actor in this rulemaking.” He added that ""[h]er testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false.”

It was that last statement that got Alson's blood boiling.

“I can speak from direct experience that Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying,” he said.

According to Alson, under previous administrations technical staff at the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Transportation Department, would spend hours ironing out details of how fuel-efficiency standards should work before the agencies jointly rolled out the tailpipe rules for new cars.

But Alson said before the Trump administration's proposal was rolled out, there were no such technical meetings between the technical staffs of NHTSA and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, the EPA's state-of-the-art facility in Michigan where investigators helped uncover the Volkswagen emissions scandal and where Alson worked for decades.

Instead, he said, there were only a few what he calls “check-the-box"" meetings between the agencies in early 2018.

“NHTSA was unwilling to tell EPA what they were doing,” Alson said. “At the end of the day, they completely controlled every piece of analysis.”

During a joint hearing of two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees Thursday, Democrats grilled the EPA’s air policy chief, Bill Wehrum, about his office's involvement in the proposal.

“Was it accurate that they had little involvement in the process?” said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), referring to the Office of Air and Radiation.

“Through the course of this rulemaking, EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum responded.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud reiterated the points made in Wheeler's letter. “The letter speaks for itself,” Abboud said. “Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule.”

But documents released in the rulemaking process last year show bitter disagreement between the two agencies over the logic of the move.

The Transportation Department agency said that upping car mileage per gallon make new cars more expensive and lead to consumers putting off purchases. That, in turn, would mean more older cars on the road that would not perform well in accidents and more auto fatalities.

An internal EPA analysis at the time, however, found that not going through with the Obama-era rules would lead to slightly more fatalities. At one point, the disagreement became so pronounced that an EPA staffer asked for the agency's name and logo to be removed from a key regulatory report.

California and other states have vowed to challenge the freezing of the fuel-efficiency standards in court once they are finalized. If the EPA's technical staff were cut out of the process, as Alson contends, that may provide fodder for a lawsuit.

“The Clean Air Act requires EPA to be 'the decider' for its own rules, so IF it could be clearly shown in the record that EPA relinquished decision-making authority to NHTSA, that could be a problem for EPA in the courts,” Jody Freeman, director of Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program, wrote by email.

Alson said he is going public now because most of his former colleagues still work at the agency and can't “set the record straight” without fear of reprimand.

“I felt a responsibility to do that because I'm the only person who could stand up and do that,” he said. “Everybody else who still works there can't say that.”

— Jay Inslee releases another climate plan: This latest one from the Washington governor and climate-focused candidate for president aims to end subsidies for fossil-fuel production, ban new federal fossil-fuel leasing, restrict drilling and mining under existing leases and create a new office in the Justice Department to prosecute polluters. The plan, released Monday morning, earned early praise from environmentalists. ""I'm really heartened by Jay Inslee's commitment to tell hard truths to fossil fuel industries, and in offering a truly comprehensive climate plan for American voters,"" said RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote.

— White House unveils draft guidance on how agencies must account for climate change: The White House Council on Environmental Quality issued draft guidance Friday telling federal agencies they no longer have to take long-term climate impacts into account when reviewing how projects affect the environment.. The proposal means agencies “no longer have to take a project’s long-term climate impacts into account when assessing how they will affect the environment,” The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports. The guidance reverses an April 2016 directive that agencies must quantify their long-term contribution to climate change.

But: Legal experts warn the new guidance: ""could cause further problems for the administration in court, where judges have suggested officials need to do a better job of assessing the climate impact of their decisions,"" Eilperin writes.

— Standoff continues in Oregon: After Republican senators walked out of the state capitol last week to avoid a vote on a climate change bill, the GOP members were absent again on Sunday.

One Republican state senator, Cliff Bentz, told the Oregonian in a phone interview from somewhere in Idaho that he’s glad there is increased attention around “one of the biggest issues of our time,” meaning climate change, and the party’s concern with the Democratic-backed cap-and-trade bill. The Post’s Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler reported Friday the state capitol was shut down because of credible threats from militia groups. “Friday night’s menacing escalation was the latest in a bizarre feud between the state’s Democrats and Republicans, who have clashed repeatedly during this year’s legislative session,” they write.

Why this is happening now: “Democrats have a supermajority in Oregon, allowing them the rare opportunity to pass the legislation of their dreams — but without Republicans, they can’t achieve a quorum,” Thebault and Brice-Saddler report. “No quorum, no vote. GOP senators said they had two options: allow a bill that they said would devastate their constituents to pass, or make a run for it.”

— Court strikes down federal approval for Cadiz pipeline: A federal judge has thrown out approval that the Bureau of Land Management under President Trump granted to Cadiz Inc. to build a water pipeline across public land in California. The agency under Trump reversed a 2015 decision by the Obama administration to say Cadiz could not use the existing railroad right of way across federal land, the Los Angeles Times reports.

— Climate-related studies blocked: The Trump administration has blocked the release of dozens of government-funded studies that warn about various climate-related dangers — all peer-reviewed and cleared by scientists at the non-partisan Agriculture Research Service, Politico reports.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said there have been no such orders within the agency to stop the promotion of climate science. “The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment … to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle,” per the report. “None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.”

— Supreme Court sides with property owners: The high court sided in a 5-to-4 decision with a Pennsylvania woman in a case involving land-use regulations, overturning a precedent that required landowners to bring claims against local governments in state court before going to federal court. The ruling is “likely to have ripple effects on land use and environmental regulations,” E&E News reports. “[Chief Justice John Roberts] reasoned that landowners have a claim under the Fifth Amendment — which bars the government from taking property without compensation — as soon as the taking occurs and therefore have access to federal court right away.”

THERMOMETER

— A proposed wildfire fund in California: In an effort to assist utilities in the state and protect ratepayers from the rising costs associated with liability claims after catastrophic wildfires, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has proposed a new wildfire fund. The money for the $21 billion fund would be generated by $10.5 billion from extending an existing charge on utility customer bills, the Los Angeles Times reports, as well as $10.5 billion matched by investor-owned utilities. “The proposal stops short of meeting investor demands that the state change its doctrine of inverse condemnation, which holds utilities responsible for wildfire damage linked to their equipment,” per the report. “But Newsom’s advisors said they were confident that a fund coupled with a new safety certification process would stabilize the industry’s finances, ensure that wildfire victims can recoup losses and reduce fire risks.”

— What goes up must come down, as litter: According to the environmental nonprofit group Alliance for the Great Lakers, there were 18,000 balloons or balloon debris, including strings, found along the shorelines of the Great Lakes between 2016 and 2018, the Detroit Free Press reports. “Heightened understanding of problems associated with balloon litter has led five states to limit or ban intentional releases. At least eight others are considering restrictions,” per the report.

OIL CHECK

— Philadelphia refinery fire extinguished: The fire that erupted at a crude oil refinery in Philadelphia on Friday morning was extinguished over the weekend, as an investigation into the cause began. “Officials said the gas valve that had been fueling the blaze has been shut off and the tank involved in the explosion has been isolated,” the Associated Press reports. “Officials say the fire department’s hazmat unit and the public health department are still monitoring air quality. No threat to public health has been reported.”

— A bump in the road for the energy storage boom: Energy storage researchers and advocates are closely monitoring the ongoing investigation over an April fire and explosion of a massive battery in Phoenix. The incident underlined some of the concerns and risks associated with the burgeoning technology that will be key to the growth of renewable energy, the Associated Press reports. “Nearly all of the utility-scale batteries now on the grid or in development are massive versions of the same lithium ion technology that powers cellphones and laptops. If the batteries get too hot, a fire can start and trigger a phenomenon known as thermal runaway, in which the fire feeds on itself and is nearly impossible to stop until it consumes all the available fuel,” per the report. George Crabtree, director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, told the AP the probe is “getting attention, and I think everyone realizes that too many safety incidents . . . will be detrimental going forward.”

State Department need not be at odds with itself on Republic of Cyprus policy,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/450206-state-department-need-not-be-at-odds-with-itself-on,"In 1987, the U.S. Department of State placed the Republic of Cyprus on a list of countries to which sales and transfers of defense articles and services is prohibited under the International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The reason for the prohibition has never been clear. However, it appears to have been imposed in the erroneous belief that it would somehow encourage Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to resolve the nearly 45-year division of the territory of Cyprus.

In December 2018, members of Congress (including this commentary’s co-author) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in which the Department of State was urged to remove Cyprus from the ITAR list. The members asserted Cyprus should never have been placed on the ITAR list because Cyprus does not and never did fall within any of the ITAR categories which warrant the prohibition. They also asserted the State Department has the regulatory authority to remove the Cyprus from the ITAR list without legislation.

In its response to the letter, the State Department stated that a policy of prohibition may apply “whenever an export of defense articles or defense services would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States.” The response also acknowledged Cyprus has “a shared interest in combatting terrorism, enhancing maritime and border security, and promoting regional stability,” and the United States is exploring an enhanced security relationship with Cyprus. In fact, the Department’s letter cites last year’s Statement of Intent between the two countries as an example. The topic has even been raised in bilateral discussions as recently as this month’s meeting between Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Palmer and President of the Republic of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades.

Therefore, the State Department’s response is at odds with itself. Either Cyprus is a threat to peace, stability and U.S. security interests or it is a reliable ally which promotes regional stability and security. It cannot be both.

Since the day Turkey invaded in 1974, it has occupied the territory of Cyprus and excluded the lawful owners from their property.

Most recently, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has explored and drilled in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Cyprus, activities which violate international law. It is these unlawful acts, as well as the occupation, which impede any resumption of settlement negotiations.

However, no progress toward a peaceful and just settlement has occurred since the prohibition was imposed in 1987. The lack of progress is due to Turkish intransigence most recently demonstrated by Turkey’s insistence on antiquated and obstructive stances, such as the Treaty of Guarantee, which would allow for future unilateral Turkish military interventions and is completely unacceptable and contradicts the governing principals of a European Union member state.

The portion of the territory of Cyprus which Turkey occupies should remain on the ITAR list. It is the presence of the 40,000 strong Turkish occupation force which falls into the four categories of the ITAR list.

It is time to lift the arms prohibition on Cyprus. It is as anachronistic as Turkey’s perspective on the Cyprus issue—after all, Nicosia is the last divided European capital. It is in the best interests of the United States for Cyprus to look to the United States, and not any other nation, to procure its defense articles. A provision in the recently introduced Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019 will accomplish this task if the State Department is not willing to do it on its own accord.

Former Art Institute students in Phoenix may get loan relief following Republic report,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Rachel Leingang', 'Published P.M. Mt June']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2019/06/24/u-s-department-education-aid-former-art-institute-students-phoenix/1548210001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Department of Education is stepping in to help former Art Institute of Phoenix students who were denied relief for their college debt.

The department said it is ""re-examining"" the cases of two students who were denied Closed School Discharge and notifying approximately 200 former Art Institute of Phoenix students of their eligibility to the program.

The department's move comes after reporting by The Arizona Republic showed multiple students who attended the Art Institute of Phoenix were denied help from a program that cancels federal student loans if a college closes.

A student loan servicer had told the students they weren't eligible for Closed School Discharge because they attended the campus in Las Vegas, not Phoenix.

One problem: They didn't.

The Phoenix campus closed in December, but the Las Vegas campus is still open. Regardless, that should not affect the Phoenix students' ability to get their loans discharged, according to federal rules.

In a statement on Friday, the department said it was ""re-examining"" the applications for Closed School Discharge for two students.

Brandie Lane and Christine Anderson both told The Republic last week that their student loan servicer, CornerStone, had denied their applications.

The department said it will also be reaching out to the 200 other students who attended the Art Institute of Phoenix.

""In an abundance of caution, we also will notify approximately 200 other students who attended Ai Phoenix that they may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge, and if they have already applied and been denied, they should contact their student loan servicer immediately,"" a department spokesperson said in an email.

Closed School Discharge allows students who attended campuses that shut down to get their student loans deleted if they were enrolled when the school closed or within 120 days of closure. (If they completed their degree before closure, participated in a teach-out or transferred credits to another school, they aren’t eligible for discharge.)

But it's not always straightforward to get loans canceled after a closure, as the situation with the Las Vegas-Phoenix confusion illustrates.

In recent years, Arizona has had several high-profile closures, affecting hundreds of students.

Often, students are left on their own to navigate complex bureaucracies. In this case, students said they could not get answers or assistance from anyone — the loan servicer, the school or the Department of Education.

Why were students denied?

Brandie Lane, a 22-year-old former Art Institute of Phoenix student, has about $40,000 in federal loans. She was on forbearance, a temporary stop to payments, for the Phoenix loans, but was taken off of it. Her account shows a payment of $360 is due July 4.

Christine Anderson, a 46-year-old who was pursuing an interior design degree in Phoenix, has about $30,000 in federal student loans for her time at Art Institute of Phoenix.

Lane and Anderson aren't the only students who were denied because the Las Vegas campus is open.

Thomas Gokey, organizer and co-founder of the Debt Collective, a group of borrowers who have banded together to share information and advocate for each other, said he’s heard from a dozen students with loans held by three different servicers. Many more may be affected, given the number of students who attended the school, he said.

After The Republic article published, several other former Phoenix students reached out, saying they had been denied for the same reason.

Lane and Anderson also heard back from the ombudsman's office at their loan servicer after the story published, though now the company's reason for denying discharge has changed, Gokey said.

The ombudsman's office acknowledged the location error, but now the loan company is denying the discharge because the students could have transferred to another school to complete their programs, letters to the students state.

Students get to decide whether to transfer credits and continue their education, or seek Closed School Discharge if their campus shuts down. They are not required to transfer and continue at another school.

Anderson said she’s frustrated to now be getting denied for an entirely different reason than the Las Vegas campus being open.

“It’s an every day battle, it’s stressful. I think about it when I wake up, I think about it throughout the day. … I feel like I’m being harassed and bullied,” Anderson said.

If there's any solace in the situation, at least now other students are aware of the problem and know they can reapply, she said.

How did this happen?

The confusion over which campus Phoenix students attended relates to an identification number campuses use to access federal funds.

Typically, if the main location of a school closes, like Art Institute of Phoenix did, the other locations associated with it also would lose their eligibility for federal funds, even if they stay open, the department said in an email. The Vegas campus was once considered an additional location of the Phoenix campus.

But the Phoenix-Las Vegas situation is unusual: The Las Vegas campus had become an independent institution and had separate accreditation at the time Phoenix closed.

And the Las Vegas campus kept the school identifier — officially known as the Office of Postsecondary Education Identification number — that the Phoenix campus had in the federal system. Schools get assigned these numbers for the purposes of receiving federal funds.

That meant students' federal loans appeared to be associated with the Las Vegas campus instead of Phoenix because the identification number was the same.

VA employees say agency is actively retaliating against whistleblowers,https://thehill.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449882-va-employees-say-agency-is-actively-retaliating-against-whistleblowers,"Three employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs said in new interviews that they were sidelined at their jobs and stripped of responsibilities after they raised alarms about improper treatment of patients.

In interviews with USA Today the three staffers, physician Katherine Mitchell, CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, and psychologist Minu Aghevli, Ph.D., said that they were removed from patient care positions to prevent them from learning of future or ongoing abuses at the agency.

The three are set to testify before Congress on a wide range of patient mistreatment this week.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" Mitchell told USA Today. ""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans. If people can’t identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. That’s what it boils down to.""

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someone’s health or safety is being threatened,"" she added in the interview.

Dettbarn, who said he hoped to return to patient care, added that a culture of fear at the agency had led to few staffers advocating on behalf of patients.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he told the newspaper. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Sidelining those who speak out, she added, ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

A spokesman for the agency declined to comment to USA Today on the assertions from Mitchell and the others. In a statement to The Hill, an agency spokesperson stressed that the agency was working on implementing new improvements to protect whistleblowers.

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" the spokesperson said.

""VA does not tolerate retaliation against employees who have made a protected disclosure,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Any employee who feels they have been retaliated against for making a protected disclosure is encouraged to contact VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).""

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."

Opinion: Ignore the protests from bureaucrats. More federal agencies would be smart to move their operations away from Washington.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wants to move a few D.C. employees closer to the farmers they regulate. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)

It was a dramatic scene. As Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue spoke to his employees at an all-hands meeting in D.C. last week, several of them stood up and turned their backs to Perdue in silent protest.

I’ve never seen a similar protest at a private company’s staff meeting, although a few of my co-workers were known to silently nod off. Since I had grown accustomed to regular paychecks, I feigned rapt attention while elbowing my sleepy comrades.

What hideous scandal provoked so many loyal public servants to publicly oppose their boss and disrupt America’s beloved agricultural bureaucracy? The $22 trillion national debt? Creeping fascism? The inclusion of kale in Caesar salads?

No, agriculture workers were mad that the secretary is moving a few of them nearer the agriculture they’re regulating.

Work with those you regulate? Eww

“Following a rigorous site selection process, the Kansas City Region provides a win win – maximizing our mission function by putting taxpayer savings into programmatic outputs and providing affordability, easy commutes, and extraordinary living for our employees,” Secretary Perdue said in a press release.

“The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C.”

Want more opinions? Subscribe to azcentral.com.

Don’t get too excited about the money saved, taxpayers. Perdue is only moving 547 employees out of nearly 100,000 employed by the USDA, or about half of 1%.

Still, this minor relocation, utterly common among the private sector, provoked protest and internal demands to unionize the two small sub-agencies affected.

Just imagine, agricultural regulators might be forced to associate with farmers. Eww.

Most agencies should move out of D.C.

This is a tiny step in the right direction, but most of our federal agencies should be moved out of the Beltway. Leave the departments of State, Defense and Treasury in Washington; those are the only three outlined in the Constitution to begin with. If we aren’t going to consolidate or eliminate the other agencies, at least move them closer to their mission.

The Department of the Interior should be, well, in the interior. As an Arizonan, I’m biased, but relocate it to the Grand Canyon State. After all, the federal government already owns nearly 39% of our state. Gila Bend is nice this time of year.

Shouldn’t Housing and Urban Development focus on a city that needs some help? Downtown Detroit is a perfect fit.

The U.S. News and World Report lists Alabama as the worst state for education. Why doesn’t Betsy DeVos move her thousands of employees to Birmingham? Perhaps they could expand their impact by volunteering for a few hours to tutor in local schools.

Maybe they'd serve people better

Six of America’s wealthiest counties surround Washington, D.C. Not only would these moves save taxpayers millions, but they would alleviate income inequality by spreading the government’s borrowed wealth. Why should the perpetual economic boom be limited to our capital?

Better yet, it would help bureaucrats to better serve and understand those whom they are supposedly helping.

If the cabinet secretaries need to commute every few weeks to the White House or Capitol Hill, that’s easy enough to accommodate. Or they could avoid the hassle by video conferencing like the rest of us.

Relocate the Department of Labor to the Rust Belt, the Department of Energy to the oil fields of North Dakota, and the Department of Transportation to the intersection of Interstates 80 and 25 in Cheyenne, Wyo.

And if the president ever needs an energetic Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I’m willing to relocate to any of our fine military bases in Hawaii. I’m not about to turn my back on that move.

The federal officers’ local presence comes on the heels of President Trump’s suspension two days ago of his plan to deport “millions” of undocumented immigrants that was slated to begin Sunday.

Oceana County Sheriff Craig Mast said he received “a very brief update” late Sunday night that there were going to be several vehicles in the area. “I was told they would have several homeland security and ICE officers,” Mast said.

No other information beyond that was shared, he said. “They didn’t specify for how long” the federal officers would be in the area or even if they were conducting immigration raids.

Mast said no detainees have been brought to the Oceana County Jail.

“Detainees don’t come here unless there is a criminal warrant or if they violate Michigan law while coming into contact with a federal officer,” he said.

Several people have been posting photos on Facebook of gray Ford 150 pickup trucks in the Hart and Shelby area that are not marked with ICE or homeland security identification, claiming they are the vehicles being used by the federal officers. Some Facebook posts are claiming that immigration raids have been conducted, but that has not been officially confirmed.

The social media stir has caused the sheriff to receive several calls from community members, he said.

Jon Austria, jaustria@gannett.com; 239-227-7803

An East Naples man served two years in Vietnam and it took nearly 20 years to receive benefits from the government for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Joseph Mattera enlisted in the Marines, leaving from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wanted to go to Vietnam and was a private first class. He finished his two years of service in 1971.

“You realize that the childhood idea of being in combat is very scary,” he said.

Mattera sought aid upon returning home from the Marines as a veteran from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in 1971 for anxiety, which he later discovered was PTSD. Mattera said he took part in ambushes against the enemy.

Doctors handed him a bottle of Valium and sent him on his way, he said.

Decades later, in the early 2000s, the VA provided help for his Agent Orange-related diabetic condition but denied his claim for PTSD.

Mattera did not give up the fight. He hired an attorney, Sean Ravin of Coral Gables, in 2005. That wasn’t enough.

“The VA received his claim and basically denied his claim because they couldn’t confirm his stressor,” Ravin said.

Alexandra Scardino, the Collier County Veterans Services manager, said veterans filing claims for PTSD with the VA need to indicate a “stressor.” For combat-decorated veterans like Purple Heart recipients, additional documentation is not needed.

Otherwise, they may need documentation showing they saw combat or to provide a statement explaining the stressor they experienced while serving.

Ravin said attorneys and advocates like himself file letters of inquiry with the VA and frequently go to court to force the VA into action. But Ravin lost contact with Mattera and later found out Mattera had moved from Boston to East Naples.

“Unfortunately, Joe had sort of drifted off the screen from me,” Ravin said.

Mattera went to the VA again, he said, and explained in more detail what he experienced overseas. A doctor agreed he had PTSD.

The VA closed Mattera’s case without making a decision in 2009, Scardino said.

“Nothing ever happened,” Mattera said.

Mattera started going to Veterans Services in 2017 for help with his disability benefits related to his Agent Orange exposure. When his regular Veteran Services Officer, Irene Johnson, was out for the day, Mattera met with Eddie Hartnack.

Hartnack, who is now retired, was able to identify with a fresh set of eyes and decades of experience that the PTSD claim Mattera filed was closed without a decision.

“Veterans come in for one thing and get another,” Scardino said.

Once Hartnack identified the issue, Veterans Services filed a letter of inquiry, and Mattera received a settlement of $242,000 in April; though 20% will go to Ravin as a contingency fee.

While Scardino said cases like Materra’s are uncommon, Ravin said it is common for cases to take so long.

“I think the fault does lie entirely with the VA, because they’re supposed to move these cases along,” Ravin said. “At least the case has a happy ending.”

The VA could not comment on Mattera's case for privacy concerns. However, Deputy Director of the VA Office of Public Affairs Southeast District Candace Hull said in a statement that as of May 31, the average time between someone filing a disability claim and receiving a letter about the claim was 19½ days.

""VA is currently processing claims, on average, in 103 days. There are currently 76,327 disability claims pending over 125 days in the inventory, down from a peak of 611,000 in March of 2013,"" Hull said in the statement.

Pitfalls lie not just in the process of navigating the VA benefit system, Scardino said, but veterans could hypothetically lose benefits if they file to receive more benefits and the VA decides to reevaluate the veteran.

Mattera was concerned about that, Scardino said, which led to some of his discouragement.

“He just wanted help,” she said.

The decision from the VA meant the world for Mattera.

“It meant that my feelings were real,” he said. “My frustrations I felt my whole life were validated.”

His fiancé, Karen Kolosz, said it was more than the money.

“It was the acknowledgement that the condition existed,” she said.

Both she and Mattera are grateful for the county Veterans Services office for the help they provided, and they — and Scardino — want more veterans to know about the resources available to veterans and their families.

While Scardino said the number of clients the office has seen over the past several years has grown consistently, she still only sees a few thousand of the 30,000 veterans she estimates live in Collier County. For fiscal year October 2016 through September 2017, her office saw about 3,200 clients, she said. The next fiscal year, that increased to about 3,500 clients.

Services provided by Scardino’s office are free, she said, and it typically takes about two business days for veterans to get an appointment with her or the other service officers. Walk-in appointments are taken on Tuesdays and emergency appointments are available for those in dire need.

“I hope Mr. Mattera’s case reaches out to other veterans,” Scardino said.

Mattera spoke highly of the hard work by Ravin and Veterans Services, appreciating that they did not give up in trying to get results from the VA.

“You do need people to roll these people over,” he said.

(Erin Scott/Reuters)

On Monday morning, Florida senator Marco Rubio sent a letter to the Trump administration calling on the United States to render aid to a woman in the United Kingdom who was ordered by a judge to undergo a forced late-term abortion.

“I write with grave concern about the case of a 22-week pregnant Catholic woman with developmental disabilities in the United Kingdom who — against the wishes of her and her Nigerian-origin mother — is being required by a British court to undergo a forced late-term abortion, in what I believe to be a clear human rights violation,” Rubio wrote in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DHS acting secretary Kevin McAleneen. “I urge your Departments to quickly investigate this case and, within all applicable laws and regulations, to offer assistance to her and her mother in seeking alternative medical care either in the United States through a temporary non-immigrant visa or through humanitarian parole for a temporary period due to this urgent humanitarian emergency, or at medical facilities in a third country that will not compel her to undergo a forced late-term abortion.”

On Friday, the Press Association and the Catholic News Agency first reported that an unidentified woman was being ordered by British judge Nathalie Lieven to undergo a forced late-term abortion because the pregnant woman, who is mentally disabled, could suffer from mental distress if the child were put up for adoption.

“’I think [the pregnant woman] would suffer greater trauma from having a baby removed [from her care],’ Lieven said, because ‘it would at that stage be a real baby.’” (Premature infants born at 22 weeks — the age of the child marked for death by Lieven — are capable of surviving outside the womb and living normal lives.) The New York Times reported that “a spokesman for the court confirmed public details of the case by email on Sunday, including the court proceeding and the judge’s comments.”

Update: Jack Crowe and the Wall Street Journal report that the court order has been overturned."
Trump's close brush with Iran: Not the first time a President has pulled back from brink of an attack,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-nixon-presidential-threats/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that the US military had been 10 minutes away from a strike that could have killed 150 Iranians when he pulled the plug on the operation.

Bravo, said anyone nervous about the US launching military attacks on Iran, while wondering how Trump got that close to ordering a strike without realizing it would cost human life.

This is not the first time a US President pulled back from the brink of an attack.

Richard Nixon did it in 1969 after North Koreans shot down an unarmed US spy plane. Nixon was not worried about human life, but politics. According to The New York Times report at the time, he was concerned that Americans wouldn't back the move, which bore some similarities to bombings years earlier in the Gulf of Tonkin that presaged war in Vietnam."
USDA announces feral swine eradication & control pilot program,https://www.kark.com,['Karen Ricketts'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.kark.com/news/local-news/usda-announces-feral-swine-eradication-control-pilot-program/2096764874,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

WASHINGTON, – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)announced today it is offering $75 million in funding for the eradication and control of feral swine through the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program (FSCP) in a joint effort between USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

The 2018 Farm Bill included this new pilot program to help address the threat that feral swine pose to agriculture, ecosystems and human and animal health.

NRCS will direct up to $33.75 million of the allocated FSCP funds toward partnership efforts to work with landowners in identified pilot projects in targeted areas. Applications are being accepted through Aug. 19, 2019, for partners to carry out activities as part of these pilot projects in select areas of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. APHIS has determined that these states have among the highest feral swine population densities and associated damages in the country.

“NRCS state conservationists and APHIS state directors, in coordination with state technical committees, have identified pilot projects that can be carried out within these target states,” NRCS Chief Matthew Lohr said. “Our agencies stand ready to work with partners at the state and local level to respond to the threat of feral swine.”

Pilot projects will consist broadly of three coordinated components: 1) feral swine removal by APHIS; 2) restoration efforts supported by NRCS; and 3) assistance to producers for feral swine control provided through partnership agreements with non-federal partners. Projects can be one to three years in duration.

“The projects selected for funding will allow APHIS and NRCS to collectively reduce the damage and disease caused by one of the most destructive and formidable invasive species in the United States,” said APHIS Administrator Kevin Shea. “Overall, this pilot program builds upon and expands work already underway by APHIS’ National Feral Swine Damage Management Program to both manage feral swine and eliminate populations in partnership with local government, the private sector, industry and academia.”

NRCS is now accepting proposals from non-federal partners to provide landowner assistance for on-farm trapping and related services as part of the pilot projects described above. NRCS will provide funding for these services through partnership agreements. The funding limit for a single award is $1.5 million. Awardees will be required to provide at least 25 percent of the partnership agreement budget as a match to NRCS funding.

Additional information on the complete funding announcement and about specific pilot projects, including target areas and the roles for which partner assistance is being requested, can be found on the FSCP webpage.

Applications must be submitted through grants.gov by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Aug. 19, 2019."
The Cuyahoga River caught fire 50 years ago. These stomach-churning photos highlight why the EPA exists.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-photos-of-cuyahoga-river-on-fire-before-epa-2019-6,"Fifty years ago, on June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire.

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

Take a look at what the Cuyahoga River — and other waters around the US — looked like before the EPA existed."
