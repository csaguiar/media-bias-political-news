"Trump rips into British left-wing critics Khan, Corbyn in press conference",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-holds-press-conference-with-uk-pm-theresa-may-tells-her-to-stick-around-for-trade-deal,"President Trump on Tuesday, in a press conference with outgoing U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, blasted his British left-wing critics as a ""negative force"" -- and confirmed that he snubbed the leader of the opposition Labour Party when he sought a sit-down.

""I don't know Jeremy Corbyn, never met him, never spoke to him -- he wanted to meet today or tomorrow and I decided I would not do that,"" Trump told reporters at the London press conference.

TRUMP BABY BLIMP FLIES IN LONDON AS PROTESTS GREET PRESIDENT

""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done,"" he said.

Corbyn, the Labour Party leader and a veteran left-wing activist, was attending an anti-Trump protest as the press conference was ongoing. During that, he said he was ""not, absolutely not, refusing to meet anybody.""

""I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about the better and more peaceful world we all want to live in,"" he said.

Trump also took another shot at longtime foe and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who had also opposed Trump's visit to Britain.

""I don't think he should be criticizing a representative of the United States that can do so much good for the United Kingdom,"" Trump said. ""He's a negative force, not a positive force.""

Of the mayor, Trump said: ""He's done a poor job, crime is up, a lot of problems.""

May was similarly critical of the left-wing detractors. While noting differences with the Americans on issues such as Iran and the Paris climate deal, she highlighted the importance of the special relationship between the two countries to British citizens at home and abroad and to the British economy as a whole.

""That is a relationship that we should cherish, it is a relationship we should build on and should be proud of,"" she said.

""This really is a very big and important alliance and I think people should act positively toward it because it means so much for both countries,"" Trump agreed.

TRUMP SUPPORTERS BARRICADED IN LONDON PUB BY POLICE AFTER BEING SURROUNDED BY PROTESTERS

The press conference comes amid a three-day state visit for Trump, which has included a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner at Buckingham Palace. He will mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Portsmouth, before traveling to France to take part in celebrations there.

But while the visit has included a fair amount of pomp and circumstance, it has not stopped Trump from bringing his own brand of bare-knuckle politics to Blighty -- with him calling Khan a “stone cold loser” on Monday.

“Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, [Bill] de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job -- only half his height,” he said.

His remarks were apparently in response to an op-ed by Khan, in which the mayor called Trump ""one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat.""

""That’s why it’s so un-British to be rolling out the red carpet this week for a formal state visit for a president whose divisive behaviour flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon -- equality, liberty and religious freedom,"" he wrote.

Trump has also brushed aside diplomatic norms in weighing in on the race to succeed May as prime minister. May will step down from Number 10 on Friday and a leadership contest will begin days later.

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON BACKING BORIS JOHNSON AS NEXT UK PM

Britain was due to leave the bloc in March, but that has been delayed until Oct. 31 after Parliament rejected three times the withdrawal agreement May thrashed out with European leaders last year. Trump has thrown most of his backing behind former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a hardline Brexiteer born in New York who has warmed to Trump in recent years.

Trump said Tuesday that he's liked Johnson ""for a long time"" and also said that Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt would be a strong candidate.

""I know Boris, I like him, I've liked him for a long time. I think he'd do a very good job I know Jeremy, I think he'd do a very good job,"" he said.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Johnson turned down a one-on-one meeting with the president because it clashed with a leadership debate, but that the two will speak by phone.

Beyond the race to succeed May, Trump has also given his support to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whom he praised for finishing first in the recent European Parliament elections.

“Nigel’s had a big victory, he picked up 32 percent of the vote starting from nothing, and I think they’re big powers over there -- I think they’ve done a good job,” Trump said last week.

The American president’s visit comes at a critical time for the U.K. Should Brexit go ahead, a U.S.-U.K. trade relationship will be key to Britain’s post-Brexit success. Trump used the press conference to double down on his support for a deal.

“There is tremendous potential in that trade deal, I would probably say two or three times what we are doing now,” he said.

While he has been critical of May's handling of Brexit in the past, on Tuesday he was more diplomatic: ""Perhaps you won't be given the credit you deserve...you deserve a lot of credit."" But he also joked with May about past advice that he gave her to sue to E.U. instead of negotiating with the European behemoth.

""I would have sued but that's OK. I would have sued and settled maybe, but you never know, she's probably a better negotiator than I am,"" he said.

But Trump will also face a significant protest in the capital on Tuesday, where left-wing activists and politicians are due to march in protest of the visit -- similar to a large protest that took place during Trump’s working visit to the country last year.

Trump said he had only seen a ""small protest"" and said he had instead seen a lot of support from Brits: ""It was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons."""

New Mexico is one of the states his 2020 campaign is looking at. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 2020 elections Trump tries to upend the 2020 map The president's reelection campaign is making moves to expand his reelection path beyond three treacherous Rust Belt states.

President Donald Trump is targeting a trio of states that he lost in 2016 — a move aimed at widening his path to reelection that comes as he’s struggling in the Rust Belt states that propelled him to the White House.

Trump officials are zeroing in on New Mexico, Nevada and New Hampshire, where they insist there’s an opening despite heavy losses Republicans suffered there in the midterms. They’ve deployed around a half-dozen staffers to New Hampshire and several to Nevada, an unusually early investment in places that favor Democrats. And the campaign is doing polling to tease out Trump’s level of support in New Mexico, a focal point for campaign manager Brad Parscale, and they have discussed dispatching aides to the blue state.

Story Continued Below

The maneuvering underscores how Trump is trying to capitalize on his vast financial and organizational advantage over Democrats. Yet it also illustrates how the president, whose own polling shows him falling behind in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, is seeking out additional routes to a second term.

In conversations on Air Force One and in the White House, Parscale has told Trump it’s imperative that he compete aggressively in states he lost in 2016.

“Every candidate for president needs multiple paths to 270 electoral votes. Last time, they had one path and it worked. But since no one can run the table every time, better to have multiple paths to 270,” said Republican strategist Karl Rove, who, as the architect of George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection, oversaw a successful effort to win several states Republicans lost four years earlier.

“Even in a reelection, you cannot count on repeating what you did before,” Rove added. “Sometimes, the nature of the opposing candidate changes the playing field, opening possibilities and closing others.”

Still, there’s considerable skepticism that Trump can make a serious play in the states — especially Nevada and New Mexico. Republicans have not won a presidential race in Nevada or New Mexico since 2004, and the last time they carried New Hampshire was in 2000. Democrats won every statewide race in New Mexico last year; in Nevada, they seized a Senate seat as well as the governorship. In New Hampshire, Democrats won control of both state legislative chambers.

Trump’s unpopularity was a big factor in that success, Democrats say.

“Last cycle, Democrats crushed Republicans in these states by highlighting President Trump’s toxic health care agenda and broken promises — that’s why he’ll lose them again in 2020,” said David Bergstein, a Democratic National Committee spokesman. “While we take nothing for granted, this GOP strategy looks like they are already concerned about a realistic pathway to 270 electoral votes.”

Trump aides acknowledge they start at a disadvantage in each of the three states, which total 15 electoral votes. (By comparison, Pennsylvania has 20 electoral votes, Michigan has 16 and Wisconsin 10.) But there are good reasons for the early investments, they say: Trump lost Nevada and New Hampshire narrowly in 2016, and all three states are small and relatively easy to organize in.

In Nevada and New Mexico, Trump officials say they’re buoyed by internal polling showing rising Latino support compared with 2016 — results they attributed to Hispanics who agree with the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration, among other factors.

“Hispanics are coming up saying, ‘I’m supporting the president.’ And that’s something I didn’t get three years ago. It was a pretty hard line in the sand,” said Steve Pearce, the New Mexico GOP chairman and a former congressman. “If he hits 35 percent, 38 percent, 40 percent of the Hispanic population, he’ll win New Mexico.”

Pearce recalled chatting with Trump about New Mexico during a holiday party at the White House last year and said it was apparent the president “well understood the value of our five [electoral] votes.”

The campaign’s interest in New Mexico partly stems from a February rally the president held just across the state line in El Paso, Texas. Aides discovered that about 70 percent of those who registered online to attend were Hispanic, and many came from nearby southern New Mexico.

Others in Trump’s political orbit are also paying attention to the state. Last week, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, the father of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, penned a column in which he suggested that backlash to the policies of newly elected Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham could create an opening for Republicans.

“I feel sorry for the people of New Mexico, but I hope they’ve learned their lesson,” Huckabee wrote. “Maybe the next time they go to the polls, they won’t say, ‘Thank you, sir, may I have another?’ and fill in the ‘D’ circles again.”

Nevada Republicans, meanwhile, have been struck by the campaign’s decision to orchestrate an early field deployment. Additional staffers are expected to come aboard this month.

“It’s a winnable state, and they believe it’s winnable or they wouldn’t be on the ground. To my recollection, we’ve never started a presidential this far out,” said former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Trump backer from a prominent Nevada political family. “They usually parachute in the election year, spring-ish,” added Laxalt, who, like Pearce, ran unsuccessfully for governor last year.

The Trump campaign’s optimism in New Hampshire is rooted in the belief that the party’s infrastructure will be fully behind the president. In 2016, Trump campaigned without the support of then-GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, while the state GOP chairwoman at the time, Jennifer Horn, criticized Trump for running a “shallow” campaign.

Since then, pro-Trump forces have mounted a takeover of the state party. Stephen Stepanek, a former state legislator and a longtime Trump supporter, took over as chairman earlier this year.

“We did not have a united party behind Donald Trump, our nominee, in ’16,” said Stepanek. “And that will not be the case in 2020.”

Trump aides say they’re monitoring other states he lost in 2016, including Minnesota and Colorado. Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, has launched an aggressive effort to make inroads in Virginia, where statewide Democratic officeholders have suffered an array of scandals. Pence has visited Virginia a handful of times since late March, and on Thursday he is slated to appear at a D-Day memorial event in conservative Bedford County.

Trump campaign officials downplayed any concerns about the Rust Belt, saying the campaign is confident the president will prevail there again. But Scott Jennings, a former George W. Bush White House political aide, pointed to another incentive to compete in blue states: forcing Democrats to play defense.

“I think the Trump campaign is smart to try to open some new Electoral College avenues, even if you believe the probability of winning a map-stretcher is low,” Jennings said. “The race will be close and you need to work every possible angle.”

Judge rejects House Democrats' request to block Trump's border wall funding,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-rejects-house-democrats-request-to-block-trumps-border-wall-funding/,"A federal judge on Monday denied a House request to prevent President Donald Trump from tapping Defense Department money for his proposed border wall with Mexico, saying Congress lacked authority to sue.

Trump's victory is muted by a federal ruling in California last month that blocked construction of key sections of the wall. The California case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, wrote that the House's lawsuit was ""about whether one chamber of Congress has the 'constitutional means' to conscript the Judiciary in a political turf war with the President over the implementation of legislation.""

McFadden said Congress didn't have authority in this case but that he didn't mean to imply the legislative body could never challenge the president in court over separation of powers.

""An old maxim in politics holds that, 'Where you stand depends on where you sit,'"" he wrote. ""At law too, whether a plaintiff has standing often depends on where he sits. A seat in Congress comes with many prerogatives, but legal standing to superintend the execution of laws is not among them.""

The Justice Department welcomed the decision, saying the judge ""rightly ruled that the House of Representatives cannot ask the judiciary to take its side in political disputes and cannot use federal courts to accomplish through litigation what it cannot achieve using the tools the Constitution gives to Congress.""

A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats were reviewing the ruling and evaluating whether to appeal.

A federal judge in Oakland, California, ruled May 24 that Trump overstepped his authority and blocked work from beginning on two of the highest-priority, Pentagon-funded wall projects — one spanning 46 miles in New Mexico and another covering 5 miles (8 kilometers) in Yuma, Arizona. The administration plans to appeal the ruling by Haywood Gilliam Jr., an appointee of President Barack Obama.

At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress on a signature campaign promise heading into his bid for a second term. The administration faces several lawsuits over the emergency declaration but only two sought to block construction during the legal challenge.

Trump declared a national emergency in February after losing a fight with the Democratic-led House that led to a 35-day government shutdown and identified up to $8.1 billion for wall construction. The funds include $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund.

The Defense Department has already transferred the counterdrug money. Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is expected to decide any day whether to transfer the military construction funds."
Trump’s Two Crutches,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Elaina Plott'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/trump-tariffs-mexico/590950/,"Read: Impeachment is the song of the summer

In other words, as my colleague Peter Nicholas explained last week, Mueller’s remarks further inflamed Trump’s anger toward the special counsel. So while his tariff announcement was in many ways a surprise, it also had a tinge of inevitability. According to current and former aides, who requested anonymity to speak freely, when Trump feels he has lost control of the narrative, he grasps at two issues: border security and trade. Those aides said he sees these topics as reset buttons, ways to rile both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and draw attention away from whatever dumpster fire is blazing in a given week. “Whenever a negative story comes around, his instinct is to pivot to immigration or trade,” a senior campaign adviser told me. “It’s kind of like his safety blanket. He knows that Fox and conservative media will immediately coalesce and change what the base is talking about.”

That tactic often works: By the end of a week in which the lies of the White House’s representation of the Mueller report became more apparent than ever, reporters, pundits, and the stock market were all responding instead to Trump’s latest attempt to curb immigration at the southern border. (The Dow Jones closed Friday at four-month lows in response to the tariffs.)

One former senior White House official explained Trump’s instincts as a function of his intractable belief that the American people support his policies on immigration and trade, even if party leaders do not. As the source put it to me, the president thrives on the warm reception he receives at rallies and believes that those policies fuel it. The former official pointed to another time when Trump surprised his advisers by levying tariffs: In March 2018, in off-the-cuff remarks during a meeting with steel and aluminum executives, Trump announced the beginning of a global trade war by promising a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports. In this case, the former official said, Trump’s snap decision was not so much a way to distract from a particular news cycle as it was the result of “feeling good in the moment” as he bantered cheerfully with the executives. Put another way, dramatic moves on trade and immigration are not only a balm for Trump in times of distress, but also a gloss on moments already going smoothly.

That Trump reverted to tariffs on Thursday offers a clue as to just how distressing the past week has been for him. Trump is no stranger to bad weeks, of course. But according to the senior campaign adviser, he was particularly unnerved by the media attention Mueller’s statement received. “Mueller controlled the news cycle,” this person said. “It was 24/7 the last couple of days. And that’s what bothers him.” Added to that was the increasing number of 2020 candidates calling to begin impeachment proceedings against the president, a topic most have been loath to touch on the campaign trail. For any public bluster from the White House welcoming an impeachment fight, Trump has zero private desire to take one on, according to a second senior campaign official. “To be impeached?!? No one wants that,” the source told me in a text message."

The Justice Department is pressing a federal appeals court for an emergency stay that would allow President Donald Trump to move forward with construction of two key stretches of border wall in Arizona and Texas.

In a filing late Monday night California time, Justice Department attorneys said the preliminary injunction issued last month by a federal judge in Oakland threatens to derail the construction by delaying the projects past the end of the fiscal year in September.

“The injunction threatens to permanently deprive [the Department of Defense] of its authorization to use the funds at issue to complete the El Paso and Yuma projects, because the funding will likely lapse during the appeal’s pendency,” Justice Department lawyers said in the motion filed with the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam granted the injunction on May 24, saying that the administration’s immediate plan to tap $1 billion in counterdrug funding for the border wall amounted to an unauthorized expenditure of government funds because it was not tied to an unforeseen emergency.

Gilliam said Congress already considered the administration’s requests for border barrier construction and appropriated about $1.4 billion this year — far short of the $8.1 billion Trump is attempting to spend on the projects by tapping various sources of funding.

Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border to unlock some of that funding, but the money transfer blocked by the judge last month did not stem from that move.

The Justice Department stay motion appears to mock the concerns raised by the plaintiffs who obtained the court order, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition — that wall construction could interfere with other uses they make of lands along the border.

“The court seriously mis-weighed the balance of harms. Plaintiffs’ interests in hiking, birdwatching, and fishing — in two drug-smuggling corridors with deteriorating existing barriers — do not come close to outweighing the harm from interfering with efforts to stop the flow of drugs entering the country,” attorneys wrote.

The new motion appears to urge the appeals court to rule by June 17, saying that a ruling by that date “would allow the parties time to seek emergency relief, if necessary, from the Supreme Court.”

Justice Department lawyers said that if the contracting process isn’t fully green-lighted by late June, it may not be completed by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

Earlier Monday, a Washington-based federal judge handling a lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives turned down that body’s request for a preliminary injunction. The House’s arguments are similar to those in the other suit, but the judge said the legislators have a variety of options to affect the administration’s actions, such as cutting off future funding."

The Queen rolled out the red carpet for the President at Buckingham Palace at the start of his three-day state visit.

But a grumpy looking Harry, 34, kept as far away as possible.

Meghan had backed Trump’s Democrat rival Hilary Clinton during the 2016 election, and said she would move to Canada if he won.

In an exclusive interview with the Sun before his visit, President Trump learned of the comments and said he didn’t know “she was nasty” — but that she would be a “very good” princess.

He and wife Melania landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 8:56 a.m. following an overnight flight on Air Force One from Washington DC.

They later boarded their Marine One helicopter and were flown to central London — landing on the Palace lawn at 12:12 pm.

Harry attended the private lunch with Donald and First Lady Melania, but on a tour of Her Majesty’s private art collection hung back and did not want to be photographed with any of the party.

He walked in with the President’s daughter Ivanka but left her to talk to the Lord Chamberlain while the Queen showed the Trumps around with Prince Charles close behind.

An onlooker said: “Harry was the third most senior royal in the room after the Queen and his father, but didn’t seem to take any part in his royal duties.”

Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said: “Harry did look grumpy and as if he didn’t want to be there.

“He appears to be behaving in a rather immature way and letting his personal animosity take over from his natural good manners.

"White House instructs Hope Hicks, former McGahn aide not to comply with congressional subpoenas",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Rachael Bade', 'Congressional Reporter', 'June At Am']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-instructs-hope-hicks-former-mcgahn-aide-not-to-comply-with-congressional-subpoenas/2019/06/04/3bad7c44-8626-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html,"President Trump reacts as he stands next to former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks outside of the Oval Office as he departs the White House for a trip to Cleveland last year. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)

The White House instructed former president Trump aide Hope Hicks and the ex-counsel's chief of staff not to cooperate with a congressional subpoena for documents related to their White House service.

The House Judiciary Committee last month issued a compulsory measure to one of Trump’s closest staffers and longtime aides, Hicks, and Donald McGahn’s staffer, Annie Donaldson, as part of its expansive probe into potential abuse of power, public corruption and obstruction.

Both faced a Tuesday deadline to turn over documents and have been subpoenaed to appear for testimony later in June.

In a statement, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the committee, said the two were told not to cooperate.

“As part of President Trump’s continued obstruction of Congress, the White House has instructed both Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to turn over records in response to subpoenas issued by our committee last month,” Nadler said. “I note that Ms. Hicks has agreed to turn over some documents to the committee related to her time working for the Trump campaign, and I thank her for that show of good faith.”

Nadler said federal law says the documents that left the White House months ago are no longer covered by executive privilege “if they ever were.”

“The president has no lawful basis for preventing these witnesses from complying with our request,” Nadler said. “We will continue to seek reasonable accommodation on these and all our discovery requests and intend to press these issues when we obtain the testimony of both Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.”

The standoff is just the latest in the escalating war between the House and the Trump administration. The lower chamber is set to vote next week on a massive contempt citation for Attorney General William P. Barr and McGahn for refusing to comply with subpoenas as well. The matter will then move to civil court, where Democrats hope they can convince a judge to force both men to comply with Hill probes.

The party is likely to do the same with Hicks and Donaldson should they follow the White House request and refuse to answer questions and turn over documents.

The dust-up comes as frustrated Judiciary Committee Democrats have begun calling for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open an impeachment inquiry they believe will hasten judicial rulings in their favor. Investigators have been stuck, unable to advance their probes because of an uncooperative White House.

The Judiciary committee is particularly interested in Donaldson, who took detailed notes of McGahn’s exchanges with the president. McGahn was a central witness in some of the 10 instances of potential obstruction identified by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III in his report.

The panel also believes Hicks, a longtime close confidant of Trump, probably knows details on several topics they are investigating.

McGahn also faced a deadline to hand over all communications pertaining to the Mueller probe, but the White House told McGahn it would invoke executive privilege over the material. McGahn ultimately refused to turn over anything.

Donaldson appears as a critical contemporaneous narrator of some of the most worrisome and tempestuous moments inside the West Wing. She took notes directly from McGahn as he left discussions with Trump, documenting how he railed against and sought to control a criminal investigation that he felt imperiled his presidency.

Donaldson is a sought-after witness because she can bring events in the White House to life, explaining what she and McGahn were feeling or fearing when Trump took some actions. Democrats would seek her reactions to some of these moments, including when Trump announced to staff he would fire FBI director James B. Comey, and when he ordered McGahn to try to intervene and have Mueller removed for alleged conflicts of interest.

Donaldson’s daily habit of documenting conversations and meetings provided the special counsel’s office with its version of the Nixon White House tapes: a running account of the president’s actions, albeit in sentence fragments and concise descriptions.

Donaldson famously fretted in her West Wing diary “is this the beginning of the end?” when Trump insisted on firing Comey in May 2017 and on mentioning the president was not a subject of the Russia investigation in his public termination letter. She and McGahn both believed his mention of the Russia probe could be viewed as evidence he was engaged in obstruction of justice. She also described McGahn’s repeated efforts to try to protect Trump from his worst impulses and the case he was building against himself in various ways. That included when he sought to call the Justice Department himself and tried to improperly pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “unrecuse” and resume control over the investigation.

Donaldson, 37, is married to a former Justice Department lawyer, and the couple has returned to Alabama. She is described by friends as proud of her work helping to implement a conservative agenda, but somewhat stung by her experience in Washington.

The panel has sought to talk to Hicks as well. In an early March letter, they asked her to turn over communications she has had related to dozens of topics: They wanted any information about former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s move to lie to the FBI about his contacts with Russian official Sergey Kislyak as well as his resignation. They have asked for any information she has on Trump’s contact with Comey, particularly his firing.

They also asked her about hush payments to women alleging affairs with the president during the 2016 election and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and Russians who offered dirt on Hillary Clinton. Hicks was reportedly involved in crafting a July 8, 2017 statement about that meeting that was later found inaccurate.

A Federal Judge in Washington, D.C. dismissed a lawsuit against Trump ""national emergency"" to fund the border wall, but his ruling did not reach the merits of the lawsuit's claim.

Doug Mataconis · · 1 comment

A Federal District Court Judge in Washington, D.C. blocked a lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives against the President’s efforts to use his authority to declare a “national emergency” to bypass Congress and provide funding to his border wall on the southern border with Mexico:0

WASHINGTON — President Trump ended a losing streak in court clashes with the House on Monday, as a federal judge rejected the Democrat-controlled chamber’s lawsuit seeking to stop him from using emergency powers to build a wall along the southwestern border.

Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, ruled that the House could not show that it had suffered the sort of injury that gave it standing to sue.

The ruling will not have any immediate practical consequences because other groups have already secured an order blocking Mr. Trump from proceeding. But if other courts accept Judge McFadden’s reasoning, the House’s litigation options will narrow as it battles the president on several fronts.

Rulings from trial judges do not set binding precedents, however, and Judge McFadden’s ruling did not concern subpoenas issued by the House seeking information from the administration. He said a different legal analysis applied to disputes arising from such subpoenas. Judge McFadden said courts should generally resolve disputes between the other two branches only as a last resort. Here, he wrote, “Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,” including legislation “to expressly restrict the transfer or spending of funds for a border wall.”

Moreover, Judge McFadden wrote, “as it has recently shown, the House is more than capable of investigating conduct by the executive.” The House can also file briefs in lawsuits brought by private parties, he added, noting that it did so in the California cases.

“These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House,” Judge McFadden wrote.

More from The Washington Post:

A federal judge in Washington on Monday rejected a House lawsuit to block spending on President Trump’s plan to build a wall at the border with Mexico.

U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied a House request to temporarily stop spending on the wall, saying the House lacked legal standing to sue the president for allegedly overstepping his power by diverting billions intended for other purposes to pay for it.

“While the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress’s legislative authority,” McFadden, a 2017 Trump appointee, wrote in a 24-page decision. “The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the House’s claims and will deny its motion.”

The decision is at odds with a May 24 ruling by a federal judge in California that temporarily blocked part of the plan because it was using money Congress never appropriated for that purpose. A central issue for both courts is whether diverting the funds is an illegal act that violates the constitutional separation of powers between branches of the government. Both challenges were brought shortly after the president declared a national emergency along the southern border, but the plaintiffs in California included border communities and environmental groups.

The judge in Washington never touched on the merits of the Democratic-led House’s claim, ruling instead that a single chamber of Congress had “several political arrows in its quiver” remaining to address disputes with a president and could not show that it needed courts to intervene as “a last resort.” McFadden granted that the case “presents a close question” and added that his ruling “does not imply that [the full] Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers.” Still, he said, the Constitution provides the House other levers to use against the executive, including specifically denying funds, passing other legislation, conducting hearings and investigations, or overriding a president’s veto. McFadden’s order effectively kills the House suit, which sought to block the administration from tapping not only $1 billion already transferred from military pay and pension accounts, but also money from an emergency military construction fund that the administration said it intends to transfer but has not yet moved.

A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Democrats were reviewing the ruling and evaluating whether to appeal.

The Justice Department issued a statement through a spokesman: “The Court rightly ruled that the House of Representatives cannot ask the judiciary to take its side in political disputes and cannot use federal courts to accomplish through litigation what it cannot achieve using the tools the Constitution gives to Congress.”

This case originated, of course, with the “national emergency” that President Trump declared in late February at the same time that he signed off on a final budget deal reached by the House and Senate. That budget, of course, did not include significant funding for the President’s border wall, something that had been the main issue of contention during the thirty-five-day government shutdown that lasted from December 22nd to January 25th. In response to the failure of Congress to provide this funding, the President purported to utilize the authority granted to him under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which gives the President the authority to declare a “national emergency” that at least in theory includes the authority to divert funding from one part of the Executive Branch to another to address the purported emergency. This authority has been used by Presidents in a variety of ways in the past but never in the manner that Trump used it to provide funding to a project that had been specifically denied by Congress. Indeed, the President seemed to undermine his own case for a “national emergency” at the news conference where he announced it when he admitted that he “did not need to do this.” Specifically, the President admitted that he could have waited for additional funding from Congress but that he wanted to speed the project along. This admission is an obviously damaging admission on the part of the President because it suggests that there is no “national emergency” and that Trump was merely using the alleged authority the law provides to him to get around the political process that the Constitution contemplates.

In response, a number of organizations and entities filed lawsuits against the President in an effort to block his declaration and put a hold on border wall spending and construction. These include suits filed by California and fifteen other states that allege that they would be adversely impacted by the Administration’s action. Another has been filed by the watchdog group Public Citizen on behalf of Texas landowners and an environmental group in Texas. Another lawsuit was brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders and Wildlife, and the Animal Defense Fund. Others have been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union,

El Paso County, Texas, and the Border Network for Human Rights. Finally, of course, there was the lawsuit filed by the House of Representatives asserting that the President’s efforts to use his emergency powers

In addition to these rulings, Congress also sought to block the President’s declaration of a “national emergency” through the procedures allowed by the 1976 law. Within days after the President had made his declaration, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives began considering a resolution designed to halt that declaration. That resolution was approved by the House and Senate but vetoed by the President, and Congress unsurprisingly failed to override that veto. Despite that veto, though, it was notable that at least in the Senate the vote against the President’s declaration was bipartisan in some sense, with six Republicans joining in with the Democrats in favor of the resolution. Unfortunately, the number of Republicans in the House who did the same was relatively small.

It’s important to note that this was not a decision on the merits and the Judge’s opinion does not address any of the legal questions raised by the House in its lawsuit or by any of the Plaintiffs in the other cases in this lawsuit. In this respect, it is similar to the fate suffered by the lawsuit filed by California and fifteen other states. In both cases, the Courts ruled that the Plaintiffs lacked legal standing to bring a lawsuit against the President over this issue. In the state lawsuit, the Court ruled that the states had failed to establish the kind of damages necessary to establish standing in a Federal Court. In this lawsuit, Judge Trevor McFadden, who was appointed by President Trump in 2017, the Court ruled that one chamber of Congress lacked a legal basis to file suit against the President under the facts alleged. In so doing, the Court noted that Congress had other means, such as oversight powers, the “power of the purse,” and the power to put forward legislation to limit Presidential authority to push back against the Executive Branch in situations such as this.

Standing is not among the ‘sexier’ areas of the law in Federal Courts, but it has often been a way that lawsuits that seemingly have merit have been cut off at the knees, In a long series of cases that go back decades, the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts have held that in order to have standing to maintain a lawsuit in Federal Court, a Complaint must meet three criteria:

First, the Plaintiff must have suffered a “concrete” and “particularized” “injury in fact.” Generally speaking, this means that the Plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that they have suffered something more than a generalized “injury” that impacts them uniquely from the public as a whole;

Second, the Plaintiff must show a causal link between the injury and the alleged illegal conduct by the Defendant; and

Third, the Plaintiff must show that the injury can be redressed by a ruling from the Court.

In both this case and in the lawsuit filed by California and its sister states, the respective district judges found that the Plaintiffs had failed to meet the first criteria in that they failed to show that they had suffered some unique injury by virtue of the President’s action.

Ilya Somin has a post up at The Volokh Conspiracy on this decision, noting that it does seem to conflict with a decision from a difference Judge on the D.C. District Court:

The House claimed that Trump’s illegal divergence of federal funds to the border wall inflicts an “institutional injury” on Congress by undermining its control over federal spending through the power of the purse. Judge McFadden concludes that “an alleged injury to the Appropriations power” is not enough to confer standing. Otherwise, Congress could bring lawsuits in a wide range of cases where presidents spend money in ways congressional leaders claim were not properly authorized. Moreover, he contends that judicial resolution of disputes between the different branches of government should be a “last resort. (…) It is true that the House has other potential tools to use in its conflict with the president. But they all involve passing additional legislation, which is subject to presidential veto. Part of the point of giving Congress control over spending is that the burden of inertia supports them. If they choose not to allocate money for purposes the White House wants, that decision cannot be reversed unless and until they change their minds. Congress can protect its power simply by doing nothing. By contrast, once the president uses funds for unauthorized purposes, Congress cannot prevent it other than by passing new legislation—legislation that the president has enormous leverage over.



I am also skeptical about Judge McFadden’s attempt to distinguish this case from his own court’s 2015 ruling in House of Representatives v. Burwell, where the court ruled that the then-GOP controlled House had standing to sue the Obama administration for illegally spending federal funds on Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. Judge McFadden claims that Burwell is too much of a “slender reed” to justify granting the House standing in this case. But the two seem very similar to me. Burwell claimed that standing is permissible in cases that involved “constitutional” violation (the money in question had never been appropriated at all), as opposed to a statutory violation (the statutes at issue do not authorize the spending in question). But, as McFadden himself recognizes the distinction between statutory and constitutional issues here is far from clear. If the wall spending is not authorized by any statute, then Trump’s diversion of the money violates the Constitution by infringing on Congress’ power of the purse.

Because Burwell was a district court decision, it is not a binding precedent that future courts must follow (the same goes for Judge McFadden’s ruling). But if Burwell was correctly decided (as I believe it was), than Judge McFadden is wrong.

While the media coverage of this ruling is framing this as a victory for the Trump Administration, it’s important to note that it is, at best, a limited one. As noted, Judge McFadden did not rule on the merits of the lawsuit and essentially expressed no opinion on whether or not the President’s exercise of emergency powers in this situation was proper, or whether the diversion of funds from purposes specified by Congress was permissible. As a result, its actual impact and importance is relatively limited.

Additionally, it should be noted that the outcome in this case has no impact on the ruling handed down late last month by a Federal Judge in California in cases brought by a number of private organizations and individual Plaintiffs. In that case, the Judge found that the Plaintiffs did pass the standing test and ultimately handed down a ruling that found that the President had overstepped his Constitutional and statutory authority in diverting funds to border wall construction. As a result, the Judge in that case, who had also ruled against California and her sister states in their lawsuit, placed an injunction on border wall funding that remains in place.

The next step for the House of Representatives, of course, would be to appeal this matter to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Potentially, that court could rule that Judge McFadden erred in his ruling that the House lacked standing to bring the lawsuit and that the case should be allowed to proceed to the merits of the claim. At the moment, though, there is no indication whether that appeal will be taken, though. So, for now, the Trump Administration has won this one but it essentially happened for reasons that don’t really go to the questions presented by the case.

Here’s the opinion:

Attkisson: 10 Questions I'd Ask Robert Mueller (If I Were Allowed),https://www.zerohedge.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-06-04/attkisson-10-questions-id-ask-robert-mueller-if-i-were-allowed,"Authored by Sharyl Attkisson, op-ed via The Hill,

Most of now-former special counsel Robert Mueller’s public statement to the press last week seemed to fall under the category of “Fair enough.” After all, the man did nearly two years of work, he kept largely silent throughout, and he alternately was called a hero or a dog.

So the day Mueller resigns, he chooses to make a fairly brief statementputting a button on all of it, and at the same time declining to take any questions, before gliding back into private life.

But there’s at least one comment Mueller made that nags at me. It’s when he said, “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”

Mueller must have had his reasons for shading his commentary in that way rather than in the other direction: If they’d found adequate evidence to implicate Trump in a crime, or even “collusion,” they would have said that, too.

The statement Mueller chose to give carries with it an implication that his team looked for evidence of President Trump’s innocence but simply could not find it. With that in mind, I thought of a short list of questions I’d like to ask Mueller, if ever permitted to do so:

What witnesses did you interview and what evidence did you collect in an attempt to exonerate Trump or prove him not guilty? (I believe the answer would be, “None. It’s not the job of a special counsel or prosecutor to do so.” Therefore, was Mueller’s comment appropriate?) Does it concern you that the FBI claimed “collection tool failure” in stating that 19,000 text messages between former FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strozk had been deleted and were unavailable for review by the Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general? Is it worth investigating how the inspector general was able to recover the messages, when the FBI said it could not? Does the FBI lack the technical expertise, or the will? Isn’t it a serious issue that should be addressed, either way? Along the same lines, do you think it strange or inappropriate that the DOJ wiped text messages between Strzok and Page from their special counsel cell phones? The deletions happened shortly after they were ejected from the team and before the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General could review them — at a time when all had been informed that their actions were under review. Did technicians attempt to recover the messages? Were the circumstances of the deletions thoroughly investigated? When did you first learn that the FBI and DOJ signed off on and presented unverified, anti-Trump political opposition research to a court to get wiretaps on an innocent U.S. citizen? Doesn’t this violate the strict procedures enacted while you were FBI director, intended to ensure that only verified information is seen by the court? Who will be held accountable for any lapses in this arena? Do these issues point to larger problems within our intelligence community, in terms of how officials operate? Does that put you in a position where there’s a conflict of interest since you were in charge of the FBI when prior surveillance abuses were identified by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court? Did you consider disclosing this potential conflict and stepping aside, or referring any issues that overlap with your interests? What steps did you take after Strzok and Page were exposed, to try to learn if other investigators on your team likewise were conflicted? Did you take action to segregate the work of these agents and any potential biases they injected into your investigation and team? Wasn’t their behavior a beacon to call you to follow an investigative trail in another direction? Did you become concerned about foreign influence beyond Russia when you learned that a foreign national, Christopher Steele, claimed to have obtained opposition research from Russian officials connected to Putin — and that the FBI and DOJ presented this material to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain wiretap approvals? Were you aware that some Democratic Party officials acknowledged coordinating with Ukraine in 2016 to undermine Trump and his associates and to leak disparaging information to the news media? Is it true that you applied for the job as FBI director but Trump rejected you, the day before then-Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed you as special counsel to investigate Trump? Does that put you in a potentially conflicted position? Do you think Donald Trump is guilty of a crime? If so, then do you believe he is perhaps the most clever criminal of our time since he was able to conceal the evidence despite all the government wiretaps, investigations, informants, surveillance and hundreds of interviews spanning several years?

Clearly, Robert Mueller hopes he has closed the book on his public statements about his investigation. If he has his way, he will not discuss the case further on the record. But his parting shot raised plenty of questions."

One day in 1981, public corruption prosecutor Reid Weingarten flipped open his newspapers and found himself caught in an unpleasant squeeze.

Supporters of an African American federal judge suspected of taking part in a bribery scheme told reporters that Weingarten was a Ronald Reagan-loving ""racist.""

Meanwhile, a combative Republican member of Congress under investigation for violating the Ethics in Government Act took to the press to call him a Jimmy Carter ""lefty.""

Go figure.

Public officials on the radar of law enforcement routinely level accusations of political bias against the men and women who investigate them. But President Trump and his allies in Congress are taking that approach to a new and even corrosive extreme, Weingarten now says.

""The jewel of the crown, no matter what you think about the history of America, has always been, at least for me, the criminal justice system and in particular the federal criminal justice system,"" he said.

""And the very idea that the system is infected by sensitive prosecutive decisions not made on the merits — that that is somehow catching hold in the populace when it's not true. It's profoundly disturbing.""

Corruption buster turned insider

Weingarten's 44-year legal career contains multitudes.

He made his reputation by sending lawmakers to prison and investigating allegations — in 1992! — that a presidential campaign conspired with a foreign adversary to help its own election prospects. Now he defends cabinet secretaries and governors and gives advice to presidents from both political parties.

""I am very proud to say that I have dealt with, directly, every president since Jimmy Carter, and that includes the present president,"" Weingarten said.

That also means he's witnessed or employed nearly every tactic under the sun in the sometimes brutal arena in which politics and prosecution collide.

During the ABSCAM sting operation, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, undercover FBI employees posed as Arab sheikhs handing out bribes to American politicos. The Justice Department secured criminal convictions against one senator and a half dozen House members.

One, a Democrat from South Carolina, was caught on tape saying: ""I've got larceny in my blood.""

For Weingarten, the key question then was how the FBI and Justice Department decided which members of Congress should be approached.

Reagan, a Republican, controlled the White House. But most of the lawmakers snared in the FBI sting were Democrats. Weingarten prosecuted John Jenrette, the Democratic congressman who gleefully blurted about larceny on an FBI wire.

And Weingarten said he was ""absolutely satisfied"" that the FBI and the Justice Department made legitimate decisions ""all the way to the very top,"" free from political influence.

The same goes for Iran-Contra, the scandal that engulfed the White Houses run by Reagan and then President George H.W. Bush.

Former American Bar Association president Lawrence Walsh, an establishment Republican, took years to investigate the contours of the arms-for-hostages scandal. The Reagan and Bush administrations argued the entire probe was infected by partisan bias.

But Weingarten, who prosecuted a Vietnam War hero for lying to Congress about illegal payments, said he had no ""second thoughts.""

""I promise you this the decision to prosecute Richard Secord was not political,"" he said.

Iran-Contra ended with a series of presidential pardons, supported by an attorney general named William Barr. Now, Barr once again occupies a magisterial office on the fifth floor of the Justice Department as only the second person in history to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official two different times.

And Weingarten, who famously attacked special prosecutors in the Clinton era for ""nutty"" and ""wildly misguided"" investigations into his clients — the Democratic secretaries of agriculture and commerce — is speaking out to defend the team led by former special counsel Robert Mueller.

Bias allegations in the Mueller era

When Trump and his allies in Congress call Mueller and his team ""19 angry Democrats,"" Weingarten said, it reflects a profound misunderstanding of the way the Justice Department operates.

""Perhaps on Mueller's team, there were prosecutors who believed Donald Trump was unfit to be president,"" he said. ""And when they went home and took a shower, that's what they thought. When they talked to their children and their mothers and their wives, that's what they said. That's absolutely normal. The issue is — the only issue is — did those feelings infect the investigation?""

That's just now how things work, Weingarten said, even though people sometimes get the wrong impression.

For instance, during the tenure of his friend Eric Holder as attorney general in the Obama administration, Weingarten got at least a call a week, usually from someone in the Middle East or Eastern Europe, trying to get him to use his friendship to ""fix"" their legal problems. That didn't work.

""In my experience, the very idea that a red-blooded federal prosecutor would come to his office and issue subpoenas and make investigative decisions and prosecutive decisions based upon politics — sounds to me absurd,"" he said.

People caught up in allegations of ""bias"" in the Russia investigation saga have argued that irrespective of their own opinions, the structure of the process ensures fairness. Checks and safeguards are built in and stronger than the opinion of any individual person.

One of those is simply the limits of what investigators and prosecutors can do — especially with respect to the president.

Weingarten said that for his part, he's convinced Congress needs to pick up where the 448-page Mueller report ended — by gathering more evidence and public testimony from key witnesses including former White House lawyer Don McGahn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who's now serving time in federal prison for fraud and other offenses.

""Why not conduct a legitimate investigation of everything and why not seek the help of the other side with the understanding that there'll be every opportunity to develop exculpatory evidence?"" he asked.

""Why not have a full record? The idea that the Senate is going after everything they can to attack Hillary Clinton and defend Donald Trump — and the House is doing just the opposite — is inconsistent with how the world should work as I see it. And certainly inconsistent with what happened with the 'October surprise' a million years ago.""

The October surprise

The ""October surprise"" has faded from memory now, but a few decades ago it was an allegation that exploded across the political landscape: Had Reagan's campaign colluded with the government of Iran to delay the release of American hostages until after the presidential election?

After bitter partisan debate, Congress appointed Weingarten to get to the bottom of it. Sen. Jesse Helms, a Republican from North Carolina not known for playing nice with Democrats, summoned the new investigator for a meeting.

""He was incredibly gracious and he said,'I don't believe this happened. I hope it didn't happen. But I want you to go find out if it did happen somewhere somehow,' "" Weingarten recalled. ""That has to happen now and I think we should forget whether or not there is an impeachment for the moment.""

Weingarten spent eight months, fighting limits on his budget, before concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support any conspiracy between the campaign and the Iranians.

A system built to take a strain

Weingarten said he's ""reasonably optimistic"" about the strength of American institutions despite the stresses on the system. He's been around long enough to learn, for one thing, that people on opposite sides of the political aisle or the courtroom can find unexpected common ground.

That African American judge he prosecuted in the early 1980s won an acquittal in court, but was impeached by the U.S. House and removed from office by the Senate. Then, Florida voters elected Rep. Alcee Hastings to a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives — where he still serves today.

Several years after having being bested by Hastings at the courthouse and testifying as a witness in the impeachment proceedings, Weingarten remembered getting a mind-blowing phone call. Hastings asked him to take a job leading another investigation, this time for his congressional subcommittee.

""I said, 'Judge, maybe you shouldn't have your prosecutor in that role. People might talk.' ""

""It was pretty funny,"" he said. ""That's a Washington story."""
House Democrats move to hold Attorney General Barr and Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt,https://www.salon.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/04/house-democrats-move-to-hold-attorney-general-barr-and-commerce-secretary-ross-in-contempt/,"House Democrats are moving to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena seeking information about the White House's efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on Monday announced the move in separate letters to both members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

Advertisement:

""Unfortunately, your actions are part of a pattern,"" the Maryland Democrat wrote. ""The Trump administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate, extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and departments of the government and across numerous investigations.""

Cummings indicated he would consider postponing the contempt votes, which have not yet been scheduled, if Barr and Ross turn over the requested documents to the committee by Thursday.

If the panel officially schedules a contempt vote, it would be the second such vote held against the attorney general. The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines last month to hold Barr in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena to provide lawmakers with an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Ross has turned down requests from the panel to testify about the citizenship question.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee first issued the subpoenas in April, as part of its investigation into the origins of the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the next census.

The committee has also authorized subpoenas for John Gore, the principal deputy assistant for the Justice Department's civil rights division. Gore appeared before the committee behind closed doors in March, although he refused to answer specific questions from lawmakers about his role in the Trump administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, prompting Cummings to issue the subpoena to compel him to respond to the unanswered questions. Barr directed Gore not to comply with the subpoena for his testimony after the panel declined to allow a Justice Department attorney to be in the room with Gore.

In the letters, Cummings pointed to new evidence filed in court last week by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which claims the citizenship question was added at the urging of Thomas Hofeller, a now-deceased GOP redistricting expert who argued that adding such a question to the census would be ""advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites"" by prompting a redrawing of certain congressional districts. The ACLU also alleged the language Hofeller drafted was used in a Justice Department memo requesting the question be included on the census.

The Justice Department has denied those allegations, describing the ACLU's claims as a last-minute campaign to derail the Supreme Court's consideration of the citizenship question. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has argued that adding a citizenship question to the census would allow it to better enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The ACLU has disputed those characterizations.

In his letter, Cummings pointed out that new evidence suggests the true reason the White House sought to add the citizenship question was ""to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways.""

Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, noted that the Supreme Court was already hearing arguments over the 2020 census and claimed Cummings' move was ""a reckless and transparent attempt"" to interfere with that litigation.

""Chairman Cummings' interest in the census is entirely about scoring political points, not conducting meaningful oversight,"" Jordan said in a statement. ""The Democrats' desperation to affect the outcome of the case raises the question: why don't they want to know how many American citizens are in the United States of America?""

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Commerce Department said in a statement that the agency has ""worked in good faith with the committee"" and has already turned over nearly 14,000 pages of documents about the citizenship question.

""The Committee has taken this extraordinary step to compel production of documents protected by longstanding and well-settled privileges, including the government's right to protect confidential attorney-client and deliberative communications, which has been upheld in court,"" the spokesperson said. ""To any objective observer, it is abundantly clear that the committee's intent is not to find facts but to desperately and improperly influence the Supreme Court with mere insinuations and conspiracy theories.""

Three federal judges already ruled this year to block the Trump administration from adding the citizenship question to the 2020 census, but the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments for the Justice Department's appeal of the decision. The high court's conservative majority signaled during oral arguments earlier this year that they would rule in favor of including the question."
House To Vote To Hold Attorney General In Contempt,https://www.outsidethebeltway.com,['Doug Mataconis'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/house-to-vote-to-hold-attorney-general-in-contempt/,"House To Vote To Hold Attorney General In Contempt

The House of Representatives will vote to hold the Attorney General in contempt next week but it may not mean anything.

Doug Mataconis · · 7 comments

Early in May, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt due to his failure to turn over a full unredacted copy of the report filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller regarding his investigation. Since then, the matter has sat relatively dormant, in no small part because the House has been on an extended break coinciding with Memorial Day. That break is over, though, and it now appears that the House is prepared to act:

The House will vote next week to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for declining to comply with a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report and related evidence.

The resolution will also target former White House counsel Don McGahn, who has defied a Democratic subpoena to appear before Congress. The vote, scheduled for June 11, marks a major escalation of tensions between the Trump administration and House Democrats, who have launched a series of investigations into the president’s conduct in office — probes in which the White House has largely refused to cooperate.

“The Attorney General can’t ignore a legal subpoena and get away with it,” tweeted Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. (…) The contempt vote offers a way for House Democrats to make an aggressive move against the Trump administration that stops short of impeachment as the number of lawmakers endorsing the beginning of such an inquiry grew on Monday to more than 50.

“This Administration’s systematic refusal to provide Congress with answers and cooperate with Congressional subpoenas is the biggest cover-up in American history, and Congress has a responsibility to provide oversight on behalf of the American people,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement.

Tensions with Barr have intensified since March, when Mueller released his report on Russian interference in the 2016 elections. And they bubbled up once again last week after Mueller delivered remarks from the Justice Department — his first public comments over the course of the two-year investigation — in which he explicitly declined to exonerate President Trump of obstruction of justice crimes.

The civil contempt resolution will allow the House Judiciary Committee to pursue enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court. It will further authorize House committees that have issued subpoenas that are also ignored to seek legal action.

“I think people want to see us holding this administration accountable. This is an important way of doing it,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a Judiciary Committee member who chairs House Democrats’ messaging arm, said after a leadership meeting on Monday.

The dispute with the Justice Department generally and Barr in particular centers around the delays that have been encountered in the Justice Department’s response to demands for an un-redacted copy of the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. There are also ongoing disputes regarding subpoenas for other documents related to the Russia probe sent to both the Justice Department and the White House. So far at least, the Administration has sought to obstruct those subpoenas and refuse to provide the documents in question, a move that sets up the probability of a court battle between the House and the White House over document production, a legal fight that could last well into the 2020 election cycle and which would likely eventually have to be resolved by the Supreme Court. The most recent development in the matter came just hours before yesterday’s committee vote when the Trump Administration officially invoked Executive Privilege with respect to providing a full copy of the Mueller report. As I explained in my post at the time, while there may be some parts of the full Mueller Report that should properly remain confidential, the idea that the entire report is covered by Executive Privilege is dubious at best.

Given the Democratic majority in the House, it’s likely that the contempt vote will be successful. If it is, it will be only the second time in American history that a chamber of Congress has held a Cabinet member in contempt. The first time occurred seven years ago when the House Oversight Committee voted to hold then Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for his alleged failure to provide documents related to the so-called “Fast & Furious” investigation. That vote was quickly followed up by a vote by the full House of Representatives to do the same which, like the Committee vote, fell largely on party lines. After the House vote, the matter was referred to the Justice Department, which of course declined to act on the matter. This led the House to file a civil contempt proceeding in U.S. District Court in Washington which essentially died when Holder left office after 2012 election. Interestingly enough, the Obama Administration also attempted to use Executive Privilege to prevent a contempt citation in that case.

The procedure with respect to this contempt citation is likely to be the same, although it seems as though it will be sped up to some degree. Since it is already apparent that the Trump Justice Department will decline to pursue and contempt prosecution for Barr, the House is apparently planning on proceeding directly to a civil lawsuit in Federal District Court in the District of Columbia seeking to enforce the contempt citation. Whether that is enough to persuade Barr and the Administration to comply with the subpoena remains to be seen but the likelihood is that it will not."

The process requires thought, attention to detail, coordination with the State Department, and adhering to the highest levels of protocol, and it appears they delivered. Finding the best gifts can be complex -- it should be personal and most nod to some sort of historical touchstone between the two countries, or the gifter and the receiver.

The Trumps came bearing a Tiffany & Co. silver and silk poppy brooch in a custom White House wood jewelry box in a red leather box for Queen Elizabeth II, according to the White House.

For her husband, Prince Philip, they brought a personalized Air Force One jacket and signed autobiography by American General and famed World War II air commander James Doolittle, ""I Could Never Be So Lucky Again.""

Though Prince Philip left active duty naval service when he married then-Princess Elizabeth, he holds a number of military appointments, including as Marshal of the Royal Air Force.

Hope Hicks: White House 'tells Trump's former communications director not to cooperate with subpoena',https://www.independent.co.uk,['Clark Mindock'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hope-hicks-subpoena-annie-donaldson-trump-mueller-congress-documents-a8943936.html,"The White House has reportedly instructed former officials Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson not to give the House Judiciary Committee documents related to their time working for the president, in the latest conflict between congressional investigators and the West Wing following the release of the Mueller report.

Ms Hicks, a former Donald Trump campaign aide who later served as the White House communications director, could still hand over documents to the committee related to her work on the campaign, reportedly because that period of work does not fall under executive privilege designations. She has already testified at least once in front of a congressional regarding issues related to the campaign. That was in 2018, and the 9-hour closed door testimony came just before she resigned from her post in the White House.

The White House has reportedly asserted executive privilege over Ms Hicks testifying about her work for Mr Trump as president, with the chief of staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly reportedly telling her and Ms Donaldson not to testify before the committee. Letters were sent to the congressional committee that had issued subpoenas to Ms Hicks and Ms Donaldson.

Ms Donaldson was served as chief of staff for former White House counsel Don McGahn, and provided former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation with detailed notes indicating Mr Trump attempted to get Mr Mueller fired.

Ms Donaldson and Ms Hicks are both scheduled to testify before the committees later this month, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler said in response to the White House's executive privilege assertion that he expects both women to be held in contempt of Congress if they refuse to honour the subpoenas.

Asked if the two would be held in contempt if they do not comply with their investigation into Mr Trump's potential obstruction of the Russia investigation, Mr Nadler told reporters: ""I would assume so.""

The decision to instruct the two women not to hand over documents to the congressional committee comes just a day after Democrats in Congress moved forward on two notable fronts. On Monday, House committees announced that they were planning public hearings related to the Mueller probe, including related to Mr Trump's potential obstruction of the Mueller probe. Other Democrats also announced that they would proceed with contempt charges for attorney general William Barr, who has refused to hand over the fully un-redacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence to Congress.

That contempt hearing is scheduled for next week, and would be one of the first steps for Democrats to take the Justice Department and White House to court over those documents."

Thousands of Brits Protest Trump’s Visit Alongside 16-Foot Farting Presidential Robot,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-in-britain-thousands-of-brits-protest-presidents-visit-alongside-16-foot-farting-robot,"LONDON—Thousands of Brits took to the streets here Tuesday, where they marched alongside a 16-foot farting robot of Donald Trump and held aloft huge photos of John McCain in an attempt to trigger the president.

The protests—which saw thousands brave the typical British weather shielded by umbrellas emblazoned with anti-Trump slogans, EU flags, and the LGBTQ rainbow symbol—went within meters of Downing Street, where the president must have heard creatively foul-mouthed chants, although he still insists there have been no protests against him at all.

Protesters were kept away from the gates of Downing Street for Trump’s arrival and departure for talks with Theresa May. However, the thousands occupied a large stretch of central London, marching from Trafalgar Square past the government buildings of Whitehall and eventually arriving outside parliament to hear a speech by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

As always, the protesters in Britain clearly put a lot of effort into their preparations to mock Trump. The most eye-catching part of the parade was a huge robotic statue named the Trump Dump, which featured the gigantic president atop a golden toilet, with a smartphone in his agitating hand. It emitted farting noises and the catchphrase “no collusion.”

“I wanted to honor him by showing him in all his glory,” the monster’s creator, Don Lessem, explained to The Daily Beast, claiming it cost him $25,000 of his own cash. “It’s 16 feet, which is the size of his ego. We wanted to match that. It needs to be a little more orange I think, but we tried to do it as proportionally accurate as possible, so his penis is three millimeters.”

Lessem’s ultimate goal is to crowdfund an effort to bring the robot to Washington, D.C. for the July 4 celebrations, but he was proud to give it its “world debut” to coincide with the president’s trip to London.

There were thousands of slightly less extravagant attempts to ridicule the president during his visit. On Monday, he dubiously claimed that he had been greeted by “tremendous crowds of well wishers” rather than protests and that there was “great love all around” on his first state visit.

On the contrary, the crowd couldn’t have displayed any more antipathy for him, even though there appeared to be smaller numbers than a huge protest against him last year. Signs showed various degrees of exasperation, ranging from the playful “Who invited this wally anyway?” to the frank “You’re a racist twat, mate,” to the laconic “Fuck this fucking fucker.”

One popular choice appeared to be showing images of the late Senator John McCain, following reports last week that the White House ordered the USS John S. McCain to be hidden from Trump’s sight in Japan.

Jeffrey Kaser Paradi explained to The Daily Beast: “I never thought I’d be holding a photograph of a Republican ever in my life, but after last week when the White House instructed the Navy to cover up the name of the battleship for fear of triggering Donald Trump. You know, I’d just hate for him to see an image of him on his trip here to the U.K..”

The protest was largely good-natured and police seemed relaxed. It was clear that the protest was also about Britain’s own political crises, with the anti-Trump marchers displaying a lot of support for the European Union and the pro-Trump marchers being very supportive of Brexit.

There were some scenes in the crowd that perhaps went slightly too far when the two sides clashed. One small, paper U.S. flag was torn from one pro-Trump marcher and stomped upon, while a Make America Great Again hat was snatched from the head of a Trump supporter and dumped in a fresh pile of dung left behind by one of the police horses.

But the anti-Trump marchers’ activity was largely limited to chants and songs, a lot of which were based on classic British music. For example, a somewhat predictable remix of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” that replaced the word “brick” with something a little ruder.

Trump supporters were vastly outnumbered, largely white and male, and they were significantly angrier than the anti-Trump marchers. They marched with QAnon and anti-George Soros flags, were abusive toward rival protesters, and many proudly espoused extreme right-wing views.

One group calling itself Scots for Trump gathered at the protest with a big banner and were led by a well-known activist, Alistair McConnachie, who has previously made headlines in Scotland for denying that Jews were murdered in gas chambers in Nazi Germany. “That’s not something I would speak about because whenever you speak about it only gets yourself into hot water,” he told The Daily Beast when questioned about it.

McConnachie’s main beliefs appeared to be supporting Trump for “standing up very strongly for the principle of borders,” while also campaigning vociferously against Scottish independence. Asked why he supports a rigid border system between Mexico and the U.S. but argues so strongly against it between England and Scotland, his only attempt at an explanation was that the Scottish border “only exists in the imagination.”

During a press conference with May later Tuesday, Trump wrongly claimed there were “thousands of people” on the streets cheering him on both days of his visit so far and that he didn’t see any protesters. He does have supporters, but from Tuesday afternoon’s evidence they appeared to be nothing more than a handful of oddballs with extreme views.

Trump could be confused or, more likely, willfully wrong. But if he wants to see the evidence for himself he need only pop outside, with an umbrella."
Trump Today: President says U.K. trade pact has tremendous potential as he calls protests against him fake news,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Robert Schroeder', 'White House Reporter']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-today-president-says-uk-trade-pact-has-tremendous-potential-as-he-calls-protests-against-him-fake-news-2019-06-04,"Getty Images British Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump in London on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. was committed to what he called a “phenomenal” trade deal with the United Kingdom, as he met outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May and dismissed protests against him as “fake news.”

U.K. TRADE PACT

Speaking alongside May at a joint news conference, Trump said there’s “tremendous potential” for a U.S.-U.K. trade pact, claiming the two nations could do two or three times the amount of trade they’re now conducting.

The U.S. goods and services trade surplus with the U.K. was $19.9 billion in 2018, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, and the U.K. is currently the U.S.’s seventh-largest goods trading partner. As Britain struggles to pull itself out of the European Union, however, any bilateral trade agreement faces challenges. As The Wall Street Journal writes, if the U.K. decides to maintain close economic ties with the EU after it leaves the bloc, that would restrict it from striking free-trade deals with other countries, including the U.S.

Trump also called reports of protests against him “fake news” even as he was greeted by thousands of protesters in London. He also said he thought either former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson or current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt would “do a very good job” as prime minister, reiterated criticisms of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and said he saw “no limitations” on intelligence sharing with the U.K., as the U.S. presses the country to ban Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.

Trump earlier this month issued an order aimed at banning equipment from Huawei from U.S. networks because of spying concerns. The company denies involvement in Chinese spying.

MEXICO TARIFFS

Trump also said he’s still planning to slap tariffs on Mexican imports beginning next week, even as he held out some hope that a deal can be struck over migrants to the U.S.

“We’ll probably be talking during the time that tariffs are on, and they’re going to be paid,” Trump said.

Read: Here are the 6 stocks threatened most by new tariffs on Mexico.

On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard are scheduled to meet. Last week, Trump announced tariffs in retaliation for what he says is Mexico’s failure to curb the flow of Central American families heading to the U.S.

Trump has threatened to slap a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports beginning June 10. If the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner doesn’t then take action to satisfy Trump, the president said tariffs would climb over time to 25% on Oct. 1.

U.S. stocks DJIA, +1.60% COMP, +1.83% SPX, +1.52% were rattled after Trump’s Mexico announcement last week, but indexes were trading higher on Tuesday following remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that investors took as signs that the central bank might cut interest rates.

Trump says he turned down Corbyn's request to meet,https://www.theguardian.com,['Rowena Mason'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/trump-says-he-turned-down-corbyn-request-to-meet,"Donald Trump has revealed he turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet, as the Labour leader joined a protest against his state visit and declined to attend a dinner hosted by the Queen.

The US president said he did not know Corbyn but that he seemed like “somewhat of a negative force”.

Speaking at a press conference alongside Theresa May on Tuesday, Trump said of Corbyn: “He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that.”

He added: “I really don’t like critics as much as I like and respect someone who can get things done.”

Labour revealed on Tuesday that Corbyn would join a demonstration against the US president, saying it was an opportunity to “stand in solidarity with those [Trump has] attacked in America, around the world and in our own country”.

A Labour spokesperson said: “Jeremy Corbyn proposed a meeting with Donald Trump during the president’s visit. Jeremy is ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis.”

Q&A Itinerary: What will Trump be doing during his UK state visit? Show Hide After arriving in the UK on Air Force One on Monday 3 June, US president Donald Trump will be formally welcomed in a ceremony in the gardens of Buckingham Palace. It will be attended by the Queen and Prince Charles. The president will then attend a private lunch at the palace, which is expected to be attended by Prince Harry, but not his wife, who Trump recently described as 'nasty'. Following a wreath-laying ceremony in Westminster Abbey, Donald Trump will join Prince Charles for an afternoon tea at Clarence House. The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry will then host a state banquet in the evening, which will be attended by prominent US citizens who live in the UK, as well as political and civic leaders. On Tuesday 4 June the visit includes a breakfast meeting with Prince Andrew, and then talks and a press conference with prime minister Theresa May at Downing Street. On the Tuesday evening Trump hosts a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador. On Wednesday 5 June Trump will take part in commemoration services in Portsmouth to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The day ends with the Queen formally bidding farewell to the US president. Trump’s entourage will also include two identical seven-seat black armoured limousines nicknamed ‘The Beast’, and a number of presidential helicopters. The president has at his side at all times one of five rotating military aides who carry the nuclear ‘football’ which can trigger a missile strike - equipped with communication tools and a book with prepared war plans.

Trump also took the opportunity to continue his public feud with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, saying he had done a bad job and “hurts the great people of this country”.

The president dismissed the protest outside Downing Street as very small and “fake news”, while claiming thousands had lined the streets to cheer him on Monday.

Trump was pressed several times about relations with the UK after Brexit and claimed there would be a “phenomenal” trade deal between the two countries involving two or three times the current level of trade.

But he insisted healthcare would be on the table in remarks that suggest the US would insist its companies are allowed to bid for private NHS contracts.

The prime minister had to whisper to Trump to apparently explain what the NHS was, but when the question was clarified, he said: “I think everything with the trade deal is on the table. When you’re dealing on trade, everything is on the table. So NHS or anything else. A lot more than that. Everything will be on the table.”

May quickly suggested that might not be acceptable to the UK but did not rule it out. “The point about making trade deals is that both sides negotiate and come to an agreement about what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future,” she said.

His comments indicate the US would also want access to UK markets for its food producers despite concerns about its lower environmental and animal welfare standards, which could lead to products such as chlorine-washed chicken being sold in the UK.

Trump also made some cryptic remarks suggesting May could be about to water down her plan to let Huawei, the Chinese state company, have limited involvement in the UK’s new 5G communications network.

The US, which has banned Huawei from its own contracts, had signalled this could harm intelligence sharing between the two countries.

But Trump said there should be “no problem” with intelligence sharing between the US and the UK based on his conversations with May.

“We are going to have an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We’ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner and we’ll have no problem with that.”

A No 10 spokesman would say only that there was a review of the Huawei plans under way."
CNN’s Chris Cuomo Blasts Donald Trump For Endangering Thousands Of AT&T Livelihoods “Out Of Spite”,https://deadline.com,['Greg Evans'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://deadline.com/2019/06/chris-cuomo-cnn-donald-trump-closing-arguments-endangering-livelihoods-spite-1202626588/,"In a blistering rebuke to President Donald Trump’s tweeted-from-London suggestion that people stop subscribing to AT&T in order to force “big changes” at CNN, the network’s Chris Cuomo accused the president of caring more for his own hurt feelings than the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

“Does the president really want people to lose jobs so that CNN won’t cover his lies as often?,” Cuomo asked during the “Closing Argument” segment of his Cuomo Prime Time show on CNN Monday night. “Yes is the answer.”

Watch the Cuomo segment below.

The CNN host’s comments came in response to Trump’s tweets earlier Monday after the president arrived for his state visit in London. (See all tweets below.)

“Just arrived in the United Kingdom,” Trump tweeted yesterday. “The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something?”

Then, in a second tweet, Trump wrote: “I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches @CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!”

After pointing out that “stopped” has two Ps, Cuomo noted that AT&T employs “268,000 people, including your boy here.” Noting that the president investigated the possibility of litigation and using the Department of Justice to halt the AT&T-Time Warner merger, Cuomo said the president “would use his power to punish” the thousands of families that depend on AT&T paychecks “out of spite.”

“This is America,” Cuomo said. “We don’t have presidents who punish companies that don’t flatter him. Nothing great again about taking America down the path of the despot. We have never had a President call for Americans to boycott a company he doesn’t like.”

Cuomo ended the segment by suggesting that Trump could learn a thing or two from The Queen of England. “I’ve never thought I would argue this,” Cuomo said, “but we might be in a better place in this country right now if the president were more like The Queen…providing a message that puts unity first, regardless of…personal stake.”

Here are Trump’s tweets, followed by Cuomo’s “Closing Argument.”

Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches @CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019"
Progressives want the must-pass defense budget to tie Trump’s hands with Saudi Arabia,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/4/18650576/ndaa-trump-saudi-arabia-yemen-progressives,"Progressive lawmakers and activists are plotting their next move to hold President Donald Trump accountable over his relationship with Saudi Arabia, hoping to tie the president’s hands with the national defense funding bill.

The open question is, does the larger Congress, which only a few months ago took a historic vote to rebuke Trump’s foreign policy, still care about the war in Yemen?

In April, Congress passed a historic War Powers Resolution directing Trump to remove troops involved in “hostilities” in Yemen, a Saudi-led war that’s killed more than 50,000 and left tens of millions in need of humanitarian aid. Trump vetoed it, committed to the US’s long-standing alliance with the Saudis — not to mention his personal relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (the same MBS who called for Saudi Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s killing).

Now, as the House prepares to tackle the annual national defense budget — a massive spending bill that will likely amount to more than $700 billion in military funding — progressives see an opening to force Trump’s hand in the Middle East. On Tuesday, a coalition of more than 40 activist groups sent every House lawmaker a letter demanding they include provisions to ban the transfer, sale, or export of any defense materials that would be used in the war in Yemen for a minimum of two years, and end all US aid — from intelligence to logistical support — to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the war.

The defense bill is seen as a must-do in Congress; it has passed despite deep partisan divisions every year for more than 50 years. Activists say it’s necessary to use the NDAA as a vehicle to take action on Yemen, because the stakes couldn’t be higher.

Since his veto, Trump’s administration has escalated tensions with Iran and sidestepped Congress to unilaterally authorize $8 billion in arms sales, including to Saudi Arabia and its allies. For four years, the United States has been providing the Saudi-led coalition with intelligence, arms, and ammunition, and, until late last year, fuel for their warplanes. The planes that bombed a school bus, killing at least 40 children last August, did so with an American-made bomb.

Passing the War Powers Resolution with a bipartisan coalition was a monumental moment. It took incredible lobbying from anti-war activists, as well as internal pressure from progressive leaders like Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Chris Murphy (D-CT), to not only win over conservatives but also Democrats’ own leadership.

Now that group is hoping they can build the same energy behind the defense bill.

“We are trying to stiffen the resolve of members of Congress as we approach the consideration of the national defense budget,” said Hassan El-Tayyab, the co-director of Just Foreign Policy, a progressive foreign policy group. “We have the momentum here. What remains to be seen is whether [Congress] has the resolve to do what it takes.”

Congress has options. Will it take them?

The US was involved in the Saudi-led war before Trump took office. But by rejecting congressional attempts to end that involvement, he has cemented American fingerprints on one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world: According to the most recent United Nations report, 80 percent of the Yemeni population — 24 million people — is in need of humanitarian assistance.

Lawmakers, however, have a couple ways they could still weigh in on the use of the American military’s resources in this conflict.

Congress’ opposition to Trump’s policy around Yemen really caught bipartisan steam last year — closely tied to the shock and outrage over the killing of Saudi journalist, dissident, and American resident Jamal Khashoggi and Trump’s sympathetic response to Saudi interests. Trump has repeatedly emphasized his support for MBS, calling him a “great ally.” In March, reports showed that the United States approved six secret authorizations to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear power technology, which both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have warned could aid a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Trump’s administration and Republican leadership campaigned hard against the War Powers Resolution. But in the end, anti-war activists and progressive lawmakers won the fight in Congress, passing lawmakers’ first rebuke of the executive branch’s involvement in foreign wars since 1973. Now, they want to do the same to defeat Trump’s veto. The letter to lawmakers is asking for provisions almost identical to those in the War Powers Resolution on Yemen, as well as a bipartisan proposal from Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Todd Young (R-IN) that would ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia. That proposal, from 2018, also codified the Trump administration’s decision to stop refueling Saudi warplanes.

“These aren’t muscles Congress is used to flexing: Without constant pressure from activists they might succumb to the inertia that’s defined Congress’ posture on the matters for the last of couple decades, born from a mix of capture, wrongheadedness, and obliviousness to their own power,” David Segal, the executive director of Demand Progress, said.

House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office has said the war in Yemen remains a top priority, but it’s less clear what House Democrats’ strategy will be. Her office did not respond for comment on using the National Defense Authorization Act as a vehicle to act on Yemen.

“We continue to consider all viable options to end this humanitarian crisis,” Pelosi’s spokesperson said previously. Khanna, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said progressives will be leading the charge on the NDAA process.

There’s also a push for Pelosi to take Trump to court over his veto of the War Powers Resolution. A group of constitutional scholars backed a letter saying Trump’s unilateral decision to involve the United States in a war that Congress has expressly rebuked is unconstitutional.

Of course, there are uphill battles on all fronts. For one, Congress tying Trump’s hands on the defense funding bill would be a bold move that will undoubtedly run up against the interests of Congress’ many defense hawks. And it would have to pass the Republican majority in the Senate. As for a court case, there’s always the possibility that the Supreme Court wouldn’t take on the case. For now, activists are focusing on building the same coalition that passed the War Powers Resolution just two months ago.

“It’s really critical that they push it all the way because we are in this moment where clearly the executive branch is wanting to overreach,” El-Tayyab said. “Congress should set a precedent for future administrations. We think it’s critical.”"

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)

LONDON (AP) — Making nice at the end, President Donald Trump eased up Tuesday on his frequent criticism of outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May over her handling of the tortured Brexit deal, declaring that history will remember her fondly if the United Kingdom can successfully leave the European Union.

The latest chapter in the allies’ storied “special relationship” played out as anti-Trump protesters — and the infamous Trump baby balloon — thronged the streets of nearby central London.

The president’s unexpected compliments for May come just days before she was set to resign the leadership of her party after failing to secure a Brexit deal. She will depart as prime minister once her successor has been chosen.

“I have greatly enjoyed working with you. You are a tremendous professional and a person who loves her country very much,” Trump told May at a news conference near the prime minister’s Downing Street office. But he couldn’t resist a slight dig, evoking the two years of broadsides he had lobbed at her by recalling that he urged her to sue the EU rather than try to negotiate a departure.

Trump said he would have “sued and settled, maybe, but you never know. She’s probably a better negotiator than I am.” And he added that the deal May came away with was a good one and “perhaps you won’t be given the credit you deserve.”

May, who fought back tears when she announced her resignation last month, voiced hope her successor will be able to achieve Brexit.

“I still believe —I personally believe— that it is in the best interest of the U.K. to leave the European Union with a deal. I believe there is a good deal on the table,” she said. “Obviously, it will be whoever succeeds me as prime minister to take this issue forward. What is paramount, I believe, is delivering on Brexit for the British people.”

Earlier in the day, Trump jokingly suggested that May “stick around” until a new U.S.-U.K. trade deal was brokered. May and her aides chuckled at that.

Trump said Britain and the U.S. would be able to strike a “phenomenal trade deal” once the U.K. had left the EU — music to the ears of pro-Brexit Britons. But, in words sure to alarm those in Britain concerned about Brexit, he said that “everything”— including the National Health Service — would be “on the table” in future trade negotiations.

Most Britons are protective of the state-run NHS, which delivers free health care to all, and many worry private U.S. health care firms could try to gain access to chunks of it as a condition of a trade deal.

On a separate issue, Trump said he anticipated “no limitations” on the future sharing of intelligence with the U.K. as the U.S. continues to press its longtime ally to ban Chinese company Huawei amid espionage and trade concerns.

Traditionally, U.S. presidents avoid injecting themselves into the domestic politics of other nations. But Trump didn’t hold back — right after claiming that he would not comment on Britain’s internal matters.

He renewed his praise of Conservative lawmaker Boris Johnson, who is campaigning to replace May as Conservative leader, and of another contender, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He said he’d turned down a requested meeting from Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, and took new swipes at one of his most vocal critics, London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Trump previously had voiced support for a “hard Brexit,” which could have a devastating impact on the U.K. economy, according to many experts. That stands in contrast to a previous White House position that the departure should be as painless as possible. Others in the U.K. are pressing for a second referendum that could keep Britain in the EU.

As the pageantry of Trump’s British state visit gave way to politics, an economic meeting between the leaders at St. James’s Palace brought together 10 leading companies — five from the U.K. and five from the United States. CEOs and senior representatives from BAE Systems, GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, Barclays, Reckitt Benckiser, JP Morgan, Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs International, Bechtel and Splunk were listed as attending.

While the corporate leaders gathered, protesters began to assemble across London, some of whom had balloon of a crying baby Trump bobbing in the air near Parliament Square. Leaders of Britain’s main opposition party were expected to join demonstrators at a rally in Trafalgar Square, just up the street from May’s Downing Street office. Also in Trafalgar Square: a 16-foot robotic likeness of Trump seated on a golden toilet.

The day of meetings with May followed a whirlwind of pomp, circumstance and protest for Trump, who on Monday had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and tea with Prince Charles before a grand state dinner at Buckingham Palace.

Following Tuesday’s focus on business and trade, Trump will use the next two days to mark the 75th anniversary of the June 6, 1944, D-Day landing, likely the last significant commemoration most veterans of the battle will see. The events will begin in Portsmouth, England, where the invasion was launched, and then move across the English Channel to France, where Allied forces began to recapture Western Europe from the Nazis.

French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to use the occasion to call for strengthening multinational ties the U.S. president has frayed.

Progressive Coalition Urges Nancy Pelosi To Begin Impeachment Proceedings,https://www.huffpost.com,['Breaking News Intern'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/progressive-coalition-letter-nancy-pelosi-impeachment_n_5cf6760ae4b0a1997b7135eb,"A coalition of grassroots progressive groups sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Tuesday urging her to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

The letter, signed by 30 groups including Credo Action and the Women’s March, expressed “deep disappointment and concern” over Pelosi’s leadership, criticizing her “political excuses” to not begin impeachment proceedings.

“Waiting is a privilege,” the letter reads. “But it is not a privilege available to the families separated by his deportation force or his Muslim ban, or the asylum seekers languishing in Mexico, or people threatened by his embrace of white supremacy, or the LGBTQ people whose rights he is taking away, or the women whose bodies he is trying to control or the communities threatened by his denial of the climate crisis.”

Among the 30 groups that have signed are Credo, a cellphone network operator that champions progressive causes; Justice Democrats, a political action committee closely aligned with several progressive lawmakers who have already called for impeachment; RAICES, a migrant rights group that has been vocally critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policies; and Women’s March, a women-led movement that has championed a range of issues.

Pelosi has cautioned against moving forward with impeachment proceedings without an “ironclad” case against the president. But she is facing increased pressure since special counsel Robert Mueller gave a public statement last week on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice. Many Democratic lawmakers and nearly half of the Democratic presidential candidates have called to begin the impeachment process.

“In the very near future, the Trump era will be one that evokes the question ― what did you do?” the letter concludes. “We urge you to use your power to lead and to stop asking us to wait.”

Opinion | Democratic Voters Want Impeachment. The House Dawdles.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/opinion/impeachment-trump.html,"Until quite recently, Democratic House leaders justified their refusal to begin an inquiry into impeaching Donald Trump by saying that it wasn’t something their rank-and-file voters cared about. “I can tell you I never hear somebody bring up the Mueller report,” Representative Cheri Bustos, chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in Chicago last month.

After the Memorial Day recess, that argument is no longer tenable. Across the country, Democratic voters have begun demanding that their representatives take a position on impeachment. “At virtually every town hall, round table, or even, today, a kaffeeklatsch at a senior center, people want to know what we are going to do about this guy,” Mary Gay Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told me. Scanlon is vice chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee, which would oversee an impeachment inquiry, and two weeks ago she came out in favor of starting the process.

“There’s been a shift,” said Madeleine Dean, a freshman Democrat from Pennsylvania who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, and also wants to begin an impeachment inquiry. At a town hall last week, one of the first questions she was asked was about impeachment. When she visited local stores and barbershops, she told me, constituents approached her and said, of Trump, “You cannot let the behavior stand.”

On Friday, Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes that he’d come around to supporting an impeachment inquiry after speaking to people in his district: “To the person, everybody said, ‘What are you all going to do about President Trump?’” Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told me, “I had about a dozen events this weekend, and there was an overwhelming sense that we have been presented with abundant evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors and we need to launch an inquiry.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of people protested in central London on Tuesday against U.S. President Donald Trump’s pomp-laden state visit to Britain, but numbers were well down on the tens of thousands who gathered to oppose his visit last year.

Protesters shouted, banged drums and waved placards at what organizers called a “Carnival of Resistance” in Trafalgar Square while Prime Minister Theresa May held talks with Trump a short distance away at her Downing Street residence.

The leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, addressed the rally, calling it “the living embodiment of what a democratic society was all about”.

Among Britons, Trump is one of the least-liked foreign leaders, with just 21% of people surveyed by YouGov having a positive opinion of him. Among women, that figure fell to 14%.

The protest’s tone was set by a large statue of Trump sitting on a golden lavatory with his trousers around his ankles. People held placards that read “Keep your tiny hands off our Queen”, “Lock him in the tower” and “Free Melania!”

Linda Coplestone, 64, a retired teacher from London, said she was protesting inaction by Trump on climate change.

“We have ruined the planet,” she said. “He has a powerful voice and could do something about it. He chooses not to.”

Often with creativity and humor, the protesters rallied around issues ranging from restrictions on women’s reproductive rights to fears that U.S. businesses would carve up Britain’s ailing but cherished health service.

The crowd, several thousand strong, was far smaller than the one that protested Trump’s first visit to Britain as president in July 2018, but featured the same British humor.

One woman carried a sign carrying the Shakespearean insult, “I bite my thumb at thee!” Elsewhere, a man sold toilet rolls featuring Trump’s face for three pounds a piece.

There were pockets of support. A few men wearing red caps with “Make America Great Again” walked among the crowd. Trump supporters said the protests were an insult to the leader of the United Kingdom’s most powerful ally.

TRUMP BABY BLIMP

A giant inflatable blimp depicting Trump as a sneering baby in a diaper flew outside the British parliament, remaining airborne as the president held talks with May.

Trump and his wife Melania arrived on Monday for a three-day state visit that included a banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening.

The protesters have been largely kept away from Trump, with roads closed around Buckingham Palace and Downing Street.

Trump said he was loved in Britain despite the protests. He said he was closer to Britain than any other American leader, citing his mother’s Scottish roots and the two golf courses he owns in the country.

He said on Tuesday he had seen thousands of people on the streets cheering during his visit.

“I heard that there were protests,” he told reporters. “I said: ‘Where are the protests? I don’t see any protests.’

“I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons.”

Opposition in Britain to Trump’s presidency has been stoked by his ban on travel to the United States from several mainly Muslim countries, his decision to quit a global deal on combating climate change and a host of other issues.

As one woman’s makeshift sign read: “I am going to need more cardboard.”

Trump warns Republicans not to block latest Mexico tariff,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-warns-republicans-not-to-block-latest-mexico-tariff-237bd640180f/,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned Republicans lawmakers not to try and stop his new 5% tariff on Mexican imports, saying it would be foolish to try and intervene.

“I don’t think they will do that,” he said, speaking to reporters during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May.

The tariff is set to take effect next week, Trump said, noting that they “haven’t really started yet.”

“I don’t think they will do that, if they do, it’s foolish,” he added. “There’s nothing more important than borders.”

Trump announced the 5% tariff at the end of last month, tweeting on May 30 that the percentage would “gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied.” The rate would hit a maximum of 25% by October if he followed through on his threat.

“On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,” he wrote, saying that once immigration was under control, the tariff would be removed.

The Washington Post, along with several other outlets, reported on Monday, however, that there was an uprising among Republicans unhappy with Trump’s decision, noting they had “begun discussing whether they may have to vote to block President Trump’s planned new tariffs on Mexico.”

CNN reported on Monday that talks were still shaky, with “no clear path forward.” GOP senators were still considering legislative options.

“Republicans were considering the possibility that they may have to vote on the national emergency underlying Trump’s threatened tariffs on Mexican goods. The vote could block the tariffs and disrupt funds the President already co-opted for border security,” the outlet wrote. “While some senators have discussed options, it doesn’t mean there’s a serious effort underway to bring forward such a vote.”

There was also lingering reluctance to publicly rebuke Trump over the matter, the outlet wrote.

Trump on Tuesday pushed back against any potential threat from Congress by playing up his broader popularity among Republicans.

“I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating as of this morning in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record,” he claimed. “Can you believe that? Isn’t that something. I love records.”

The Mexico tariffs are the latest signal that Trump is not interested in withdrawing from his ongoing trade war, which has impacted U.S. farmers and businesses heavily. Despite concerns from legislators in his own party that the tariffs are hurting their constituents, Trump on Tuesday doubled down, using the so-called “crisis” along the southern border to push his unpopular trade policy.

“I want to see security at our border,” he said. “… Mexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country.”"
Elizabeth Warren Just Joined a Longtime Republican Cause,https://time.com,[],,,,https://time.com/5599941/elizabeth-warren-commerce-department/,"Republicans have long sought to scrap the U.S. Department of Commerce. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, longtime Rep. Ron Paul and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have all called for cutting or eliminating it, as have the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute.

You can now add Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the list.

In a Medium post published Tuesday morning, the Massachusetts Democrat outlined an economic agenda that includes “consolidating existing government programs that affect job creation” by replacing the Commerce Department with a new Department of Economic Development that aims to create and protect sustainable jobs.

The Commerce Department is an amorphous government body tasked with promoting job creation and economic growth. It houses the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Patent and Trademark Office and oversees miscellaneous governmental bodies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements.

Warren’s Department of Economic Development would absorb all trade-related programs and some of the business-related agencies under the existing Commerce Department. It would also compile a National Jobs Strategy every four years in order to identify new economic risks and opportunities, her Medium post says.

“It will focus not just on the overall American economy, but on regional economies. It will examine trends that have disproportionate effects on rural communities and smaller cities. And it will establish clear goals for American jobs and American industry that will guide how the Department of Economic Development prioritizes its investments and direct its programs,” Warren writes.

Unlike plans put forward by Cruz and Perry, who hoped to scale back the size of the federal government, Warren’s plan is focused more on increasing worker protections by grouping programs that help them under a single agency.

Former President Barack Obama presented a similar proposal back in 2012, when he tried to eliminate the Commerce Department in favor of a broader organization led by a Secretary of Business. That plan fizzled because it was “not a priority,” a former White House chief of staff told Politico at the time.

Warren’s economic agenda includes encouraging manufacturers to produce their goods in the United States by leveraging federal research dollars, investing $20 billion into apprenticeship programs for the next ten years, and requiring the federal government buy American-made products, whenever possible.

“If we can aggressively intervene in markets to protect the interests of the wealthy and well-connected,” she writes in the Medium post, “then we can damn well use all the tools at our disposal to protect the interests of American workers.”

Warren says she’ll expand on her broader economic patriotism plan — which includes establishing the Department of Economic Development — with specific issue-area proposals, on topics like the environment and trade, in the coming weeks.

The first of these specific proposals will also be announced Tuesday, ahead of campaign visits in Michigan and Indiana. The green manufacturing plan, as she calls it, would allocate $1.5 trillion toward purchasing American-made clean energy products for use and export, $400 billion toward researching clean energy development, and $100 billion toward creating a federal office that helps other countries buy and use American-made clean energy over the course of ten years.

A Moody’s Analytics cost-analysis report obtained by TIME indicates a substantial portion of this proposal’s costs would be offset by Warren’s plans to strengthen corporate tax rules and end federal oil and gas subsidies, though it estimates the 10-year budget deficit would still increase by about $100 billion.

Warren argues it’s worth the investment in a separate Medium post also out on Tuesday. “With big and bold investments in American research, American industry, and American workers, we can lead the global effort to combat climate change — and create more than a million good jobs here at home,” she writes.

Warren’s proposal to create the Department of Economic Development is not the first time she has sought to reshape the executive branch.

Back in 2007, Warren argued for the creation of a federal agency that would protect consumers from predatory financial practices. A couple years later, she played a major role in forging that idea into the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the 2008 financial collapse proved the industry required stricter regulations.

Two years ago, that bureau reported it had secured about $12 billion in relief for 29 million customers since it opened in 2011.

Corbyn had previously said it was wrong to ""roll out the red carpet"" for a President who ""uses racist and misogynistic rhetoric"", but did say he would ""welcome a meeting with President Trump to discuss all matters of interest"".

A spokesperson for May told reporters after the press conference that she and Trump had discussed a wide range of topics including climate change, foreign policy, and a future trade agreement.

The spokesperson said: “They began by talking about the economic partnership and the shared desire to do what you heard the president and the prime minister describe as a very ambitious trade agreement.

“They also talked about deepening the economic partnership between the two countries. I think it’s about close ties across the various different sectors of the economy.

“There’s a lot of focus on free trade agreements and the deal that you can do in relation to goods, but just about deepening economic ties.”

The spokesperson said they also discussed “a whole range of foreign policy areas”, including China, Syria, Daesh, Al-Quida, Yemen, and Iran.

“They talked about clean energy, they talked about climate change,” the spokesperson added.

The two leaders also talked about the Chinese Huawei communications network, whose potential input into Britain’s 5G network has been a sticking point between Trump and May.

The spokesperson said: “The PM set out that we have an ongoing review, a very serious piece of work, the PM stressed... her absolute commitment to national security.”

The spokesperson said “they had a good discussion and I think they both agreed both sides are treating this issue with the greatest seriousness.”"
Donald Trump UK State VisitL Did Queen Elizabeth Really Troll Trump?,https://www.vogue.com,['Michelle Ruiz'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.vogue.com/article/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-queen-elizabeth-trolling-shade,"There was something distinctly queasy about the feeling of watching the British royals fraternize with the Trump administration during Donald Trump's UK state visit—as well as, um, with the entire Trump family—at Monday night's banquet at Buckingham Palace. Duty calls and all, but as Labour party shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry astutely pointed out, ""I don't think that this President... deserves the honor"" of a state visit, given his displays of racism and misogyny, among other objectionable behaviors. Between that and the migrant children dying in detention centers, one wonders how anyone conjured an appetite for Windsor lamb.

Perhaps as a coping tactic in the face of this uncomfortable visit (notwithstanding Britain's own problematic colonial history, Kate Middleton should not have to talk to Steve Mnuchin in any setting), Internet theories swiftly emerged that Queen Elizabeth II was actually ""trolling"" Trump through her accessories, gift choices, and words.

First, onlookers pointed to the Queen's selection of the Burmese Ruby Tiara, which, according to the Royal Exhibitions, possesses ""prophylactic properties guarding the wearer not only against illness, but also against evil."" Then, late night cable show hosts seized on the fact that the 93-year-old monarch gifted Trump with a first edition copy of The Second World War, Winston Churchill’s Nobel-winning history tome. This registered as potential dig both because it's a book, and Trump has been accused of not liking to read, and because it's a book about a noted anti-fascist.

""Either she doesn't know Trump,"" Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show, ""or she's trolling him.""

Sparking further speculation were the Queen's comments at Monday night's banquet. ""As we face the new challenges of the 21st Century, the anniversary of D-Day reminds us all that our countries have achieved together,"" she said of the ""special relationship"" between the U.K. and the U.S. Some wishful thinkers, like political scientist David Rothkopf, interpreted the Queen's words as ""an extraordinary reproach,"" saying on Twitter that she was ""trolling Trump hard, with remarks underscoring the importance of the alliances and the international institutions Trump is working so hard to undermine and dismantle.""

Earlier on Monday, the prayer for both governments from Very Reverend Dr. John Hall, who greeted President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at Westminster Abbey, also came under close examination as a possible rebuke of Trump's character: ""Grant them as symbols of loyalty and unity for all their people; inspire their governments with vision, understanding and integrity."" Throw in that the Trumps, unlike the Obamas and Bushes before them, are not staying at Buckingham Palace, reportedly due to extensive, ongoing renovations, and we've got ourselves a rich conspiracy theory.

This elaborate revenge fantasy is satisfying, I admit. But the likelihood of Queen Elizabeth II actually ""savagely"" ""clapping back"" at the president of the United States through her tiara rubies while elaborately receiving him at her palace is probably quite slim. It is not, in fact, time to welcome her to the resistance, no matter how hard one wishes to try.

""With America being Great Britain’s number-one ally globally, the entire purpose and invitation for the state visit was to renew, strengthen and celebrate the relations. As the head of state, Queen Elizabeth would have only been showing respect through her actions, gifts and speech,"" said Myka Meier, founder of Beaumont Etiquette, and the creator of the famed Duchess Effect course on royal graces. ""While she is known to enjoy a bit of humor, Queen Elizabeth is known to be the greatest and most experienced diplomat in the world, and it is my belief that she never would have done anything to hinder her relationship with the president, no matter who it is, of the United States.""

For now, it's perhaps best to leave the winks and nods to Camilla."
"Donald Trump and Theresa May discuss climate change, Huawei and trade",https://www.newscientist.com,['Adam Vaughan'],,,,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205360-donald-trump-and-theresa-may-discuss-climate-change-huawei-and-trade/,"NEIL HALL/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock

US president Donald Trump had his first state visit to the UK this week. Amid the ceremony and speeches, he discussed trade, climate policy and cybersecurity with prime minister Theresa May.

High on the agenda was the UK-US trading relationship if the UK leaves the EU. “The US is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the UK and US,” Trump said at a press conference on 4 June. He added it could be up to three times the value of trade today, and any deal would include the National Health Service.

Two days earlier, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said in an interview that the deal would be “on the president’s desk day one the minute you leave”. But he raised hackles by saying farming and healthcare could be part of a deal.

For instance, in the US slaughtered chicken is washed in chlorine, and the import of these chickens is banned in the EU. Johnson said the UK wouldn’t necessarily have to accept chlorine-washed chicken, but reiterated his view that the practice is safe. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, sought to assuage concerns, saying the UK would keep control over regulation of the NHS and food standards for imports.

The US also used the visit to press its case for the UK to block Chinese technology firm Huawei from the country’s 5G networks. The US has previously claimed that Huawei’s involvement would threaten US-UK intelligence sharing, but Trump said such cooperation would not be at risk because “we are going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei”.

May said she raised with Trump the UK’s support for the Paris climate accord. Several hundred academics wrote to the prime minister before the visit, urging her to challenge Trump on his planned exit from the climate accord in 2020. While any request by May is likely to have fallen on deaf ears, raising the subject was an opportunity for the government to advertise its bid to host UN climate talks next year.

Opinion | Slouching Toward Impeachment,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Gail Collins', 'Bret Stephens']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/opinion/trump-impeachment-congress.html,"Bret: Wait, you don’t believe that Bill Weld has the G.O.P. nomination in the bag?

The surrender of the mainstream Republican Party to Trump will be a matter of political and even psychological analysis for decades to come. It is the transformation of a party into a cult. It is the triumph of hatred — of the left, of elites, of immigrants from s-hole countries — over principle. It is the collapse of moral judgment before the blandishments of political power.

What’s particularly remarkable is how thorough the collapse has been among the conservative intelligentsia. Right-wing intellectuals don’t go along with Trump despite his despicable personality; they do so, quite openly, because of it. They’ve concluded that he’s just the sort of blunt instrument they need to “own the libs.” And in a way they are right: Trump does make the left go nuts. It’s just that, in the process, he’s doing incalculable damage to our political culture.

Gail: I don’t buy into the theory that liberals are going into some kind of left-wing Trumpist tailspin. I’m old enough to remember the antiwar/student power/black power era of the ’60s and ’70s, when the left was way more radical, and the rhetoric was even more over the top than it is now.

But the yelling was filtered through the press. There was no Twitter or Facebook or blogging, so it was easier to ignore.

Bret: Key point.

Gail: Look at the Democratic presidential candidates. There’s a lot of competition for the populist vote, but very few of them are tossing out hate-the-right sound bites. Unless you consider calls for impeachment to be extreme. Which is hard to do, given that we discuss the possibility very seriously all the time.

Bret: I definitely don’t think calling for impeachment is extreme. I’ve called for it myself over his violations of campaign-finance laws, before thinking better of it. Then again, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado and long-shot presidential hopeful, got booed the other day by a Democratic audience in San Francisco for saying that socialism wasn’t the answer. There’s a made-for-TV moment for the Trump campaign. Other things that will help Trump: calls for slavery reparations, the Green New Deal, early prison release for violent felons.

Gail: Socialism gets a raw deal. I know people are afraid of it, but when you compare it with Trumpian capitalism, it looks pretty damned good."
U.S. moving toward major antitrust probe of tech giants,https://www.reuters.com,"['Diane Bartz', 'Min Read']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-technology-antitrust/us-moving-toward-major-antitrust-probe-of-tech-giants-idUSKCN1T42JH,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters on Monday, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world’s largest companies.

The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which enforce antitrust laws in the United States, have divided oversight over the four companies, two sources said, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department.

With jurisdiction established, the next step is for the two federal agencies to decide if they want to open formal investigations. Results are not likely to be quick. A previous FTC probe of Google took more than two years.

Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.

Shares of Facebook Inc fell 7.5% on Monday while Google’s owner Alphabet Inc shed more than 6%. Amazon.com Inc shares fell 4.6% and Apple Inc dipped 1%.

The Justice Department and FTC generally do not discuss investigations.

U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.

He has repeatedly criticized Amazon for taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service, also without evidence. Trump has frequently taken aim at Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who privately owns the Washington Post, a newspaper which often criticizes Trump.

LAWMAKERS WEIGH IN

Leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle welcomed potential investigations of big tech firms.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told Reuters that the business model of companies like Google and Facebook needs to be scrutinized. “It’s got so much power, and so unregulated,” he said. Another Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, said the panel would do what she called a “deeper dive” into big tech companies.

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that U.S. enforcers have to do more than wring their hands about the companies’ clout, also weighed in.

“Their predatory power grabs demand strict & stiff investigation & antitrust action,” the Connecticut senator wrote on Twitter.

Separately, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened its own investigation into competition in digital markets, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by tech giants.

News broke on Friday that the Justice Department was laying the groundwork to investigate Google to determine whether the world’s biggest online advertising platform was using its size to squeeze out smaller competitors, violating laws designed to ensure fair competition. The company declined comment on Monday.

The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Amazon would come under the remit of the FTC in any probe. Amazon declined comment on Monday.

People briefed on the matter say neither the Justice Department nor the FTC have contacted Google or Amazon about any probes, and that company executives are unaware of what issues regulators are reviewing.

Apple and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

While the four technology companies, all worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have drawn scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, it was not clear what the U.S. Justice Department or FTC planned to focus on.

Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, has been criticized for holding sway over third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself. Lawmakers have also argued that Amazon’s low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, many of whom have closed because they could not compete.

Apple is the subject of a European Union investigation into a complaint made by streaming music provider Spotify Technology SA that Apple abuses its power over app downloads. In 2014, the iPhone maker settled a Justice Department lawsuit alleging it conspired with publishers to raise the price of e-books.

The FTC has already been investigating Facebook’s sharing of data belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said in April that it expected to be fined up to $5 billion by the regulator.

Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has a huge influence in many countries and has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called ‘fake news’ on its service.

Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors.

The FTC settled an investigation of Google in 2013 with a reprimand. The company has been fined multiple times by the European Union’s competition regulator, most recently in March for 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) in a case focused on illegal practices in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.

Legal experts have said U.S. regulators are unlikely to attempt to break up the technology giants.

It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T being two of the biggest examples. U.S. antitrust probes more often result in an agreement to change certain business practices."
Trump's Tweeting Losing Its Impact? One Study Says Yes,https://www.outsidethebeltway.com,['Doug Mataconis'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/trumps-tweeting-losing-its-impact-one-study-says-yes/,"Trump’s Tweeting Losing Its Impact? One Study Says Yes

According to one new study, President Trump's tweets aren't having the same impact they used to.

Doug Mataconis · · 3 comments

However it ultimately ends, when the history of Donald Trump’s Presidency is written, there will likely be an entire chapter or two devoted to Twitter and the manner in which the President used that medium to communicate with supporters, spread his message, and attack opponents before he became a candidate, while he was running for the Presidency, and after he became President.

While the Obama Administration used Twitter and other social media outlets to communicate its message, Trump has been unique in his use of the medium to set the agenda. In the beginning, Trump’s Twitter account was used mainly to promote Trump, Trump-branded products, and his television shows The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice. At that point, the account appears to have been run by people working for Trump rather than himself. At some point in early 2011, though, Trump took over the account on his own and started using it to comment on politics and things he saw on television, as well as to attack celebrities with whom he was feuding such as Rosie O’Donnell. At some point, he also started using it to comment on politics and to spread his attacks on former President Obama, including his insistence during that period that the President was not born in the United States. The rest, as they say, is history.

Now, though, there’s increasing evidence that Trump’s Presidential tweeting may not be having the as big an impact as it used to:

resident Trump’s Twitter interaction rate fell significantly in the eight months following his election and declined further in 2019, according to an analysis of data by CrowdTangle reported by Axios Trump’s interaction rate, defined as retweets and likes per tweet divided by his number of followers, fell from 0.55 percent in November 2016 to 0.32 in June 2017, and was at 0.16 percent as of May 25. The Toronto Star’s Daniel Dale told Axios that many of Trump’s tweets contain rhetoric he has repeated too often to shock casual readers.

For example, Trump has tweeted “no collusion” 54 times since April 1, “no obstruction” 30 times, “witch hunt” 20 times and “treason” seven times, the news outlet noted on Sunday.

While Trump’s interactions per tweet have increased recently, his followers have grown by a much larger percentage, according to the analysis. He is also tweeting more often, meaning the interactions are spread out across more posts. Trump tweeted 157 times per month during the first six-month period analyzed, but 284 times per month over the last six months, Axios added.

Trump is on track to see his lowest month in almost 2 1/2 years for Twitter interaction rates in May, even as he closes in on his one-month record for tweets, not counting retweets, according to the analysis.

Despite the frequent headlines generated by combative or insulting tweets from Trump, apolitical tweets from the president have generated some of his highest interaction rates, according to the analysis. .

Part of the reason for the drop in Trump’s interaction rate may simply be due to the fact that he has far more Twitter followers how than he has in the past. At the moment, the President has roughly 60.7 million followers. Even assuming that some of them are not “real” accounts that’s still a heck of a lot of followers. It also means, though, that a measurement such as interaction that depends on the number of followers to be calculated is going to necessarily be impacted when the number of followers goes up. Nonetheless, it does appear that Trump’s tweets are having somewhat less of an impact, or at least that people are re-tweeting or responding to them at a lower rate than they used to.

It’s also worth noting that it’s likely that not all of the people who follow Trump are necessarily fans and supporters. It’s likely that nearly every political reporter out there follows him because keeping an eye on Presidential tweets and the impact they have on politics is, for better or worse, part of their job. Others seem to follow him out of a morbid sense of curiosity not unlike people who slow down when they pass the scene of an auto accident on the highway. Those people are unlikely to retweet or respond to the President’s ranting.

None of this is likely to mean that Trump is going to stop using Twitter any time soon. For better or worse, his Tweeting, which typically occurs either early in the morning or later at night, continues to drive news cycles and continues to be controversial. That’s likely only going to increase as we get closer to the 2020 election. Indeed, Trump has already started using his Twitter account to attack potential 2020 candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg. He has also used it, of course, to attack the Russia investigation in general and Special Counsel Robert Mueller in particular. The closer we get to 2020, the more likely it is that this will increase."
Trump Baby Blimp Flies in London as Protests Greet President,https://www.voanews.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-baby-blimp-flies-in-london-as-protests-greet-president/4945020.html,"Thousands of protesters greeted President Donald Trump's U.K. visit with anger and British irony Tuesday, crowding London's government district while the U.S. leader met Prime Minister Theresa May nearby.

Feminists, environmentalists, peace activists, trade unionists and others demonstrated against the lavish royal welcome being given to a president they see as a danger to the world, chanting ""Say it loud, say it clear, Donald Trump's not welcome here.""

""I'm very cross he's here,"" said guitar teacher Sarah Greene, carrying a home-made sign reading ""keep your grabby hands off our national treasures"" under a picture of one of Queen Elizabeth II's corgis.

""I find him scary. My sign is flippant and doesn't say the things I'd really like to say.""

A day of protests began with the flying of a giant blimp depicting the president as an angry orange baby, which rose from the grass of central London's Parliament Square.

One group came dressed in the red cloaks and bonnets of characters from Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which is set in a dystopian, misogynist future America.

Demonstrators filled Trafalgar Square and spilled down Whitehall, a street lined with imposing government offices.

Many paused to photograph a robotic likeness of Trump sitting on a golden toilet, cell phone in hand. The robot caught the attention of passers-by with its recitation of catchphrases including ""No collusion"" and ""You are fake news.""

""It's 16 feet high, so it's as large as his ego,"" said Don Lessem from Philadelphia, who built the statue from foam over an iron frame and had it shipped by boat across the Atlantic.

Lessem, a dinosaur expert who makes models of prehistoric creatures, said ""I'm interested in things that are big, not very intelligent and have lost their place in history.""

""I wanted people here to know that people in America do not support Trump in the majority . and humor is my weapon,"" he said.

Watch: Jamie Dettmer video

Leaders of Britain's main opposition party joined demonstrators later at the rally, just up the street from May's Downing St. office. Police have erected barricades to stop protesters marching past the gates of Downing St.

Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who declined an invitation to Monday's royal banquet for the president, was due to address the protest.

Emily Thornberry, Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman, said Trump was ""a sexual predator"" and a racist who did not deserve the honor of a state visit hosted by Queen Elizabeth II.

Thornberry told the BBC that the leader of Britain's most important ally should be stood up to ""the way you deal with a bully"" because ""if you bow down in front of them you just get kicked harder.""

Not everyone in London was unwelcoming.

Lewis Metcalfe said he came to the city from his home in northern England to show support for the president.

""I'm obviously going to be a minority today,"" said Metcalfe, who wore a ""Make America Great Again"" cap. ""I don't agree with all his policies. He's not the greatest president in the world, but he does get things done.""

Trump dined with the queen at Buckingham Palace and took tea with Prince Charles on Monday, the first day of his three-day visit.

Things are likely to become more awkward on Tuesday when he meets May, who is in the final weeks of her premiership. The two leaders have sharply differing views on issues including Iran, Brexit and Chinese telecoms firm Huawei.

Trump has already criticized May's handling of Brexit and said May's rival Boris Johnson would make an ""excellent"" prime minister."
Donald Trump’s state visit is a sorry sign of the times for the UK,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1634626/donald-trumps-state-visit-is-a-sorry-sign-of-the-times-for-the-uk/,"Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK was offered with exceptional speed, from a position of weakness. Delayed once, through presidential pique, Trump has now arrived in the UK. But greater than the usual preoccupation with the “special” relationship is the question of whether there is now even a settled relationship.

Given that the experiences of presidents and prime ministers derive from both structural alliance and individual contingency, can the relationship withstand a president whose very appeal has been eschewing conventions, legacy ties, and alliances? In an age of new normals, there may be need for new norms.

Some previous relationships worked because of a similarity of outlook. This was true for Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, and for Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. Others worked through a chemistry, be it personal or generational or a combination, such as John F. Kennedy’s and Harold Macmillan’s, Jimmy Carter’s and James Callaghan’s, and Barack Obama’s and David Cameron’s. Some worked, forged as they were by war, notably Franklin D. Roosevelt’s and Winston Churchill’s, and George W Bush’s and Tony Blair’s. Some did not work—such as Harold Wilson’s and Lyndon Johnson’s, and Bill Clinton’s and John Major’s. But no president and prime minister have been as dissimilar and as incompatible as Donald Trump and Theresa May.

An unusual relationship

Even when there had, in the past, been disagreements there were always trammels: diplomatic language; due process. This president behaves with too little, this prime minister too much, restraint. Fitting neatly with her unmanageable Brexit inheritance, from the moment Trump won the election, May faced an unenviable choice.

She could either defy popular opinion to strategically embrace an international pariah or, opt for the more popular tactic of shunning him. As it turned out, he was literally to embrace her.

However implausible their pairing, Trump and May were bound by a similarity of circumstance. As with the “right turn” of the 1980s, and the “third way” of the millennium, they found themselves in office at the same time and as a consequence of respective national iterations of the same phenomenon.

Reuters/Peter Nicholls An unusual relationship.

The shock results of the EU referendum and the US presidential election occurred five months apart and shared many of the same characteristics and many of the same characters. But while the president has brilliantly channeled and exploited the public sentiment that propelled him to power, the prime minister has been far less convincing.

May had come to office by the very virtue of not having taken a stand on the great issue of the day; he had been elemental to it. Both countries were sharply divided. In the UK more than at any time without war all other matters were subsumed in one all-consuming and often traumatic national debate; in the US the president was the debate.

Insofar as each was a beneficiary of exceptional circumstances there was at least the possibility of mutual utility on which to base special relations. But this was a prime minister who, more than any other, had circumscribed herself, by having quite unnecessarily called, and effectively lost, a general election she had confidently expected to win convincingly. Her already subordinate position was weakened further.

Of the greatest political challenge to Britain in peacetime, the president, claimed paternity (“They will soon be calling me Mr Brexit!”) and was keen to demonstrate shared endeavor: “They took their country back, just like we will take America back.”

Brexit meant that trade would complement security and intelligence as the cement of the special relationship. But it also meant there was an opportunity for Trump to leverage the UK: he would be working with a prime minister with an even greater imperative than usual to establish a close connection with the US.

A sign of the times

Some have still to adapt to the new norms. The BBC recently regarded Trump’s undermining of May as “a highly unusual intervention,” but it was no longer unusual. Before his first visit in 2018 he lauded her most likely and active usurper (as he has since). Then, once he had arrived, while standing next to her, he questioned her Brexit policy (as he has subsequently).

The publicly stated grounds for the president effectively endorsing one of the candidates to replace May, are suitably narcissistic: “I have a lot of respect for Boris [Johnson]. He obviously likes me, and says very good things about me.” There is more to it than that: the broader commonalities behind Brexit and Trump.

Brexit also connects Trump and Nigel Farage. In an early transgression, Trump advocated the latter as the next UK ambassador to the US. In the latest, he promoted Farage as Brexit negotiator and plans to meet with him during this visit, contrary to the wishes of the host government. Even a bilateral meeting with the prime minister appears to have been cancelled. It is less that protocols have been breached than it not being clear if there are any protocols left.

This is a state visit offered in haste and regretted at leisure. To cap it, no prime minister has had to ensure the humiliation of knowing in advance that a presidential visit is the end of their premiership. Misleading as it may be to overly personalize this moment, it’s hard not to. The unprecedented challenges of 2016 have been faced, by common accord, by the one being unsuited, and the other unfit, for the offices they hold.

In another age, interventions by a foreign head of even a friendly government in another country’s domestic affairs would widely be regarded as intolerable. It is a measure of our age and Britain’s predicament that tolerated they will be.

Updated at 11:45 a.m. ET

President Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May discussed Brexit, business ties and the relationship between the U.S. and U.K. during a summit Tuesday, marking something of a final hurrah for May, who is resigning on Friday after failing to secure a Brexit deal.

Trump called the relationship between the U.S. and U.K. ""the greatest alliance the world has ever known."" At a news conference, Trump also praised the men who want to succeed May as prime minister.

While Trump's arrival Monday was marked by ceremony and spectacle, he and May focused on the road ahead, as the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union. In the past, the thorny Brexit issue has fueled awkward interactions between Trump and May: Last summer, Trump sharply criticized May's failure to make a deal, saying she hadn't listened to his advice.

At the time, Trump also said May's top Conservative rival, Boris Johnson, would ""make a great prime minister."" And he repeated that sentiment Tuesday.

In a joint news conference at the U.K. Foreign Office, May reiterated that she believes the EU exit plan her government has negotiated is a good deal. As for whether she should have taken Trump's advice, she recalled that he had suggested she sue the EU — and she said that by not taking that step, she had landed a good deal.

""I would have sued, but that's OK,"" Trump said, shrugging his shoulders as the audience chuckled.

Saying May is probably a better negotiator than him, Trump said a Brexit deal is ""teed up."" Turning to May, he added, ""Perhaps you won't be given the credit that you deserve, if they do something. But I think you deserve a lot of credit. I really do.""

Trump said he had correctly predicted the outcome of the U.K.'s watershed 2016 vote to leave the EU. He later added, ""I think it will happen, and I believe the prime minister has brought it to a really good point, where something will take place in the not-too-distant future.""

Another question for Trump touched on a phone call he had with Boris Johnson during this state visit. Media outlets have reported that Trump sought a meeting with Johnson — who said he was tied up with other matters.

""I know Boris. I like him, I've liked him for a long time. He's — I think he would do a very good job.""

Acknowledging one of Johnson's rivals for the post, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in the front row, Trump continued, ""I know Jeremy, I think he'd do a very good job.""

As for Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Trump said, ""I don't know Michael. But — would he do a good job, Jeremy? Tell me,"" he said, as the audience laughed.

The first question of the news conference touched on London Mayor Sadiq Khan — who reignited his feud with Trump on Sunday, in an essay criticizing the U.S. president. Trump responded by calling Khan a ""stone cold loser.""

""He should be positive, not negative,"" Trump said of Khan. ""He's a negative force, not a positive force.""

Trump was also asked about Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party who spoke out against Trump during a large protest in Trafalgar Square.

""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" Trump said of Corbyn. He added, ""I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think that people should look to do things correctly, as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done.""

Standing alongside May, Trump was also asked about the U.S. threat to withhold intelligence from any allies who use the Chinese electronics giant Huawei to build their 5G networks — and if the U.S. is prepared to keep some secrets away from its British allies.

""No, because we're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship,"" Trump said. There would be ""absolutely no limitations,"" he added.

Trump also said he hadn't seen the street protests against his visit, saying that instead of angry demonstrators and signs, he had seen thousands of people cheering, including some who waved American flags.

""I didn't see the protests until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So, it was fake news.""

Down the street from the prime minister's compound, protesters had gathered to demonstrate against the U.S. president's policies, climate change, the complicated mess of Brexit — or some combination of all of the above. As happened during Trump's visit last summer, the demonstration included a small blimp depicting Trump as a baby.

After the news conference, the Trumps and Mays left to visit the Churchill War Rooms. On Tuesday night, the Trumps will host a dinner at Winfield House, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where the guests of honor will include Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, Duchess of Cornwall.

In addition to a lunchtime visit to the prime minister's official residence, the two leaders held a larger discussion at St James's Palace in London, with Ivanka Trump and other administration officials sharing a large table with the CEOs of large British companies such as Barclays and the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.

""I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal,"" Trump said. ""It'll be a very fair deal, and I think that this is something that your folks want to do, my folks want to do, and we want to do, and we're going to get it done.""

Opening the meeting, May emphasized the substantial business relationship between the U.S. and U.K.

""Our trade between our nations last year worth almost $240 billion,"" May said. She later added, ""British companies employ a million citizens in the U.S. And every morning, a million people here in the U.K. go to work for American companies.""

May also noted that many world leaders are converging on the U.K. this week, as part of celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the Allies' pivotal D-Day invasion of World War II. Trump will take part in a D-Day ceremony in Portsmouth, England, on Wednesday, before flying to France for a brief visit with French President Emmanuel Macron.

The U.S.-U.K. summit comes just three days before May is slated to leave office, having announced her resignation last month. In an apparent nod to her exit, Trump praised her on Tuesday.

""I'd just like to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job on behalf of the people of the United States and it's an honor to have worked with you,"" Trump told May. ""I don't know exactly what your timing is, but stick around. Let's do this deal, OK?""

First lady Melania Trump accompanied the president on the short trip from the palace discussion to 10 Downing Street, where a red carpet was rolled out to greet them.

The Trumps posed for photos with May and her husband, Philip, before going on a tour of the famous residence. At one point, the two world leaders paused to look at a copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, from the time of the former British colony's national founding.

""It's a fascinating document, we think it has been in the U.K. for about 200 years,"" May said, according to a pool report."
