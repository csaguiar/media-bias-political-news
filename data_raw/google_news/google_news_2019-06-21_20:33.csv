E. Jean Carroll: “Trump attacked me in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman.”,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],06-21-2019,2019,6,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/president-donald-trump-faces-new-rape-accusation.html,"Photograph by Amanda Demme for New York Magazine. Photo: New York Magazine

The cover story New York published today details an encounter the writer E. Jean Carroll had over two decades ago with Donald J. Trump, in which the then–real-estate mogul allegedly assaulted her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in midtown Manhattan.

The episode is one of six incidents Carroll details in the article of attacks on her by men over the course of her life. Another episode involves the disgraced former CEO of CBS, Les Moonves. The cover story is an excerpt from her newest book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, which will be published on July 2 by St. Martin’s Press.

When Carroll meets Donald Trump in Bergdorf Goodman, the encounter starts as a friendly one. Trump recognizes her as “that advice lady”; Carroll recognizes him as “that real-estate tycoon.” Trump tells Carroll that he’s there to buy a gift for “a girl,” and though we don’t learn the identity of this mystery woman, Carroll places the ensuing incident in late 1995 or early 1996, during which time Trump was married to Marla Maples. When Trump asks Carroll to advise him on what to buy, she agrees, and the two eventually make their way to the lingerie section. Trump suggests a lace bodysuit and encourages Carroll to try it on; she, deflecting, jokingly suggests that he try it on instead. After they reach the dressing rooms, events turn violent. In Carroll’s account, Trump shoves her against a wall inside a dressing room, pulls down her tights, and, “forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway — or completely, I’m not certain — inside me.”

Carroll, 75, is a venerated Elle advice columnist. At the time of the attack, she was well known in her own right. A frequent feature writer for magazines like Playboy and Esquire, she had her own television show on America’s Talking, the precursor to MSNBC. Trump had his own record. By the time of his alleged assault on Carroll, Trump’s ex-wife, Ivana, had already claimed that Trump violated her during their marriage. (Ivana recanted the claim after Trump launched his campaign for the presidency.) Further news reports, published in 2016, place at least four other alleged sexual-assault claims, made by Kristin Anderson, Jill Harth, Cathy Heller, and Temple Taggart McDowell, in the years before and during the time period of Carroll’s account.

Carroll is now at least the 16th woman to accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct and the 14th to accuse Moonves of similar offenses. The incidents, which date from the 1990s, are highly specific and related with dark humor. Moonves is compared by Carroll to an octopus, and Trump, she writes, “yammers about himself like he’s Alexander the Great ready to loot Babylon.” But she is clear, sometimes clinical, about the violence she experienced. Moonves frantically kisses and gropes her in a hotel elevator moments after she finished interviewing him for an article. The Trump story is even darker.

Carroll says that she disclosed the Trump incident to two friends at the time. One, whom Carroll describes as “a journalist, magazine writer, correspondent on the TV morning shows, author of many books, etc.,” told her to go to the police: “‘He raped you,’ she kept repeating when I called her. ‘He raped you. Go to the police! I’ll go with you. We’ll go together.’” The other, who is also a journalist, was sympathetically cautious: “‘Tell no one. Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He’ll bury you.’” Carroll writes that the Donna Karan coat-dress she wore that day “still hangs on the back of my closet door.” She wore it for the first time since the attack for her portrait session with New York for the cover, above.

New York has verified that Carroll did disclose the attack to these friends at the time, and has confirmed that Bergdorf Goodman kept no security footage that would prove or disprove Carroll’s story. New York has also sought comment from Moonves and Trump. Through his representative, Moonves told New York that he “emphatically denies” the incident occurred. A senior White House official said in a statement, “This is a completely false and unrealistic story surfacing 25 years after allegedly taking place and was created simply to make the President look bad.”

As for why Carroll has come forward only now, she writes that she dreaded the public humiliation that awaits her. “Receiving death threats, being driven from my home, being dismissed, being dragged through the mud,” she writes, “and joining the 15 women who’ve come forward with credible stories about how the man grabbed, badgered, belittled, mauled, molested, and assaulted them, only to see the man turn it around, deny, threaten, and attack them, never sounded like much fun.”

Trump threatened Time journalist with prison over Kim Jong Un letter,https://www.cnn.com,"['Brian Stelter', 'Cnn Business']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/media/time-photographer-trump-threat/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) President Trump's interview with a team of reporters from Time magazine took a sudden turn when he made a comment about prison time for a journalist.

The exchange happened in the Oval Office on Monday. Time published the interview transcript on Thursday evening, and that's when the comment started to get attention.

Here's the background: Trump showed the four reporters a letter that he said was ""written by Kim Jong Un. It was delivered to me yesterday. By hand."" Then he asked to go off-the-record, so that he could make comments that would not be reported or included in the transcript.

A Time journalist who was in the room evidently tried to take a photo of the letter's contents — and when the interview was back on the record, press secretary Sarah Sanders said, ""You can't take a picture of that, sorry.""

Later in the interview, the Time team brought up the fact that Trump tried to ""limit Mueller's Russia probe to only future election meddling."" One of the reporters (the transcript doesn't say who) noted that Trump dictated a letter to a former aide, Corey Lewandowski, ""telling him to tell"" former attorney general Jeff Sessions ""to limit the investigation."" The details were included in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Conway seemed flabbergasted that Trump didn't receive a casualty assessment earlier in the planning process, saying that it was unclear if he did because Trump ""lies about everything.""

Conway has been an outspoken critic of the president during his term -- especially at the beginning of 2019 -- despite the fact that his wife works in the Whtie House and managed Trump's 2016 campaign. In March, Trump hit back at Conway, describing him as ""VERY jealous of his wife's success.""

""George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted.

What if Trump won’t accept 2020 defeat?,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Darren Samuelsohn']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/trump-election-2020-1374589,"On Twitter last weekend, President Donald Trump pondered, “do you think the people would demand that I stay longer?” | Evan Vucci/AP Photo white house What if Trump won’t accept 2020 defeat? The situations all seem far-fetched, but the president's comments have people chattering in the halls of Congress and throughout the Beltway.

In 2016, Donald Trump waffled over whether he would accept the election results if he lost.

Since then, Trump has repeatedly joked about staying in office beyond the two terms the Constitution allows. Jerry Falwell Jr., Trump’s most prominent evangelical supporter, has suggested Trump should get two years tacked on to his first term as “pay back” for the Mueller investigation. The president’s own former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has warned that “there will never be a peaceful transition of power” should Trump fail in his reelection bid.

The scenarios all seem far-fetched — “It’s almost a question for science fiction movies,” cracked a former top Secret Service official — but the constant drumbeat nonetheless has people chattering in the halls of Congress and throughout the Beltway: What if Trump won’t accept defeat in 2020?

And one scenario in particular has Democrats nervous: the lawsuit-happy Trump contests the election results in court.

“It’s been a worry in the back of my mind for the last couple years now,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat. California Rep. Ted Lieu, a frequent Trump critic and early impeachment inquiry supporter, acknowledged the same concern but said he trusted law enforcement “would do the right thing” and “install the winner” of the election. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has told her party to prepare for the possibility that Trump contests the 2020 results.

Constitutional experts and top Republican lawmakers dismiss the fears as nonsense, noting there are too many forces working against a sitting president simply clinging to power — including history, law and political pressure.

“That is the least concern people should have. Of all the silly things that are being said, that may be the silliest,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who presided over the 2016 inauguration ceremony and expects to do so again in 2020. “The one thing we are really good at is the transition of power.”

Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley said a lingering incumbent would simply become irrelevant once the new and duly elected president is sworn in. At that point, the defeated president is nothing more than a guest, “if not an interloper,” in the White House, the George Washington University professor noted.

“The system would make fast work on any president who attempted to deny the results of the election,” he said.

But a court battle over a presidential election is not unprecedented. And Trump has shown a willingness to tie up his disputes in winding litigation. The Democratic National Committee and Trump’s campaign were in court all the way up to Election Day 2016, fighting over charges of voter intimidation and ballot access.

“All candidates have a right to contest results in federal court,” Turley said. “It’s not up to the candidate to decide if an election is valid. It’s not based on their satisfaction or consent. They have every right to seek judicial review.”

Even so, contesting the results of the election in more than one state would be “a massive undertaking,” said Bradley Shrager, a lawyer specializing in election litigation who has worked with several Democratic campaigns. He added that “given the time frames to launch recounts and election contests, you’d have to be preparing months in advance to be able to do that.”

There are also deadlines for submitting an official electoral vote tally, Shrager said, so a legal battle wouldn’t drag out indefinitely.

Still, Pelosi’s comments nodded to the Democratic suspicion that Trump will put up a fight. She argued the Democrats’ must win by a margin so “big” that Trump can’t challenge the results.

The sentiment, Democrats say, is fueled by Trump’s cavalier attitude toward presidential term lengths.

Trump continues to talk up the prospect that he could serve past the constitutionally mandated period. On Twitter last weekend, Trump pondered, “do you think the people would demand that I stay longer?” The line mirrored language he used at a rally in Pennsylvania last month where he talked about living in the White House for 20 years.

“We ran one time and we’re 1-and-0. But it was for the big one. Now we’re going to have a second time. And we’re going to have another one. And then we’ll drive them crazy,” Trump said. “And maybe if we really like it a lot — and if things keep going like they’re going — we’ll go and we’ll do what we have to do. We’ll do a three and a four and a five.”

Trump also promoted Falwell Jr.’s line from May that the president should get two extra years “as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup”, retweeting the Liberty University president.

After the best week ever for @realDonaldTrump - no obstruction, no collusion, NYT admits @BarackObama did spy on his campaign, & the economy is soaring. I now support reparations-Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup — Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 5, 2019

The president has long casually toyed with the idea that he could stay in office beyond the constitutionally set maximum.

In March 2018, Trump praised the ruling Communist Party of China for abolishing presidential term limits. Then, a month later, he publicly pondered why he couldn’t be in office for 16 years, an apparent reference to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died during his fourth term. The 22nd Amendment, ratified a few years after Roosevelt’s death, prohibited future presidents from serving more than two consecutive elected terms.

It’s not just talk of extending term limits that have raised questions about the president’s respect for the next cycle. During the 2016 campaign, Trump stoked fears among his supporters that the election would be “rigged” and he refused to state during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that he’d concede to his Democratic opponent if she won.

His crusade extended into Election Day when, just before 5 p.m., Trump incorrectly tweeted that “Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.” In fact, the problems were just in one county. And even after being declared the 2016 winner, Trump continued to state without evidence that “millions” of people voted illegally, fueling questions about whether he would have taken this argument to court if the result hadn’t gone his way.

When asked whether Trump would commit to conceding the 2020 election if he lost, the Trump reelection campaign turned the issue back on Democrats. It was Stacey Abrams, the rising Democratic star, who actually refused to concede defeat in her bid for the Georgia governorship, an aide noted.

“This question would be better asked of Stacey Abrams, who still refuses to accept that she lost the governor’s race in Georgia, or Hillary Clinton, for that matter, who still whines that her coronation was stolen,” the aide told POLITICO. “It’s also irrelevant, because President Trump will be re-elected in 2020.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The stakes for Trump in 2020 are high. If he loses, the president will lose his immunity from criminal prosecution the moment his successor is sworn into the White House. And several Democratic presidential hopefuls have suggested their Justice Department would be hard-pressed not to bring charges against Trump for obstructing justice, using the evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report. Federal prosecutors in New York have also been reviewing potential campaign finance violations.

Confronted with Trump’s past remarks, Republicans remain largely unmoved.

“As untraditional a president as he is, I think he understands if you lose an election you lose an election and the other person wins,” said Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot, a senior member of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. “There’s no chance of anything like that possibly happening. That’s just hysteria. No way would that ever happen.”

Chabot recalled getting similar questions about President Barack Obama holding on to power — serving more than two terms — before the 2016 election. “I didn’t want to laugh it off because these were my constituents. But I’d explain to them there’s no chance of that happening,” he said.

Unlike Obama, though, Trump has fanned the concerns with his rhetoric. He could also put all the scuttlebutt to rest if he wanted to, said John Q. Barrett, a St. John’s University law professor.

“He’s to blame at least in the minimal sense that he doesn’t shoot this down and say all the unequivocal, constitutionally obedient stuff that any president would say,” said Barrett, who served as an associate under Reagan-era independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. “Trump could pour a bucket of water on all this right away.”

The GOP may not take the idea seriously now. But they would be key to convincing Trump to concede in 2020 should the president resist an Electoral College loss, said Steven Levitsky, a comparative political scientist and professor of government at Harvard.

“No matter what the actual mechanisms are (which laws, which police), the key here is the Republican Party,” he said in an email.

The onus, Levitsky said, would fall to GOP leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to “come out and say, ‘Enough is enough, Trump lost.’”

Republicans to date have often given Trump the benefit of the doubt on controversial statements and actions. But Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said he is confident that even a GOP that has embraced all-things Trump would rebuke a lame duck Trump if he refused to respect the election results.

“Even my Republican colleagues, who are not willing to impeach, have said to me that they would not stand for a president defying a court-certified election result, nor would they stand for a president running for more than two terms,” he said.

Khanna added that he was more concerned with the integrity of the election itself, and “the shenanigans that could happen in the counting of the votes in these states.”

“It’s important to make sure that we have strong election protection lawyers in polling places around the country to prevent further interference, and verification on election night of each state’s results as they come in,” he said.

Despite giving assurances Trump would not cause problems if he lost, lawmakers can’t help but recall the most recent contested presidential election as an example of a close race that could become a model for an upside down 2020 race.

“I feel quite confident that whoever wins the next election will be president,” Chabot said. “Now, of course, that being said, then you have the 2000 Bush-Gore election. That was nuts.”"

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

The U.S. State Department Has 'Not Seen an Uptick' of Deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://people.com,['Steve Helling'],,,,https://people.com/crime/state-department-no-updick-deaths-dominican-republic/,"By now, the news is everywhere.

In the past year, according to the U.S. State Department, at least eight American tourists have died after falling ill in Dominican Republic resorts — and dozens more have gotten sick. The incidents have garnered widespread media coverage, causing many Americans to rethink their travel plans.

But despite the rash of illnesses, the U.S. State Department has not issued an elevated travel advisory for the island nation — and the agency says in a statement that they “have not seen an uptick” in deaths despite the media coverage.

“We are closely monitoring ongoing investigations by Dominican authorities into several recent deaths of U.S. citizens in the Dominican Republic,” the statement says. “We have no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad.”

“Millions of Americans travel to the Dominican Republic every year,” the statement continues. “Speaking generally, we have not seen an uptick in the number of US citizen deaths reported to the Department. While the overwhelming majority travel without incident, we want to assure all Americans that we continue to work actively with the Dominican authorities at the very highest levels to ensure that U.S. citizens are safe and feel safe while in the Dominican Republic.”

In April 2019, the department rated the Dominican Republic a level 2 for safety on a scale where 1 is the safest and 4 is the most dangerous. The rating means visitors should “exercise increased caution due to crime.” In the weeks of intense media scrutiny following the deaths of Americans, there has been no change to the rating.

The FBI has agents in on the island and are investigating the deaths of at least six of the tourists who have died since the summer of 2018. Some of them passed away in what appear to be bizarre — and similar — circumstances. The agencies are not yet releasing further details about the investigations.

Robin Bernstein, the ambassador of the United States to the Dominican Republic, told Univision these high-profile incidents should not be considered anything more than isolated cases. “We have 2.7 million Americans who come to the country and the statistics is that this is a very … unique event,” Bernstein said in a statement. “They come to visit the beautiful beaches and enjoy the great culture. Unfortunately sometimes those things happen to people.”

A spokesperson at the U.S. State Department tells PEOPLE that they will continue to monitor the situation, and will issue an elevated warning “if and when necessary.”"
Justice Department files antitrust suit to stop massive acquisition by Quad/Graphics,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Rick Romell', 'Published A.M. Ct June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2019/06/21/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-stop-big-quad-graphics-acquisition/1519957001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block Quad/Graphics Inc.'s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of LSC Communications, saying the merger would combine the only two significant magazine, catalog and book printers in the country.

""LSC is Quad’s primary competitor,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The two companies are by far the largest printers in the U.S. and their ""intense, head-to-head competition"" has benefited customers, the department said.

Sussex-based Quad, one of the largest private employers in Wisconsin, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the proposed acquisition. The firm said the Justice Department is ignoring ""dynamic conditions"" in commercial printing and the fact that printers compete not just with each other but with burgeoning digital advertising channels such as Google and Facebook.

""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels,"" printers have pursued consolidations to reduce overcapacity and battle more effectively with digital competitors, Quad said in a statement.

Neither Quad nor LSC has been a stellar performer of late. LSC lost money in two of the last three years. Over that same period, Quad netted 1.5% on its sales and saw revenue decline.

Both, though, are large companies, with dozens of manufacturing and distribution plants and tens of thousands of workers.

Quad as of December had the equivalent of 20,600 employees, including 8,000 in Wisconsin and 16,900 across the U.S. Sales last year hit $4.2 billion.

Chicago-based LSC was created in 2016 when RR Donnelley & Sons Co. spun off the wing of its business that concentrated on printing magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books.

LSC employed 22,000 people as of December, including 18,700 in the U.S. Its 2018 sales totaled $3.8 billion.

In an interview last fall, Joel Quadracci, Quad's chairman, president and CEO, said the acquisition of LSC would give Quad the scale and cash-generating capacity to smooth its transition toward becoming not just a printer but ""more of a marketing services partner"" to its customers.

""This is a defining moment in Quad’s 47-year journey,"" Quadracci said.

Sprinkled throughout the Justice Department's complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Chicago, are examples of how the government says intense competition between Quad and LSC has benefited customers.

When the two printing giants dueled for a contract with a major book publisher, the government alleges, one LSC executive, likening the competition to the Battle of Gettysburg, declared, ""We must win"" — only to see Quad scoop up the account by offering the publisher a deal that would save it $37 million over its current arrangement.

In another case, the complaint says, Quad tried to keep a magazine publisher from switching to LSC by offering a 25% price cut. But when the publisher told LSC of the ""Godfather deal"" Quad had offered, LSC responded with even better terms. It won the contract, and the publisher realized $6.5 million in immediate benefits, the complaint says.

Such episodes, the government alleges, demonstrate why LSC's chief executive told investors a merger with Quad could lead to ""pricing stability"" and eliminate such battles between the companies.

According to the complaint, Quad and LSC control a high percentage of web offset presses in the U.S. and all rotogravure presses — the types of equipment publishers turn to for printing long runs of magazines.

Meanwhile, the government said, a presentation by Quad's board of directors described catalog printing as a ""two-horse race between LSC and Quad, with the two firms holding a combined 69% share of that market.

In a statement, Quadracci said merging with LSC would help ensure print's viability as a channel for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook,"" Quadracci said. ""The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

The government, for its part, said in its complaint that people will continue to demand printed magazines, catalogs and books. Because of that, a digital-only platform is not an effective substitute to print for many publishers, the complaint said.

Reparations Won’t Start With Congress. A President Needs to Do That.,https://www.politico.com,['Theodore R. Johnson'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/21/reparations-hearing-2020-candidates-congress-227194,"Theodore R. Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.

On Wednesday, exactly 154 years after a promise was made to newly freed black Americans, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties convened a hearing to discuss reparations for the breaking of that promise. The date of the hearing marked Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the abolition of slavery and the associated “absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property” that were to follow. The denial of those equal rights, however, led to massive racial inequalities that still plague the United States.

At the center of the hearing was H.R. 40, a bill that’s been introduced in every Congress for the past three decades that “establishes a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations” for slavery, Jim Crow and their lingering effects. The bill represents one of the most serious efforts to jump-start a national inquiry into reparations, an idea that emerged with new urgency after Ta-Nehisi Coates’16,000-word Atlantic article in 2014 on the issue. Though 80 percent of white people still oppose reparations, their support has doubled, from 6 percent in 2014 to 13 percent today, since the publication of that essay.

Story Continued Below

For all the attention the congressional hearing got this week, Congress is the wrong venue if America is really going to move forward with a reparations study. It’s highly unlikely such a contentious measure would ever make it through the House or the Senate, assuming either would even put it to a vote. Instead, the push is going to have to come from the White House.

Though it won’t happen in the Trump administration, this idea is no longer as outlandish as it once might have seemed. The United States is now heading into its first presidential campaign where several candidates have expressed their support for studying reparations for the descendants of enslaved black Americans. The White House has unique power to focus national attention, and a presidential commission—far more than the congressional commission discussed this week—would have the prestige and traction to pull in national leaders and shape public opinion.

To date, of the 2020 Democratic candidates, only Julián Castro has specifically said he would create a commission to study the issue, but most of the top candidates ranging from Elizabeth Warren to Kamala Harris to Cory Booker have expressed support for the idea in some form. Many of them have expressed support for H.R. 40 and the congressional commission specifically. But executive action on reparations is an issue that each candidate should address more specifically. The creation of a presidential commission for a hot-button issue like reparations is well within the range of what presidents have done: Throughout the 20th century, presidential commissions and similar entities exploring a range of issues became a mainstay of American governance. From 1901 to 1929 alone, nearly 500 such commissions, councils, committees, task forces and the like were created by just five presidents. And the pace continues with modern presidents. Just last year, President Donald Trump announced two new commissions in the span of three days—one on school shootings and another on prisoner reentry.

On a controversial issue like reparations, it should be the president who steps up to the plate and commissions a study because state actions like making official apologies and reparations should ultimately be led by heads of state.

Presidential action is also necessary because it’s the surest route to a study, and such a study might be the only viable first step in the process because it could grease the wheels for a more productive national discussion on the issue. And on a controversial issue like reparations, improving the terms of the debate is essential to moving forward.

In a recent paper, political scientists David Miller and Andrew Reeves found that presidential commissions can be successful in accomplishing a range of political objectives—allaying constituents’ demands, incorporating diverse perspectives and fostering consensus, conferring credibility on policy ideas and proposals and providing a public framing for the issue in question that provides a point of reference for the national discourse. These benefits are particularly useful for the reparations debate, because too much of it is dominated by caricatured views that distort the issue. A reparations study could make the issues of racial inequality and embedded racial disadvantages plain by documenting their origins, entrenchment and present impacts.

In particular, the study can drill into some of the most controversial parts of the reparations debate: its focus on cash payments and its narrative framing that pits citizens against one another. Figures from economists on the cost of a reparations package range as high as $8 trillion to $14 trillion, making the $500 million proposed by presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, the only candidate to explicitly argue for direct cash payments, seem paltry. A study can give voters a real idea of what that figure might look like. And too many Americans believe reparations consists of white Americans alive today being held culpable for slavery and Jim Crow and personally responsible for compensation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed these sentiments in a recent interview, saying “I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago when none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea.” Both of these views are usually followed by technocratic arguments about the amount of money it would take or trying to determine citizen’s eligibility.

The study could address these questions head-on. It would show that reparations are an issue not between white and black Americans, but between the American government and the citizens it didn’t protect from racial violence and political, economic and social disenfranchisement. Because we are a capitalist society that accumulated wealth from the labor of enslaved people, financial penalties as restitution to close today’s racial wealth gap are often the default measures to address the historical wrongs. But we are also a democratic republic, so the study could explore other innovative means of reparations, such as this thought experiment on weighted voting in which African American’ votes are given more value than white votes for a designated period of time.

Because of the ease with which presidential commissions are created and the number of them presidents establish, they are sometimes cast as ineffective, low-cost tools to satisfy political demands without actually delivering policy solutions or reform. But when it comes to matters of civil rights and racial injustice, history demonstrates that American presidents have had to use the powers of the presidency to force the nation to confront its race issues rather than waiting on congressional action.

The two most consequential commissions regarding race relations in the past century are instructive on this point. Lynching and racial violence terrorized black Americans throughout the nation in the early 20th century, yet anti-lynching legislation routinely failed to make it through Congress. Civil rights activists pressed presidents to take action and finally met with some success after Harry Truman ascended to the White House. After hearing details about state and vigilante violence against black Americans, Truman exclaimed, “""My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We've got to do something!"" Three months later, he signed Executive Order 9808, which established the President’s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946 to investigate ways to strengthen civil rights protections. The group published its findings in a report a year later, recommending improved oversight of civil rights protections, anti-lynching measures, improvements in fair employment practices and the abolition of poll taxes. As a result, Truman desegregated the military and federal workforce by executive order, a move that helped ensure his improbable election victory in 1948. (As for anti-lynching legislation, Congress has still not sent a bill to any president’s desk.)

Twenty years after Truman’s Committee finalized its report, President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11365 creating the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders to analyze the causes behind a rash of race riots across the country. Commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, it published its report in February 1968 and found that the root of the uprising was black Americans’ lack of economic opportunity. The report did not mince its words, placing fault at the feet of racism and calling for federal housing, jobs and societal desegregation programs. Johnson mostly dismissed the report, but the information moved public opinion. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated two months after the report’s release, Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act of 1968 into law.

Of course, the study is just a first step. Any recommendations that come out of such a presidential commission would be nonbinding, subject to the president’s discretion and probably would require legislative action and judicial review before implementation. But given the evolving politics of reparations, a study can set the tone for wherever the debate goes next.

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

Let’s say you decide to call the White House and weigh in on the issues of the day. Chances are you may be on hold for a while, but when the line finally picks up, you’ll be greeted by a soothing voice to take your comment.

If you are really lucky, you’ll get Operator 16, who is not allowed to give her name. But we’ll let you in on a secret: That’s 99-year-old Louise Griffin, who’s been volunteering at the executive mansion for 26 years.

“Good morning,” she says. “This is the comment line. May I have your comment, please?”

Officially, she’s only supposed to stay on the line with you for two minutes, taking notes that will be passed on to her supervisor and maybe even the Oval Office. Most of the callers these days are phoning in to compliment President Trump.

“Well, most of them love him, so when they call they’re telling you that they really enjoy him,” she says. But sometimes, if a caller is mad about an issue or just annoyed about sitting on hold, Griffin will allow them to go on for more than the allotted time. “If I see that they need help with something, I’ll let them talk longer. And sometimes you can calm people down by helping. I have had them tell me, ‘You have helped me so much, and I am so happy that I got you.’ It’s a huge compliment.”

In a city bitterly divided along partisan lines, Griffin is absolutely nonpolitical and insistently optimistic. She’s worked for four presidents and thinks it’s a privilege to be part of history, whoever is in office.

“You meet different people from all over the world,” she says. “And it was so nice to know and hear what they had to say and how wonderful they thought it was. You know, there’s nothing like being in the White House. Really.”

Griffin was born on Dec. 18, 1919, and has spent her entire life in Washington. The fifth of six children, she grew up in Southwest and decided she was going to be a teacher when she was in fourth grade.

“I loved my elementary school teachers,” she says. “We had penmanship teachers when I was coming along and my teacher would allow me to do her roll book. And I said, ‘Oh, that’s nice of you.’ Ever since I wanted to be a teacher.”

There was a stint working for the Department of the Army during World War II, a few years at Howard University studying for her master’s in education, then a career as a teacher and an assistant principal in D.C. public schools, plus marriage and three kids.

It was, she says, a good life. Retirement, however, was not what she expected. Griffin was — well, let’s just say it — a little bored.

She ran a small catering business, took a calligraphy class at Catholic University, did a lot of puzzles. In 1993, when the Washington Calligraphers Guild announced that the White House needed more volunteers, Griffin raised her hand.

Apart from the West Wing political operatives who get so much media attention and then move on, the White House relies on lifelong employees and unpaid volunteers who do the behind-the-scenes work that ensures the executive mansion remains an American landmark. It’s a calling, more patriotic than partisan, and Griffin was thrilled to be part of it.

She showed up three or four days a week; she was so good that her supervisors vied to keep her in their offices.

Her first assignment was reading mail, not using her gorgeous handwriting. She worked on inaugurations, the annual Christmas tours, Easter Egg Rolls. She addressed greeting cards and other correspondence. The only thing she didn’t enjoy much was taking RSVPs for state dinners, where she discovered a little something about ambitious people.

“Sometimes they will do anything to get what they want,” she explains with just the slightest wrinkle of her nose. “And they’ll argue with you to get what they want.”

Along the way, she met Bill Clinton and George W. Bush but not Barack Obama or — so far — Trump. Because much of the volunteer work involves the East Wing, she has photos with Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.

Does she have a favorite president? “I can’t say that I did. I really can’t because I like them all.” Bill Clinton (spoiler alert) was chatty. Loved to talk to everyone. Loved to talk to the volunteers. And especially loved to talk to Griffin.

Eventually, she landed in the call center taking comments and discovered that all those years as a teacher were great preparation for that job.

What happens in the call center stays in the call center. The public comment line (202-456-1111) is staffed by volunteers who are sworn to keep the specific comments private. But most are reacting to current events: “Anything that they hear on the television or things that are happening,” Griffin says. “Mainly, that’s what they’re interested in.”

Before social media made it as easy to tweet at the president, calling was the preferred way for the public to share messages with the commander in chief. But even now, the lines never stop ringing, and people sometimes wait up to 30 minutes to make their feelings known.

Griffin believes it’s important that someone answers those calls: “Those people would not be able to express themselves if the volunteers weren’t answering those telephones.”

On Sept. 11, 2001, Griffin was in the call center at 9 that morning when a woman called.

“She was screaming and crying. I said, ‘I can’t understand what you’re saying.’ And she got herself together. She said, ‘A plane just hit the World Trade building.’ ”

The Secret Service ordered everyone to evacuate; the streets were filled with people trying to get a cell signal. There were rumors a plane was headed for the White House. It is the only sad memory she has of working there.

But Griffin returned the following Monday, a moment captured by a Reuters photographer as President Bush welcomed her and other volunteers back to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

“He was so happy that we came,” she says. Not every volunteer returned, but Griffin says she wasn’t afraid to go back. She figured it would not happen a second time.

The years have flown by; Griffin gave up some of her duties because they required so much standing. She’s now the oldest volunteer, a title that her colleagues don’t let her forget, and spends every Monday working the phones.

But at home she is surrounded by the White House every day. Official Easter eggs line her mantel and four presidential talking dolls sit in front of the fireplace. The living room desk holds photos of Griffin and the historic figures she has served, and her scrapbooks are filled with White House Christmas cards, programs from state visits and letters from presidents wishing her a “Happy Birthday” — the latest from Trump with his distinctive signature slashed across the bottom.

“I am inspired by the strength and selflessness you have exhibited throughout your life, and I am grateful for your more than 25 years of volunteer service at the White House. Thank you for your tireless dedication to helping ensure that the voices of the American people are heard.”

A lovely sentiment. He may even drop by the call center one of these Mondays."
Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress California official blasts EPA head over car standard negotiations MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"

Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs — only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money, but still had no degrees, and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Alexis Gurrola, a dental assisting student at Brightwood College, said she was told December 5 the college was closing. She said students and staff were told they would finish out the week, but that classes would not resume the following week. (Photo: Rachel Denny Clow/Caller-Times)

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but following a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann, of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. Translated, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation issues. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

Theproposed ruleswould also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their issues — double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

This is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said this measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

What happens next?

Want to review the proposed rules yourself? Visit the Federal Register, where the proposal is available in its entirety.

The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website.

Any rule changes would follow the public comment period.

Treasury bond yields are at the lowest level since 2016. Here's what that means,https://www.cnn.com,"['Anneken Tappe', 'Cnn Business']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/investing/10-year-treasury-yield/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Yields on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell to a two-and-a-half-year low Thursday morning after the Federal Reserve indicated multiple interest rate cuts could be coming soon.

Bond yields tend to fall when investors sense rate cuts are looming. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so if the price of a bond goes up, the yield goes down.

But Thursday's move is notable, because the last time the 10-year Treasury bond yielded less than 2% was in November 2016.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates nine times between late 2015 and late 2018, lifting yields on US government debt. The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3.2% in late 2018.

Since then, bond yields had been trending lower as investors sought safety amid a global economic slowdown.

DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
U.S. has no plans to cap H-1B work visa program: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-india-visas/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-program-state-department-idUSKCN1TL2VL,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds flags of India and the U.S. while people take part in the 35th India Day Parade in New York, U.S. August 16, 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

“The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,” a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administration’s “Buy American Hire American” executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is “completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,” the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: “We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government” on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/449444-va-chief-pressed-on-efforts-to-prevent-veteran-suicides,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieOvernight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA bans smoking, vaping at its hospitals MORE told lawmakers his agency is stepping up efforts to prevent veteran suicides during testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday.

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."
"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

"EGEB: First solar-powered US airport, solar prediction software, EPA's rule faces lawsuits",https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://electrek.co/2019/06/21/egeb-us-solar-airport/,"In today’s EGEB:

Chattanooga, Tennessee’s airport to be first in US to meet its energy needs with 100% solar power.

New software aims to simulate how solar panels will interact with the grid.

The new Affordable Clean Energy rule signed by the EPA is already being targeted in the courts.

Offshore wind expectations for the US keep increasing.

Electrek Green Energy Brief: A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.

Officials at Tennessee’s Chattanooga Airport announced the completion of its solar farm, which will make the airport the first in the US to get all of its power from solar, the Times Free Press reports.

The airport’s solar farm was launched in 2011, and now, eight years later, it’s able to support the airport’s daily power needs. From the Times Free Press:

The $10 million project will be capable of generating 4.3 megawatts of electricity and will be the second biggest solar array in Chattanooga — behind only the $30 million solar farm installed at the Volkswagen assembly plant in 2012 to generate up to 9.5 megawatts of electricity.

It’s not the only notable solar project in Chattanooga recently, as the city introduced a solar farm to partially power a wastewater treatment plant earlier this year.

Chattanooga’s airport is small — it only has five gates. But it’s set a new solar standard for other airports, no matter the size.

Solar Software

New software introduced by Sandia National Laboratories may spur solar development by quickly simulating the connection of rooftop panels to the electrical grid, showing utility companies how those panels may interact with the grid over the course of a year.

While previous software took days to run such a scenario, this new software enables quicker, more detailed simulations that show grid impact. A simulation that used to take 36 hours will now take five minutes. Sandia engineer Matthew Reno said of the software,

“You can jump through time faster at some points and put the computational effort where it is most needed, using event-based simulation or variable time-step. During cloudy periods with varying amounts of sunlight, the simulation slows down and looks at the impact second by second. When there is low variability, like at night when everything is fairly stable, the simulation can jump forward with larger time steps, making the program more efficient.”

ACE in the Hole

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator and former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler signed the EPA’s new Affordable Clean Energy rule into effect on Wednesday. Though not unexpected, the rule — which is transparently designed to prop up aging coal-fired power plants — is already in the legal crosshairs.

Just as the Clean Power Plan that it replaced drew the ire of some states, the new rule is being eyed for challenges by blue states and environmental groups, Roll Call reports.

The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund have already expressed their desire to legally oppose the new rule, which weakens emission standards. Attorney Generals from New York, California, and Oregon, have also discussed their intention to sue.

It’s expected that such legal battles could drag on for years, further clouding the picture of how the country will deal with power plant emissions in the near future.

More Offshore

US states have raised their offshore wind requirements from 15,000 MW to 20,000 MW in the last five months alone, the Union of Concerned Scientists notes.

It can be hard to keep up with the increasing requirements, as states are competing in an industry that’s really just gotten started in the US. Europe currently has an installed capacity of 18,000 MW of offshore wind, to keep the numbers in perspective.

Meanwhile, over there, in the UK, Ørsted is celebrating its quick development on the Hornsea One wind farm by quoting Bon Jovi:

We've now installed and fully commisioned half the turbines on Hornsea One… that's 87 of the 174 total in just FOUR MONTHS! 😮😮 In the words of @jonbonjovi ""WOAH! WE'RE HALFWAY THERE!!"" 🙌🙌Another 87 to go before it officially becomes the world's largest offshore wind farm! pic.twitter.com/4r1JHaoXHV — Ørsted UK (@OrstedUK) June 18, 2019

Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

The State Department headquarters in Washington in March 2009. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, had been expected to be transferred to the notorious Rikers Island jail complex this month to await trial on a separate state case.

But last week, Manhattan prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the second-highest law enforcement official in the country inquiring about Mr. Manafort’s case. The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, Attorney General William P. Barr’s new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York.

And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney’s office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers.

Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
Vaccine Investigators Use Bacterium's Own Protein Against It : USDA ARS,https://www.ars.usda.gov,[],,,,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2019/vaccine-investigators-use-bacteriums-own-protein-against-it/,"A cow naturally infected with M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis that is in the late stages of disease and has typical clinical signs such as weight loss, watery diarrhea, and general poor health. This cow is part of a study herd used in research on Johne’s disease at the National Animal Disease Center, Ames, Iowa.

Vaccine Investigators Use Bacterium's Own Protein Against It

By Jan Suszkiw

June 21, 2019

A team of Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and university scientists is investigating a new “ingredient” for use in vaccinating cattle against Johne’s disease, a chronic wasting affliction that costs the U.S. dairy industry more than $200 million per year.

The ingredient in question is a type of protein on the surface of the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), which causes Johne’s disease.

The researchers found that the protein, dubbed 35 kDa membrane peptide, helps the bacterium invade epithelial cells lining the cow's small intestine, thickening it and blocking the uptake of nutrients from feed or forage. This can lead to diarrhea, weight loss, diminished milk production and sometimes death. Calves are especially vulnerable and if their mothers are infected, they can acquire the bacterium from the colostrum of their mothers. Adult animals typically become infected after grazing on forage or pasture areas where MAP has been excreted or ""shed"" in feces.

Vaccinating the animals with dead MAP cells can prevent such fecal shedding; however, this process can also generate misleading results called false-positives when vaccinated cattle are tested for bovine tuberculosis, a disease caused by a close relative of the bacterium.

An alternative approach could come from vaccinating the animals with specific pieces of MAP rather than using the entire bacterium, notes John Bannantine, a microbiologist with the ARS National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa.

Toward that end, he and colleagues from Washington State University and Inje University in Gimhae, South Korea, devised a new laboratory procedure called an ex vivo bacterium viability assay. Using it, they evaluated the peptide's potential as a vaccine through its ability to mobilize certain immune system cells in blood samples drawn from infected cattle rather than using the animals themselves.

The results, among others reported in the May 2019 issue of Vaccine, showed that the peptide helps prime immune cells called cytotoxic CD8 T cells to seek out infected cells and kill MAP bacteria present within them. There is no haven from cytotoxic T cells, adds Bannantine, with the ARS center's Infectious Bacterial Diseases Research Unit.

Upcoming studies will focus on ways to formulate and deliver the peptide. Once there is a successful formulation, they will conduct cattle vaccine trials. Ultimately, the research could open the door to a new way of preventing Johne's disease without interference with bovine tuberculosis tests.

U.S. human trafficking report drops child separation warning,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Landay', 'Min Read']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-humantrafficking/us-human-trafficking-report-drops-child-separation-warning-idUSKCN1TL2IV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department’s annual human trafficking report released on Thursday demoted Saudi Arabia and Cuba to countries that failed to meet minimum U.S. anti-trafficking standards.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House senior advisor Ivanka Trump award Veronica Supliguicha from Ecuador during an event to release of 2019 Trafficking in Persons report at the State Department in Washington, U.S., June 20, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

The report here also dropped a warning from the 2018 issue that traffickers prey on children separated from their parents. Policies implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their families.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Ivanka Trump, a top adviser to her father, released the 2019 Trafficking in Persons report at a State Department ceremony at which Pompeo called human trafficking “a stain ... on all of humanity.”

Saudi Arabia and Cuba were downgraded to countries that have failed to make significant anti-trafficking efforts after both were kept on a watchlist for four years, said the report.

In his remarks, Pompeo pointed to Cuba’s demotion to Tier 3 - the worst ranking the report can give a country - and noted that it joined Iran, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Syria and Russia.

He did not mention, however, the demotion of oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. ally and arms buyer.

Some lawmakers and human rights advocates have already questioned the report’s objectivity after Reuters disclosed on Tuesday that Pompeo declined to place Saudi Arabia on a list of countries that recruit child soldiers, dismissing his own experts’ findings that a Saudi-led coalition uses under-aged fighters in Yemen.

John Cotton Richmond, the ambassador-at-large who oversaw the writing of the report and whose office recommended the kingdom be placed on the child soldiers list, told reporters on Thursday afternoon that Pompeo determined that Saudi Arabia “did not rise to the level to warrant a listing.”

Yet the trafficking report’s section on Saudi Arabia cited numerous reports of the Saudi-led coalition recruiting Sudanese and Yemeni children to fight Houthi rebels. The coalition denies using child soldiers.

Inclusion on Tier 3 can bring restrictions on U.S. non-humanitarian, non-trade-related assistance, a decision made by the president, who limited aid to 22 countries listed in that category last year. But it is unlikely that Trump will act against Saudi Arabia amid rising tensions between the United States and the kingdom’s regional rival, Iran.

The United States provides no aid to Cuba’s Communist government. Its placement in Tier 3 comes as the Trump administration rolls back the detente that occurred under former President Barack Obama.

The 2019 report also dropped a section included in last year’s document that warned against removing children from their families because they can become vulnerable to trafficking.

“The physical and psychological effects of staying in residential institutions, combined with societal isolation and often subpar regulatory oversight by governments, place these children in situations of heightened vulnerability to human trafficking,” the 2018 report said.

The U.S. section of this year’s report made no mention of the separation of more than 2,700 children from migrant families who illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, and the children’s placement in government custody.

The separations, which occurred during the period covered by the report, were implemented under a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration that subjected parents to criminal charges.

Trump rescinded the separation policy in June 2018 amid international outcry.

Judith Kelley, dean of Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy and author of a book on the trafficking report’s impact, said Trump’s child separation policy should have been cited.

But its exclusion should not diminish the extent of U.S. anti-trafficking efforts or the impetus the report gives other countries to improve their ratings, she added."
USDA moves prevent plant harvest date to September 1st,https://www.ksfy.com,['Sam Wright'],,,,https://www.ksfy.com/content/news/USDA-Moves-prevent-plant-harvest-date-to-September-1st-511606771.html,"This year has been historically tough for South Dakota's AG industry thanks to above normal precipitation, but the USDA adjusted a federal aid package announced by President Trump a month ago which required farmers to plant cover crop on prevent plant acres by November first. It initially received mixed criticism because South Dakota is notorious for unpredictable, and usually harsh weather. Dave Poppens works with beans, corn, has a feed lot, and knows the natural challenge he is tasked with overcoming every year; which is why a change in dates helps level the playing field with states in more manageable climates.

""November we could have a foot of snow on the ground, so it makes a big difference in this part of the country,"" Poppens said.

The move has received support from many of South Dakota’s state leaders including Governor Kristi Noem, Congressman Dusty Johnson, and Senator John Thune.

""I have been advocating for this common sense change for months. You don't have to talk to more than two producers in South Dakota that waiting until November the first to allow them to either graze or mechanically harvest cover crops without an indemnity reduction on their prevent acres is far too late,” Senator Thune said.

There is another component of this, producers will also have the flexibility to allow cattle to graze on cover crop areas. The wet season has diminished forage options for a lot of operations.

""Now you can plan on things,” said South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association president Steve Ollerich.

“You can't plan for November first. We could have a blizzard October 10 or 15 and it'd be all covered up with snow.""

"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Todd Ackerman', 'Staff Writer', 'Geoffrey A. Fowler', 'The Washington Post', 'John Mcclain', 'Aaron Wilson']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

Walmart Pays $282 Million to Settle Federal Foreign Bribery Case,http://fortune.com,['Tom Schoenberg'],06-20-2019,2019,6,http://fortune.com/2019/06/20/walmart-pays-fine-doj-brazil-bribe-probe/,"Walmart Inc. has agreed to pay $282 million in penalties and a Brazilian unit admitted to violating a U.S. anti-bribery law, providing a relatively subdued ending to a seven-year investigation that spanned the globe and at one point looked poised to yield record foreign-corruption fines.

In parallel announcements on Thursday, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission faulted the country’s largest retailer over payments made to fast-track store openings in Mexico, China, Brazil, and India. Walmart will pay about $138 million in criminal penalties and $144 million in disgorgement to resolve the SEC’s allegations.

WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to keep accurate records, while the U.S. parent reached a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company will have a compliance monitor for two years as part of that accord and Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said the company is “committed to doing business the right way.”

The retailer’s operations in Brazil are currently handled by a company called Walmart Brasil, which is 80% owned by private-equity firm Advent International.

The entity that pleaded guilty, WMT Brasilia, “was and always has been a holding company,”

according to a Walmart spokesperson. “Today it has ownership of the entity which owns 20% of the current business after we sold it last year.”

The resolution, disclosed in court filings in Virginia and press releases, was a muted end to what was once seen as a case targeting high-level officers. At one point, people familiar with the probe have said, U.S. authorities were asking up to $1 billion in penalties. While the penalty is about one-sixth of the $1.78 billion levied last year against Petroleo Brasileiro SA in one of South America’s biggest corruption scandals, Walmart wound up spending about $1 billion in legal fees and an overhaul of its compliance systems.

“The case may not have turned out to be as good or as fruitful as the government thought,” said Michael Koenig, a former federal prosecutor now a partner at Hinckley, Allen & Snyder. “This notion that the government is only successful if it gets a conviction or a billion-dollar settlement is just plain wrong. You have to go where the investigation leads and what may have started out as thinking this was going to be the greatest investigation since Enron for a host of reasons turned out not to be what the government thought.”

The expectation of what the Walmart investigation might reveal were set by a series of articles in the New York Times in 2012 outlining details of allegations the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses, and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Walmart into that country’s largest private-sector employer.

Allegations that America’s largest retailer was running a pay-to-play scheme outside the U.S. gave a boost to the Justice Department’s FCPA unit, which had suffered some high-profile court losses and was defending attempts by business interest groups to rein in its prosecutors.

But the Walmart case posed challenges for investigators. Much of the conduct uncovered in Mexico, for example, couldn’t be used as evidence because it was too old, people familiar with the matter have previously said. So the government sought to build stronger cases in other countries. In Brazil and India, investigators found more recent examples of what they believed were improper payments, yet struggled to find examples of rampant misconduct in China, the people said.

In the closing days of the Obama administration, Walmart balked at demands to pay more than $600 million in penalties, leading prosecutors to go back to gather more evidence from witnesses, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg at the time. That, in turn, led to a lengthy secret court battle over whether the Justice Department could bring Walmart’s internal lawyers before the grand jury. By this point, the investigation had already spanned more than five years.

In 2017, the company set aside almost $300 million for a possible settlement. Months later, a federal appeals court in Virginia blocked the Justice Department from interviewing Walmart’s lawyers, removing leverage the government had in the criminal case. The two sides became deadlocked for months over what misconduct the retail giant would admit to, a person familiar with the matter previously said.

On Thursday, the Brazilian unit admitted that $527,000 in improper payments to an intermediary were inaccurately recorded on financial records. Brazil employees logged those payments as going to construction companies when they knew the money was going to a former Brazilian government official, according to the plea agreement filed in Virginia. The former official’s ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly earned her the nickname “sorceress” or “genie,” according to the unit’s plea agreement. Walmart earned more than $3.6 million in profit from stores built by these construction companies.

The non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. outlines much broader conduct that prosecutors said ran from 2000 to 2011 and included Mexico, China, and India. Walmart executives were aware of problems regarding payments by the foreign subsidiaries to third parties but failed to stop them, according to the Justice Department.

“In numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws,” assistant attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in a statement.

No criminal charges against individuals have been brought.

"Pete Buttigieg says ""it's almost certain"" he wouldn't be first gay president",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buttigieg-weve-probably-had-excellent-presidents-who-were-gay/,"2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg could make history as the youngest president in the history of the United States — and the first openly gay one. Buttigieg, however, believes he wouldn't be the only gay president.

Pete Buttigieg Axios on HBO

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out as gay in 2015, before being elected to his second term as mayor. He is now married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman, who would become first gentleman if Buttigieg wins the presidency.

In an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" Buttigieg was asked about critics potentially saying he's too young, too liberal and too gay to be commander-in-chief.

He was asked, ""You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""

""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country,"" the candidate replied. ""People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

Buttigieg said ""statistically, it's almost certain"" that there has been a gay president before. Of course, none have been openly gay, and almost every president, except for two, have been married to women.

An estimated 4.5 percent of the U.S. population is LGBTQ, a 2018 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found. So Buttigieg's assumption that at least one out of the nation's 45 presidents was gay is not so far-fetched — he just doesn't know which one.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively,"" he told Axios. ""But one can only assume that's the case."""

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""
