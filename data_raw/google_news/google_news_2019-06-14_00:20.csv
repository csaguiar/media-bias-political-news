Trump rushes into damage control after saying he’d accept foreign help in 2020,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Restuccia'],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/trump-tweet-interference-1363403,"""My full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media,” President Donald Trump said Thursday, suggesting that some of his recent comments were being taken out of context. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images White House Trump rushes into damage control after saying he’d accept foreign help in 2020 The president, who said he talks to foreign leaders every day, turned to his familiar tactic of blaming the media.

President Donald Trump and his senior advisers moved quickly on Thursday to downplay and muddle his explosive assertion that he might not report to the FBI offers of election help from a foreign entity.

As Trump's Democratic opponents eviscerated him and one of his leading Republican supporters called his comments a ""mistake,"" the president tried to recast his remarks, drawing a misleading comparison between accepting dirt from a foreign agent and his recent conversations with Queen Elizabeth and other world leaders.

“I meet and talk to ‘foreign governments’ every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about ‘Everything!’” Trump wrote on Twitter across a pair of tweets, correcting an initial misspelling of Wales. “Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again.”

Every president regularly communicates with other heads of state. Accepting negative information from a foreign agent about a campaign opponent is a different matter, however. It is a crime for a campaign to solicit or accept something of value from a foreign entity, which some lawyers say could apply to information.

Amid the firestorm, Trump and his top aides also turned to a familiar tactic: blaming the media. They argued that the president's comments were taken out of context, insisting the reporting about his ABC News interview lacked nuance.

""My full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media,” Trump said on Twitter without offering evidence to support his claim. “They purposely leave out the part that matters.”

poster=""https://static.politico.com/e2/d5/31b889b2444598a776f522c7da43/190613-trump-abcnews-campos.png"" true

Later Thursday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley echoed Trump's assertion. ""Look, I wish the media would take the time to look at the full clip. I was standing just feet away from the president in is exchange with George Stephanopoulos. It was very clear the president said if there was wrongdoing, of course he'd turn it over to the F.B.I,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.

However, the president's full statement shows he was equivocal about whether he'd alert the FBI if he was presented with damaging information about his political opponents. ABC News later released a full transcript of the interview, which shows the network accurately represented the president's comments.

Trump scoffed when asked by ABC's George Stephanopoulos whether his son should have alerted federal authorities when he found out about a 2016 meeting with Russian nationals who claimed to have damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

""I’ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don’t call the FBI,"" he said, adding later, ""Give me a break. Life doesn't work that way."" He also said FBI Director Christopher Wray was “wrong” for saying that candidates should report to the agency efforts by foreign agents to interfere in an election.

Later, Stephanopoulos asked if he would call the FBI if Russia, China or other foreign entities offered negative information about an opponent. Trump said, ""I think, maybe, you do both. I think you might want to listen. There's nothing wrong with listening.""

Trump's team has repeatedly been pressed about how to handle foreign offers of campaign help after it became public that his son, son-in-law and campaign manager met in June 2016 with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer who claimed to have information about Clinton. Trump's team has said nothing came of the meeting. While special counsel Robert Mueller found that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election to help the president, he did not find enough evidence to conclude Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in that effort.

Trump's comments triggered a barrage of criticism. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Trump's latest comments “invited” more foreign interference in U.S. elections.

“Our foreign adversaries listen to every president — every word the president of the United States has to say, as we clearly saw when he encouraged the Russians to hack his opponents’ emails and hours later they tried to do exactly that,” Schiff (D-Calif.) told POLITICO. “So I think he has invited another round of interference. As long as it’s to help his campaign, he seems more than happy to engage in any act, no matter how unethical or unlawful.”

Speaker Nancy Pelosi also expressed outrage, but signaled Trump's comments didn't change her opposition to pursuing impeachment. ""Everyone in the country should be appalled by what he said last night, totally appalled,” Pelosi said Thursday.

Numerous Republicans distanced themselves from Trump's comments on Thursday. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent Trump defender, said the president's remarks were wrong. ""I think it's a mistake. I think it's a mistake of law. I don't want to send a signal to encourage this,"" he said.

Trump also sought to shift focus to Democrats, accusing Schiff and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, of accepting negative information about him without calling the FBI. The pair were both involved in investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump did not cite any evidence to support his claim that they did not alert the FBI about information they found.

Rachel Cohen, Warner's communications director, tweeted that she didn't know what Trump was talking about. ""This never happened,"" she wrote.

….which he is a member. When @RepAdamSchiff took calls from another person, also very successfully purporting to be a Russian Operative, did he call the FBI, or even think to call the FBI? NO! The fact is that the phony Witch Hunt is a giant scam where Democrats,… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2019

""The fact is that the phony Witch Hunt is a giant scam where Democrats, and other really bad people, SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!"" Trump said over two tweets. ""They even had an 'insurance policy' just in case Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost their race for the Presidency! This is the biggest & worst political scandal in the history of the United States of America. Sad!""

Schiff, for his part, was pranked in 2017 by Russian comedians who told him in a phone call that Russia had compromising materials about Trump. However, Schiff, during the phone call, said he would work with the FBI to review the information, according to an audio recording of the conversation released by the pranksters.

The White House said Thursday that Democrats were being hypocritical since Clinton's campaign was at one time involved in funding research into Trump that eventually yielded a dossier of information about him. The research, which was initially funded by Republicans, wound up in the hands of the FBI.

EXCLUSIVE: President Trump slams presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris as 'doing horribly' after saying she'd prosecute Trump,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-slams-presidential-hopeful-sen-kamala-harris/story?id=63688366,"President Donald Trump slammed Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris for saying that, if elected, she would “have no choice” but to pursue criminal charges of obstruction of justice against a former President Trump.

“Oh, give me a break. She's running for president. She's doing horribly. She's way down in the polls,” the president said in reaction to Harris’ comments during his exclusive interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos.

“She said she would have no choice but to prosecute you,” Stephanopoulos said.

The president was reacting to comments Harris, herself a former prosecutor who served as the San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, made in an interview with NPR, suggesting that in her administration, the Justice Department would have to pursue criminal obstruction of justice charges.

""I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,"" said Harris, who noted there are 10 instances of potential obstruction by the president detailed in Mueller’s report and added that “everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.""

But even as the president blasted Harris’ comment, he also suggested he’d say the same thing if he were in her shoes.

“I heard she made that statement. And you know what? Who wouldn't? Probably if I were running in her position, I'd make the same statement,” the president said, casting Harris’ position as a political posture.

He continued: “There was no crime. There was no Russia collusion. There was no Russia, I'll put it in your language, conspiracy, which is even better than collusion.”

The Harris campaign doubled down on its critique.

""Donald Trump is using the Department of Justice to run interference on his own behalf, and he's appointed an Attorney General to act like his personal defense lawyer, not the lawyer for the American people. Senator Harris believes no one is above the law, not even the President of the United States, and as president, she would restore an independent DOJ that values the rule of law and follows facts and evidence wherever they lead,"" Ian Sams, Harris' national press secretary told ABC News in a statement.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish there was a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but it did detail several “offers of assistance to the [Trump] campaign” by the Russian government. Mueller did not make a decision about whether the president obstructed justice, the special counsel said because charging the president with a crime was ""not an option we could consider"" because of Justice Department policy.

The word ""collusion,"" itself, as members of President Trump’s legal team have repeatedly pointed out, does not appear in the federal code.

The president also reacted angrily to the statement that more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors from both Democratic and Republican administrations have signed onto stating that President Trump would be charged with multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice if not for long-standing Department of Justice policy protecting a sitting president from prosecution.

“I know more about prosecutors than you'll ever know,” Trump said when Stephanopoulos pressed Trump to respond to the statement, countering that he could bring forward thousands of prosecutors to his defense.

“They're politicians. I could get you 5,000 that would also say that there's nothing. I saw their names. And these are all, many of them, are Trump haters. Many of them if you look at the names.”

ABC News

Many of those names are Republicans, Stephanopoulos responded to the president.

In continuing his defense, Trump specifically pointed to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who is a frequent defender of the president.

“I could get you thousands of prosecutors that say this is the most unfair– you take a man like Alan Dershowitz, who's a very brilliant guy. He thinks this is one of the worst things ever to happen to our country because I've been unfairly treated,” Trump said.

The president continued: “Even a question like that’s unfair.”

“Mr. President, there’s nothing unfair about the question,” Stephanopoulos responded."
"Trump unveils new red, white and blue Air Force One paint job",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-unveils-air-force-one-paint-job,"President Trump, in an interview aired Thursday, unveiled the new red, white and blue paint job for the new Air Force One -- and promised that the jet would also be much bigger than the existing presidential plane.

“Here’s your new Air Force One and I’m doing that for other presidents, not for me,” Trump told ABC News in the Oval Office.

TRUMP: NEW AIR FORCE ONE WILL HAVE 'RED, WHITE AND BLUE' PAINT SCHEME

The scheme involves a blue base and a white top, with a thin red line through the middle where the windows are situated.

The red, white and blue paint job replaces the current white and light blue design selected by President John Kennedy and first lady Jackie Kennedy. Axios reported that he wanted a “more American” scheme that isn’t “Jackie Kennedy color.”

The redesign comes as part of the contract with Boeing to build a fleet of two new Air Force jets. Trump was a critic of the project and eventually reached a deal with Boeing to buy the jets for $3.9 billion -- $1.4 billion down from the original estimate.

""It's a 747, but you know, it's a much bigger plane,"" Trump told ABC. ""It's a much bigger wing span.""

Trump was asked if it had an escape pod similar to that in the “Air Force One” movie starring Harrison Ford.

“You know what, there are a couple of secrets I don’t think we’re supposed to be talking about,” Trump joked.

The new jets are scheduled to arrive by 2024.

Brace for a Voter-Turnout Tsunami,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Ronald Brownstein'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-election-voter-turnout-could-be-record-breaking/591607/,"“I think we are heading for a record presidential turnout at least in the modern era, and by that I mean since the franchise went to 18-year-olds,” in 1972, says Glen Bolger, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies. “And I mean not only in total numbers [but also] in terms of the percentage of eligible voters [who turn out]. The emotion behind politics … is sky-high, and I don’t think it’s just on one side. I think it’s on both sides.”

Read: The Democratic debate over winning back Trump’s base

McDonald thinks the turnout surge in 2020 could shatter even older records, estimating that as many as two-thirds of eligible voters may vote next year. If that happens, it would represent the highest presidential-year turnout since 1908, when 65.7 percent of eligible Americans cast a ballot, according to McDonald’s figures. Since 18-year-olds were granted the vote, the highest showing was the 61.6 percent of eligible voters who showed up in 2008, leading to Barack Obama’s victory. And since World War II, the highest turnout level came in 1960, with John F. Kennedy’s win, when 63.8 percent of voters participated.

Experts on both sides point to an array of indicators that signal turnout may reach new heights next year. Signs of political interest, from the number of small-donor contributions made to presidential candidates to the viewership for cable news, are all spiking. In polls, very high shares of Americans already say they are paying a lot of attention to the 2020 presidential race.

But the clearest sign that high turnout may be approaching in 2020 is that it already arrived in 2018. In last year’s midterm, nearly 120 million people voted, about 35 million more than in the previous midterm, in 2014, with 51 percent of eligible voters participating—a huge increase over the previous three midterms. The 2018 level represented the largest share of eligible voters to turn out in a midterm year since 1914, according to McDonald’s figures. Catalist estimated that about 14 million new voters who had not participated in 2016 turned out two years later, and they preferred Democrats by a roughly 20-percentage-point margin.

Yet one of the key questions for 2020 is whether Democrats will benefit as much from the likely expansion of the electorate. With Trump on the ballot directly, Republicans hope that 2020 will produce a surge not only in the younger and nonwhite voters who increased their participation in 2018, but also the non-college-educated whites at the foundation of the president’s support, who lagged last year.

The nature of the population eligible to vote is evolving in a way that should indeed help Democrats. McDonald estimates that the number of eligible voters increases by about 5 million each year, or about 20 million from one presidential election to the next. That increase predominantly flows from two sources: young people who turn 18 and immigrants who become citizens. Since people of color are now approaching a majority of the under-18 population—and also constitute most immigrants—McDonald and other experts believe it’s likely that minorities represent a majority of the people who have become eligible to vote since 2016."
DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."
USDA research agencies will move to Kansas City region despite opposition,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'June At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/06/13/usda-research-agencies-will-move-kansas-city-region-perdue-announces/,"

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Two scientific agencies in the Department of Agriculture will move from Washington to the greater Kansas City region, USDA announced Thursday, despite strong resistance to the plan.

Nearly 550 positions at the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science, are expected to be moved by the end of the federal fiscal year, Sept. 30. USDA estimated the savings at $300 million over 15 years from employment and rent.

“The Kansas City Region has proven itself to be hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America’s heartland,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The news release did not identify the location of the offices. But Tim Cowden, president and chief executive of the Kansas City Area Development Council, said the agency is evaluating office property on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri border.

Perdue had unveiled a plan to relocate the two agencies in August, without specifying a site. He called the decision a cost-saving measure and said it would bring them closer to their “stakeholders” in farming regions. Initially, he also proposed placing ERS under the Office of the Chief Economist but that was not part of the final plan, according to a letter the secretary sent employees on Thursday.

Scientists across the country rely on NIFA grants to study topics ranging from climate change and crop genetics to farmland drones. ERS produces statistical reports that influence decisions in corporate boardrooms and in state and federal capitals.

Republican senators representing Missouri and Kansas welcomed Thursday’s announcement. “We’re home to some of the hardest working farmers in the country, so this is a fantastic decision by the USDA,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a statement.

NIFA and ERS workers will join nearly 5,000 other USDA employees in Kansas City, said Cowden, whose group proposed the region to USDA last year.

“We’re within 300 miles of 13 land grant universities,” said Kimberly Young, president of the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, a development council initiative. The area is an epicenter of the animal health industry, Young said, with more than 300 such companies nearby.

But current employees of the two agencies, several Democratic lawmakers and a bipartisan coalition of former USDA leaders warned that the move, more than 900 miles from Washington, would devastate the two agencies.

“This is not just a change of address,” said Jack Payne, University of Florida’s senior vice president for agriculture. “It cuts NIFA off from the collaboration with other federal funding agencies in D.C. that are its major partners.”

NIFA unionized earlier this week, and ERS unionized in May in the face of the decision. Union officials have promised to fight the move. As Perdue addressed NIFA and ERS employees in an auditorium Thursday afternoon, members of the bargaining unit stood and turned their backs to the secretary in protest.

“The announcement today should be met with great skepticism that Secretary Perdue has the best interests of either federal employees or American agriculture in mind,” said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, which represents ERS employees.

In a call with reporters Thursday afternoon, Perdue acknowledged that some employees have “expressed displeasure” with the move. “I understand that no one ever wants their cheese moved,” he said, referring to a 2000 book on business management. He suggested USDA employees who wish to remain in the District seek “other options here in federal service.”

Perdue also said the General Services Administration, the agency that manages federal real estate, will begin the process of acquiring office space around July 1.

Jeffrey Neal, a chief human resources officer in the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said if USDA began issuing notices to employees this month the department “could pull it off by the end of the fiscal year.” Neal predicted such a swift move would be expensive — USDA estimated relocation will cost $50,000 per worker — and “messy,” losing numerous employees in the process.

Gale Buchanan, USDA chief scientist under President George W. Bush, and Catherine E. Woteki, chief scientist in the Obama administration, predicted the relocation would set ERS back “five to 10 years” due to a loss of specialized employees, as they wrote in a 2018 letter to Congress signed by dozens of agricultural leaders.

“There isn’t a plan in place for how to manage this,” Woteki told The Washington Post. The offices, which together employ about 700 people when fully staffed, are roughly two-thirds the size they were during the Obama administration.

Workloads have ballooned as ERS employees have quit at double the normal rate since October, The Post reported. Acting officials have filled several vacant ERS leadership positions.

USDA lacks a chief scientist, who oversees ERS, NIFA and other USDA research offices. Trump’s first nominee, radio host Sam Clovis, withdrew from consideration over his ties to the investigation of Russia’s influence on the 2016 election. Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) placed a hold on Trump’s second nominee, former Dow Chemical executive Scott Hutchins, because the senator opposes the relocation, Van Hollen’s spokeswoman said. In January, Perdue appointed Hutchins deputy undersecretary for research, education, and economics, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

“Our overarching concern is what happens to the important scientific work that these two agencies perform at USDA on behalf of the public, on behalf of farmers and rural communities and everyone who eats,” said Karen Perry Stillerman, an analyst who specializes in food and the environment at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that advocates for researchers.

NIFA currently rents costly offices on the Washington waterfront, and ERS leases space in the nearby Patriots Plaza. In April, Perdue announced a plan he dubbed “OneNeighborhood,” which seeks to consolidate workers into two USDA-owned buildings in the capital region. But ERS and NIFA employees slated for the move, per an April 19 memo obtained by The Post, were excluded from OneNeighborhood.

Peter Winch, an organizer for American Federation of Government Employees, said the two agencies held all-hands meetings on May 22 to discuss buyouts and severance payments. Once employees receive relocation letters, they will have 30 days to decide whether to move. USDA will offer 30 or fewer buyouts per agency, he said employees were told.

Using an internal ERS document known as the “stay-go” list, analysts at the Union of Concerned Scientists identified nearly 80 jobs scheduled to remain in Washington. The bulk belong to administrative staff, analysts who perform market outlook estimates and those who collect data. Economists and other ERS researchers who make conclusions from that data are likely to be reassigned to Kansas City, according to this analysis.

But USDA disputed that. “Of the 76 ERS positions staying in the National Capitol Region, over half of these positions perform core research functions,” USDA spokeswoman Meghan Rodgers said in an email.

Democratic lawmakers have also vowed to try to block the move. “We hope that Congress will recognize that this is legitimate executive function,” Perdue told reporters on Thursday.

A federal department must pass a “very low bar” in providing reasons for reassignments, Neal said. “The ability of Congress, with split control of the House and the Senate, to stop something like this in its tracks is questionable.""

House appropriators recently prohibited funds for the move in a 2020 appropriations bill. “It is alarming that the administration is rushing ahead with this relocation in order to circumvent Congress,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement. Hoyer vowed “to explore all options to reverse this decision.”

Senate Democrats introduced a bill to keep the agencies in the national capital region, mirroring House legislation introduced earlier this year by Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine). Van Hollen said Thursday he would offer this legislation as an amendment to the defense budget bill recently released by the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I will continue to fight this tooth and nail,” he said in a statement.

Lawmakers have also questioned whether the secretary has the authority to relocate these offices without congressional approval, prompting an investigation by the USDA’s inspector general office.

After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’"
Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/448383-feds-gone-wild-dojs-stunning-inability-to-prosecute-its-own-bad,"One was caught red-handed engaged in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeComey: Trump peddling 'dumb lies' Liz Cheney: Statements by agents investigating Trump 'could well be treason' Five takeaways from Barr's new powers in 'spying' probe MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeySchiff threatens to subpoena FBI Schiff threatens to subpoena FBI Trump campaign contacts with Moscow to be focus for Democrats MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

Presidents long have fought to shield sensitive White House documents and discussions from congressional scrutiny by asserting executive privilege. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to use the phrase “executive privilege” after refusing to allow his advisers to testify at a Senate hearing in May 1954. Eisenhower believed that what is said in the White House should stay in the White House.

“Any man who testifies as what he told me won’t be working for me that night,” the president said.

On Wednesday, President Trump asserted executive privilege to shield documents from Congress that would provide insight into the administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

[Trump asserts executive privilege to shield documents on census citizenship question]

It is the second time the president has invoked executive privilege. In May, he asserted it over special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report.

Executive privilege is “the right of the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts and ultimately the public,” according to Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Executive privilege, Rozell wrote, can be used to protect national security and “the privacy of White House deliberations.”

The Constitution makes no mention of the concept of executive privilege. However, presidents from George Washington to Trump have resisted demands to share sensitive information with Congress. Some have succeeded. But over the past few decades, presidents have lost key court battles to withhold information.

It all began in 1792 when President George Washington declared that he didn’t have to provide internal documents demanded for a congressional investigation into a disastrous military loss by Maj. Gen. Arthur St. Clair to Native Americans. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton warned that in the future, Congress “might demand secrets of a very mischievous nature.” But Washington eventually turned over papers that “the public good would permit.”

[Target of the first congressional probe in U.S. history? George Washington, of course.]

In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson claimed he was exempt from a subpoena for him to testify at the trial of his former vice president Aaron Burr, who was charged with treason.

“Constantly trudging” to the trial in Richmond, he said, would prevent him from fulfilling his presidential duties. Chief Justice John Marshall, who was presiding over the trial, ruled that the president wasn’t exempt. Jefferson didn’t testify, but he did “voluntarily” provide documents sought by Burr, who was acquitted.

Presidential power expanded in 1833, when President Andrew Jackson refused a demand by the U.S. Senate to turn over a list of advisers with whom he consulted before moving money from the national bank to state banks. “I have yet to learn under what constitutional authority that a branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an account of any communications,” Jackson responded. The Senate voted to censure Jackson, but it still didn’t get Old Hickory’s documents.

President Grover Cleveland “almost single-handedly restored and strengthened the power” of the presidency by his frequent use of executive privilege, according to Henry F. Graff, professor emeritus of history at Columbia University. After taking office in 1885, Cleveland declined to hand over documents to Congress “in the fight over presidential appointments,” Graff wrote.

In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt refused to give the Senate his administration’s papers about an antitrust prosecution of U.S. Steel Corp. To make sure senators didn’t get the documents, Roosevelt had them moved to the White House.

“The only way the Senate or the committee can get those papers now is through my impeachment,” he declared.

The clash over presidential confidentiality grew more intense when Eisenhower ordered his defense secretary not to allow Army officials to testify at hearings by Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) into alleged Communists in the Army. On May 17, 1954, Eisenhower wrote a letter that cited the need for advisers in the executive branch to be in the position “to be completely candid” in providing internal advice.

At a meeting before issuing the letter, Eisenhower said he had tried to stay out of the “damn business on the Hill.” But “I will not allow people around me to be subpoenaed.” McCarthy slammed the action as an “iron curtain,” but it was beginning of the end of his red-baiting hearings.

Eisenhower’s letter didn’t use the words “executive privilege,” but it soon established the practice under that name. The Eisenhower administration used executive privilege a record 44 times, raising concern that the president had too much power. It was Eisenhower’s onetime vice president who changed that perception.

In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon invoked executive privilege as president to try to stop a congressional order to release secret White House recordings that been revealed during Senate Watergate hearings. Nixon argued that “the special nature of tape recordings of private conversations is such that these principles [of executive privilege] apply with even greater force to tapes of private Presidential conversations than to Presidential papers.”

On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Nixon had to turn over the tapes. The justices upheld the right of executive privilege, but they ruled that this privilege couldn’t be used to withhold material sought for a criminal proceeding. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, whom Nixon had appointed, noted the precedent of the decision in the Burr trial that a president was “not above the law.”

“The decision establishes the legal duty of even a President to furnish evidence of what was said in conversations with his closest aides when relevant to the trial of a criminal cause,” wrote former Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

“Nixon went too far when he claimed executive privilege in an attempt to conceal evidence of White House wrongdoing,” said Rozell, the George Mason University dean. “His actions had the consequence of giving executive privilege a bad name.”

The Nixon precedent also turned out to be bad news for President Bill Clinton, who invoked executive privilege 14 times during the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In 1998, a federal judge ruled that Clinton couldn’t use the action to block questioning of his aides about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege six times. President Barack Obama took the action once in 2012, when his Justice Department refused to turn over documents sought by the Republican-controlled House for a “Fast and Furious” program to track guns. A negotiated settlement was reached in court just weeks ago after seven years, an indication of how long such disputes can take if litigated.

Trump’s assertion of executive privilege could wind up being resolved in the courts, as well. How long that takes is anyone’s guess.

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."

Holds Back Documents

Updated at 5:53 p.m. ET

The separation-of-powers standoff between Congress and the executive branch deepened on Wednesday over a dispute about access to materials involving the controversial citizenship question planned for the 2020 census.

The Justice Department notified the House oversight committee that it's withholding documents sought by the panel's chairman because it says they're shielded by executive privilege — the doctrine that permits an administration to conceal some of its internal workings.

The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd arrived electronically at the Capitol at the same time Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had convened a hearing at which the committee debated whether to find Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

After a day's worth of discussion and amendments, it did, voting 24 to 15 by the late afternoon on contempt for the Cabinet officials.

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., who has lately stepped up his criticism of Trump, broke with Republicans to support the measure.

The dispute over documents

Boyd's letter blamed Cummings for the administration's invocation of privilege.

The Justice Department has already provided tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses but nothing is ever enough, officials say — and Democrats' threats of contempt meant these talks can't continue.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said after the Oversight Committee contempt vote made no sense.

""The committee's attempt to define the Department of Justice's good-faith cooperation as 'contempt' defies logic,"" she said. ""Today's action by Chairman Cummings and his committee undermines Congress's credibility with the American people.""

The Justice Department has provided Congress with tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses on the census matter, Kupec said, over months of prior negotiations.

Cummings and the Democrats blame Barr, Ross and the administration for what they've called an effort to ""stonewall"" their investigation.

Critics argue that Trump's administration wants to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to suppress some responses, including those of Latinos, and Democrats say they want unredacted communications to see how the question was discussed inside the government.

""The census is critical to our democracy and our constituents,"" Cummings said. ""We must protect the integrity of the Census, and we must stand up for Congress' authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.

The action in the committee on Wednesday followed a vote by the full House on Tuesday authorizing chairmen such as Cummings to file civil contempt lawsuits in order to try to obtain testimony or evidence.

That's what may happen now following the oversight committee session on Wednesday: Cummings, with the assent of the House leadership, could file suit and ask a judge to order Barr and Ross to provide the census materials he wants.

Republicans have criticized Democrats' litigation strategy as a waste of taxpayer dollars given the court costs involved and also as a dangerous road for the House. If members of Congress file suit but lose, Republicans warn, they could harm the oversight powers of the House over the long term."
DOJ watchdog: FBI lost track of 62 foreign cooperators in U.S.,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/international/448271-doj-watchdog-fbi-lost-track-of-62-foreign-cooperators-in-us,"The FBI lost track of more than 60 foreign cooperators in the U.S. after sponsoring them to aid in investigations, according to a report released Tuesday by the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Office of Inspector General.

In addition, the watchdog's audit identified 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was not provided information on in February 2018. By that August it was still seeking information from DOJ on 665.

While DHS facilitates the cooperators' entries into the U.S., the DOJ takes custody of them once they are in the country.

“We believe that all DOJ components need to improve their execution of the responsibilities integral to the sponsorship programs, including enhancing the policies for monitoring the locations and activities of sponsored foreign nationals and the management information systems used within the program,” the report says.

The 62 people that absconded included both “benign” absconsions by foreign nationals who simply failed to notify their sponsoring agent of a move and “deliberate” ones by people purposely evading law enforcement. The report does not specify how many of each it identified.

The OIG found 22 cases of people who absconded without the DOJ notifying the DHS until a 2018 review.

In another 18 cases, the DOJ let foreign nationals’ sponsorship lapse, which put them at risk for being detained and deported while the DOJ was still using them for investigations, according to the report.

To address such issues going forward, the report states, the DOJ should ensure the DEA and FBI take all necessary steps to help DHS located absconded people, as well as developing compliance processes for DHS reporting requirements.

The department should also “institute a more efficient process to resolve DHS’s existing unresolved sponsorship matters and ensure that any future sponsorship matters needing resolution are addressed expeditiously,” the report states."
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

State Department Defends Saudi Arms Sales Before Hostile House Panel,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Catie Edmondson', 'Edward Wong']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html,"WASHINGTON — A senior State Department official on Wednesday defended the Trump administration’s use of an emergency declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, telling a hostile House committee that holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial rivals in China and Russia.

In a contentious hearing, lawmakers from both parties pressed R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Congress’s will.

Lawmakers are outraged by the decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May to use a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to push through more than $8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries are leading an air war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and thousands of civilian deaths, many of them children. In both chambers, bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales, many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year.

Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr. Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24."
Number of criminal environmental cases referred to DOJ by Interior at nearly 25-year low,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448342-number-of-environmental-criminal-cases-interior-referred-for,"The number of criminal environmental enforcement cases brought by the Interior Department has decreased by nearly 40 percent since 2016, according to internal data shared with The Hill.

Criminal environmental cases that often deal with unlicensed big-game hunting, illegal drug running, or oil and gas theft have all dropped to an almost 25-year low, according to the Interior data.

The tanking case referrals to the Department of Justice (DOJ), prosecutions filed and convictions come as law enforcement officer employment numbers at Interior are also on a downward swing.

Officers within the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Park Service are increasingly stretched thin, with employment numbers at both agencies at an all-time low, according to another set of information shared with The Hill.

The information was obtained by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) through Freedom of Information Act requests obtained personally and through the use of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The number of cases referred by Interior to the DOJ to prosecute in fiscal 2018 stood at 132, down from 154 in 2017 and 216 cases in 2016, Obama’s last year in office. At the height of referrals in 2000, 835 cases were sought.

The number of cases ultimately taken up by the DOJ to convict has also significantly decreased. In 2018, the agency prosecuted 161 cases, the lowest number of cases taken up since 1991, according to the Interior data. The highest number of cases brought in one year was in 2007, with 644 cases prosecuted.

The pattern of shrinking referrals largely aligns with the drop in law enforcement numbers across the agency. Bureaus within the Interior Department have historically witnessed a decrease in full-time law enforcement staff. The effect spans multiple presidencies.

The National Park Service has experienced steady declines in its permanent law enforcement workforce. Rangers dropped by nearly 14 percent between 2005 and 2016, from 1,548 rangers to 1,331, according to internal data.

At the BLM, after a beefing up in ranger numbers in 2009, law enforcement numbers drooped. In 2016 there were 185 rangers within the BLM compared to the high of 224 in 2012. In 2017, the BLM increased ranger numbers to 202.

Jeff Ruch, Pacific PEER director, said the data highlighted the importance of a robust Interior law enforcement crew.

“America’s natural resource heritage is at a growing risk of being looted with fewer cops on the beat inside agencies that are starving by attrition,” Ruch said in a statement.

“While there is growing attention to the infrastructure gap for capital improvements on national parks and other federal lands, we also need to start looking at the escalating human capital needs of these land management agencies.”

Interior did not return a request for comment.

Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in the past year also canceled its permanent dual-function officer law enforcement program at Wildlife Refuges across the U.S. as a way to cut costs.

The department is facing a more than $11 million maintenance backlog, a reality Trump administration officials have pointed to for cuts. Yet the Trump administration's budget proposal released in March suggested cutting funding to Interior by 14 percent."
DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech that low prices or free products won't protect them,https://www.foxnews.com,['Christopher Carbone'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/doj-antitrust-big-tech-low-prices-free-products-wont-protect,"The Justice Department's assistant attorney general highlighted the antitrust case against Silicon Valley's major players during a Tuesday speech.

Makan Delrahim described a range of possible arguments against tech companies as his office takes the lead in probing Google and, possibly, Apple. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is overseeing inquiries into possible antitrust practices of Facebook and Amazon.

After discussing the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the 1982 dissolution of AT&T into the ""Baby Bells"" and the government's successful monopoly case against Microsoft in 2001 – which arguably helped lay the foundation for the success of Google and Yahoo – Delrahim explained several arguments that could be made against the world's most powerful tech companies on antitrust grounds.

Offering Low Prices or Free Services

Critics have pointed out Amazon's undeniable power in the area of American e-commerce and its foray into the world of bricks-and-mortar retail, but the company's defenders note the consistently low prices it offers on a gigantic array of consumer goods. In addition, Facebook and Google offer a multitude of services for free.

WHY IS NANCY PELOSI IGNORING FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG?

But Delrahim said the Justice Department takes a much broader view.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low,"" he said in his speech at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference. ""It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.""

Besides price, ""diminished quality"" is a factor the Justice Department would consider.

""As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection. Moreover, two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,"" Delrahim said.

Exclusive Agreements

Delrahim said the Antitrust Division has a history of investigating ""exclusive conduct"" under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

""[Exclusivity agreements] also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition,"" he said. ""This is true in digital markets as well.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO RADICALIZATION, TOP TWITTER EXEC SAYS

The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft focused in part on that company's inclusion of its own browser in its Windows operating system, which the federal agency found discouraged users from seeking alternatives.

“This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim added.

CREEPY DEEPFAKE AI LETS YOU PUT WORDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH

Swallowing Up Competitors

Facebook and Google have gobbled up hundreds of other companies – some of them former competitors – over the last two decades. Delrahim indicated that this type of behavior could be considered anticompetitive.

“It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality,"" he said. ""Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.”

According to The New York Times, Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades, including YouTube, which was a competitor to Google Video; Waze, which competed with Google Maps; and DoubleClick, which had been the tech giant's chief advertising competitor.

Facebook has acquired 92 companies since 2007, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The Menlo Park, Calif. based company also bought and shut down other social networks, including Gowalla, Beluga and Nextstop, the Times reports.

Still, Delrahim said that acquisitions can be positive if they ""combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise.""

Although these investigations may take years to complete, Delrahim made it clear that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at Silicon Valley's main players.

""While antitrust is not a panacea for every policy challenge presented by the digital market, the Antitrust Division will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anticompetitive conduct and transactions where justified,"" he said. ""That is because where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections.""

At around 2:17 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at 2.08%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down to around 2.597%.

Meanwhile, Wednesday's consumer price index data rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May, while costs excluding volatile energy and food components also rose 0.1%.

Prices climbed 1.8% from the previous year while the so-called core gauge rose 2%, both falling short of economists' expectations.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week and fostered mounting worries that the labor market is losing steam after job growth decelerated in May. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended June 8, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

The Treasury Department auctioned $16 billion in 30-year bonds at a high yield of 2.607%. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.32. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 60.8%. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 15.1%."
President Trump Invoked Executive Privilege. Here's the History of That Presidential Power,https://time.com,['Olivia B. Waxman'],,,,https://time.com/5605930/executive-privilege-history/,"When Congress issues a subpoena for documents, usually they get what they want. But that’s not the case for certain documents related to the 2020 Census question about citizenship, the Department of Justice said on Wednesday in a letter to Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The reason: President Trump is invoking executive privilege.



The committee voted to recommend holding Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoenas — though the committee’s Republicans say that the administration has already provided thousands of pages of relevant documents — but Trump is unlikely to face consequences for failing to comply. That’s because the doctrine of executive privilege, which Trump invoked for the first time in his presidency just a month ago, to block House Judiciary Committee Democrats from seeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s un-redacted report, gives presidents wide leeway to keep secrets.

So what is executive privilege? TIME once summed up the evolution of the concept as: “George Washington invoked it, Dwight Eisenhower named it and Richard Nixon abused it.” Here’s what else to know about the term and how its use has evolved over time.



What is executive privilege?

One oft-cited definition comes from Mark Rozell, author of two books on executive privilege and the Founding Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. He defined executive privilege in a 1998 Minnesota law review article as “the right of the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts and ultimately the public” when it comes to “(1) certain national security needs and (2) protecting the privacy of White House deliberations when it is in the public interest to do so.”

The term “executive privilege” is not in the U.S. Constitution, but it’s considered an implied power based on the separation of powers laid out in Article II, which is meant to make sure one branch of government doesn’t become all-powerful; executive privilege is one way the legislative branch’s power over the executive is limited. For example, when Congress investigated George W. Bush’s firing of eight U.S. Attorneys in 2006, the White House Counsel at the time, Fred Fielding, alluded to executive privilege in a letter referencing the “the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency.” But prominent constitutional law expert Raoul Berger famously called it a “constitutional myth” in his 1974 book, literally entitled Executive Privilege: A Constitutional Myth.

Why do presidents need executive privilege?

The basic idea behind executive privilege is that an entity like the U.S. government requires a lot of transparency, but also can’t function if there’s no possible way to speak about things confidentially.

“All reasonably complicated organizations need some space in which people can discuss what they’re going to do, with some degree of confidentiality. Why? If you know everything you consider is going to made public, or shared in some way, then that’s going to chill your ability to have frank and open discussion,” says Michael Dorf, a constitutional law expert at Cornell Law School. “The early understanding is simply that this is just a logical consequence of separation of powers, that each branch has to be able to assert its powers relative to the other branches.”

Generally, presidents will invoke executive privilege in matters relating to national security, the military and foreign affairs, for example to protect the names of spies and informants.

Who was the first President to invoke executive privilege?

The idea can be traced all the way back to President George Washington, who claimed it in 1792 when Congress asked him to turn over documents related to an unsuccessful military operation against Native Americans, according to Rozell’s report on the history of executive privilege for the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson once wrote that, after conferring with his cabinet members, Washington believed “that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit & ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public.” Washington also claimed it when Congress requested documents related to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty with England, arguing that “the nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy.”

And Jefferson is considered the first president to establish the precedent of only releasing parts of subpoenaed material; when he was subpoenaed by his political rival Chief Justice John Marshall to present documents for the treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr, who was accused of plotting to carve out the Western territories to form an independent republic, Jefferson initially refused to turn over the requested materials. The president must be able, he wrote, to “decide, independently, what papers coming to him as President, the public interest permit to be communicated, & to whom.” Jefferson eventually turned over the papers but maintained that he couldn’t be forced to do so; Burr was acquitted.

“Jefferson says that the court doesn’t have any power to issue this but I’m going to hand it over anyway because I’m a cooperative kind of guy,” says Dorf. “That set a pattern that I think we’ve seen ever since — that the President or members of an administration will cooperate to some degree, but say they’re doing so voluntarily.”

The specific phrase “executive privilege,” however, is more often said to have emerged in the 20th century. President Dwight Eisenhower invoked executive privilege more than 40 times. “Eisenhower took a very strong stand, especially during the McCarthy hearings,” Rozell told TIME in 2007. When Senator Joseph McCarthy demanded that White House officials testify in 1954 about suspected communists, “Eisenhower responded that any man who testifies to Congress about what advice he gave me will not be working for me by nightfall.”

How has executive privilege evolved?

One president who significantly changed the usage of executive privilege was Grover Cleveland, who “almost single-handedly” increased the power of the presidency in “his use of executive privilege in refusing to hand over department files to Congress in the fight over presidential appointments,” wrote Henry F. Graff, Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University.

But Cleveland isn’t the president most people think of when they think of executive privilege. Graff goes on to say as much: “No President prior to Richard M. Nixon had ever made such an extreme assertion of executive privilege in peacetime.”

Though plenty of others have invoked the idea, Nixon remains to this day the president most closely associated with the concept. In fact, the only Supreme Court case on executive privilege is United States v. Nixon (1974), which came about when he claimed executive privilege during the Watergate investigation to get out of a grand jury subpoena and avoid handing over recordings of his conversations in the White House.

In a unanimous decision — meaning that even the conservative justices whom Nixon appointed agreed — the court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes, arguing that presidents can’t just say that material is confidential in order to withhold criminal evidence. Here’s how TIME summarized the key points of the case in the Aug. 5, 1974, issue:

> The court firmly rejected Nixon’s argument that as head of the co-equal Executive Branch of the Government, he was entitled under the Constitution to determine finally the scope of his own privilege. On the contrary, the main theoretical plank of the court‘s opinion was the assertion of its supremacy in all matters of the law. The Judiciary’s power to interpret the law, the decision said, “can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a presidential veto.” Quoting directly from Chief Justice John Marshall’s decision in Marbury v. Madison, the court said, “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is” with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case. > The President’s claims of Executive privilege must give way to the needs of the courts to settle a criminal case. Neither the separation of the Executive and Judicial branches nor the need for confidentiality “can sustain an absolute, unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.” The court found that President Nixon’s claim of Executive privilege was too “broad” and “undifferentiated.” It showed no danger to the nation if the tapes were turned over to Sirica for in camera inspection. “We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.” …[T]he ruling was a narrow one. For one thing, as the President pointed out the day the decision was announced, the court “reaffirmed both the validity and the importance of the principle of Executive privilege.” The court, agreeing that “deference” should be accorded the “President’s need for candor and objectivity from advisers,” stated that the Chief Executive must be assured of confidentiality when discussing policy alternatives. Thus “the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”

Sixteen days after this decision was handed down, Nixon resigned.

Why is executive privilege still controversial?

While the court clearly upheld the idea of executive privilege, scholars say it’s still unclear how the decision applies beyond that particular case, leaving the potential for the idea to be exploited. What is the limit to its use and how will it be enforced are questions that continue to be debated.

Many scholars worried about that problem as soon as U.S. v. Nixon was decided; because Chief Justice Burger had taken care to lay out examples of moments when executive privilege was merited (concerning “military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets”) it seemed possible that future presidents merely had to invoke those ideas to hide whatever information they wanted.

Scholars say there hasn’t been enough case law to clarify whether a congressional investigation can override executive privilege. “Lower courts have tried to avoid the issue but have come down on the side of saying, ‘it’s a balancing test,’ Dorf says. “In the past, whenever possible, courts have tried to avoid making those judgments. So presidents have been very reluctant to assert executive privilege, and then the courts have tried to duck the issue, and they can. But the way things are going now, it looks not likely to be duckable — although you never know.”

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

Treasury Department finalizes rule to stop Democratic states’ tax workaround,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/treasury-department-finalizes-rule-stop-democratic/,"The Treasury Department released its final rules Tuesday outlawing the push by Democrat-led states to undermine the GOP’s new tax law, saying that donating to state-run charities isn’t a substitute for paying federal taxes.

A number of high-tax states had balked after the tax changes President Trump signed in 2017 limited how much state and local taxes could be written off on federal returns.

New York, California and New Jersey all explored new laws allowing residents to make some of their state tax payments as contributions to charities, figuring that would be an end-run around the federal changes, since charitable contributions are still fully deductible.

But the feds said that violated the spirit of the law and they are shutting it down.

They said a longstanding principle of tax law is that someone who gets something of value in exchange for a donation to charity can only deduct the net value of the donation.

The new rule “applies that principle, known as the quid pro quo principle, to state tax benefits provided to a donor in return for contributions,” Treasury said.

That means if someone donated $1,000 to a state charity and the state gives a $700 tax credit for the donation, the taxpayer can only take a federal write-off on the remaining $300, since the taxpayer already got $700 of value.

Rep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat and one of the most vocal critics of the GOP’s tax overhaul, blasted the IRS rules.

“This Trump administration seems to wake up in the morning trying to think up ways to screw my state,” he said, saying the move undermines New Jersey’s workaround.

“This isn’t over,” he vowed.

The IRS had proposed the rules earlier, and Tuesday’s announcement was a finalization of the rule.

Limiting state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $10,000 for a married couple filing jointly was a major part of the GOP’s tax overhaul. While income tax rates were lowered, the new law imposed caps or did away with a number of deductions.

The SALT limits struck particularly hard at wealthier people with expensive homes, who pay high property taxes.

Republicans said high-tax states had been benefitting unfairly, since residents wrote off a larger share of their tax burden. That meant those states were powering their spending at the expense of federal taxpayers.

GOP lawmakers said the answer was for those states to cut their taxes.

The states, though, had other ideas.

Several of them sued, arguing the rules were discriminatory. Some sought the workarounds.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pascrell and other Democrats from those high-tax states rushed to introduce legislation repealing the SALT limits, in a move that would have amounted to a new tax cut for wealthier Americans.

House Dems push Trump to fill high-level Interior vacancies,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448467-house-dems-push-trump-to-fill-high-level-interior-vacancies,"House Democrats are pushing the president to speed up nominations to the Interior Department on the heels of a complaint the agency is temporarily filling roles with existing staff to avoid seeking Senate confirmation.

“Fifty-nine percent of key [Interior] positions have yet to be filled; fewer than half of those vacant even have a nominee awaiting Senate approval,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, wrote in a letter to President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel OKs space military branch Harris calls Trump 'a national security threat' after he says he'd take information from foreign power Harris calls Trump 'a national security threat' after he says he'd take information from foreign power MORE.

“Your administration is abdicating its constitutional duty to nominate qualified individuals into these important roles, instead enlisting individuals in an acting capacity who are more loyal to a political agenda than the missions of the agencies and departments they should be leading,” the letter said.

The administration has numerous vacancies in high-level positions across multiple departments and agencies.

Grijalva’s letter outlines a long list of positions that have gone unfilled at Interior, ranging from the deputy of the department to agency heads that oversee offshore oil and gas leasing, land management and mining.

On Tuesday, an ethics group filed a complaint with the agency's Office of Inspector General, saying the department had shuffled controversial employees into roles using steps that avoid Senate confirmation.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility argued the agency is violating federal law on vacancies by “temporarily redelegating” roles to existing employees for the 27th time under the Trump administration.

A May 23 order from Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was the latest example of the maneuver.

Grijalva asked the administration to produce a detailed timeline of when they plan to make nominations for the numerous vacancies."
President Donald Trump Reveals First Design Mock-Up of New Air Force One,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-06-13/president-donald-trump-reveals-first-design-mock-up-of-new-air-force-one,"President Donald Trump shared never-before-seen photos of the proposed redesign of Air Force One.

The president showed the mock-ups to ABC News as part of an interview that aired Thursday and said he designed them himself. The new designs feature an American flag on the tail of the plane with a red, white and blue design along the body.

Trump announced he would redesign Air Force One about a year ago, saying the planes were outdated. He said he would do away with the iconic baby blue color scheme, which date back to President John F. Kennedy's administration, and design the planes to be more patriotic

In July, it was announced that Boeing Co. was awarded a $3.9 billion contract to manufacture two 757-8 aircraft to serve as the new Air Force One. Trump told ABC that the new planes are ""a 747, but … it's a much bigger plane"" with a larger wingspan.

The reveal comes after lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to restrict spending on renovation plans, ABC reported.

Although the term Air Force One can be used to describe any Air Force aircraft carrying the commander in chief, it typically refers to one of two highly modified and customized Boeing 747-200B series planes.

The 4,000-square foot aircraft include a presidential suite, medical operating room and a large kitchen, ABC reported.

The president said the new aircraft will come with new features and ""a couple of secrets."" The new planes will not be ready until 2024.

Homeland Security’s Jeanette Manfra is coming to Disrupt SF – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/jeanette-manfra-disrupt-sf/,"We can’t talk cybersecurity without hearing from the government.

We’re thrilled to announce Homeland Security Assistant Director Jeanette Manfra, a senior executive at the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will be at Disrupt SF.

Manfra is one of the federal government’s most experienced cybersecurity civil servants. She currently leads CISA’s cybersecurity efforts in protecting and strengthening the country’s most important infrastructure, like the power grid and water supplies. A decade-long government career professional, she previously served as acting deputy under secretary for cybersecurity at the National Protection and Programs Directorate, a division of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting government networks and critical infrastructure, later absorbed by CISA after the agency was created by President Trump in November 2018.

Prior to Homeland Security, Manfra served in the U.S. Army as a communications specialist and a military intelligence officer.

For years, cybersecurity warfare was somewhat limited to governments attacking governments. But the threat landscape has changed, and the new battleground is both in government and in the private sector.

Now under one roof, CISA acts as the nation’s cybersecurity risk adviser — working closely with government departments to protect federal systems and networks, and private industry to advise and warn on ongoing and emerging threats.

The agency has recently doubled down on its efforts to ensure election security, as well as risks to the U.S. supply chain.

Cybersecurity is one of those universal topics that affects every consumer, business, enterprise and government. We’re excited to talk shop with Manfra about the state of the security union.

Disrupt SF is in San Francisco on October 2-4; tickets are available here."

Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Annie Snider', 'Zack Colman']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/11/bernhardt-interior-glenwood-springs-mining-1462726,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo energy & environment Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Story Continued Below

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.



The hilltop mine leases land owned by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"
Cheaper summer gas in Allegheny County continues as EPA extends fuel waiver,https://triblive.com,['Jacob Tierney'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/cheaper-summer-gas-in-allegheny-could-be-here-to-stay-as-epa-extends-waiver/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency has extended an emergency waiver that will keep gas costs lower in Allegheny County.

State and federal regulations have long required the county to sell a low-polluting, more expensive blend of gas during the summer.

However, due to damage to the Buckeye Partners Laurel Products Pipeline, the federal Environmental Protection Agency last month waived this requirement until June 17 because of fuel shortage concerns.

On Wednesday the EPA issued an extension until July 1.

The cross-state pipeline was damaged May 20 after a release of water near Pittsburgh during scheduled maintenance and testing, according to the company.

Meanwhile, Allegheny County is on the brink of removing the summer gas requirement entirely. Since modern cars don’t pollute as much as older models, state officials saw the regulation as no longer necessary.

Last year the state and EPA lifted the requirement for Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

The change is taking longer in Allegheny County, which has to go through extra steps because it manages its own air quality program.

The county and state have moved to repeal the regulation, and the EPA has tentatively agreed, but required an in-depth analysis to prove the change would not add pollution to the county.

The agency is expected to issue its final ruling this month.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) (Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

For the second time this year, workers at a science division of the Agriculture Department voted overwhelmingly to unionize in apparent revolt against the administration’s plan to relocate them from Washington, D.C., to a yet-to-be-announced location.

On Tuesday, employees at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which distributes $400 million in competitive grants to researchers around the country each year, voted 137 to 2 to be represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union. In May, the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency also included in the relocation, voted 138 to 4 to unionize with AFGE.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement distributed to reporters before the votes were counted. In August, Perdue announced the relocation as a cost-saving measure that would move scientists closer to those they serve, a claim critics dispute.

In early May, USDA announced that Kansas City, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and the state of Indiana had been selected as the leading candidates for relocation sites. The department has not said when it would make a final decision. “I truly believe that the relocation of ERS and NIFA will help to fulfill USDA’s commitment to be the most effective, most efficient and most customer-focused agency in the federal government,” Perdue said in the statement.

But former USDA officials and leaders in the agricultural community argue the relocation will paralyze the agencies, and have also warned that this proposal is an attempt to weaken the influence of scientists under the Trump administration.

Members of Congress were divided largely along partisan lines. At an Agriculture Committee hearing last week, Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the secretary “has broad support to move forward with this decision.” But Democrats in both chambers have introduced legislation to block the move, and they dispute whether the secretary has the authority to relocate the offices without congressional approval.

Peter Winch, a union organizer for AFGE, said that the newly formed union would ask the department to allow employees to visit the proposed relocation site and to give them more than 30 days to respond to reassignment letters.

The unionization vote comes as the Trump administration has taken a confrontational approach toward federal employees and their unions with executive orders, new policies creating a faster path to firing and tough stances at the bargaining table.

At a rally on Tuesday morning, about a dozen NIFA and ERS employees waved American flags and handed out pro-union stickers. Unionization would “delay changes to working conditions” and offer “protection from political interference,” according to the fliers they distributed. Those who spoke to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared professional repercussions. Many employees are applying for new jobs in the District, and few said that they would consider relocating.

A senior NIFA employee said that the push to unionize “would never have happened without the secretary of agriculture.” Another lamented the absence of a USDA chief scientist, who in previous administrations had been the voice of scientists in the department.

A third employee said the workload — the number of grant awards to be processed — has quadrupled due to high attrition and the lasting effects of the federal government shutdown this winter. NIFA’s $1.7 billion budget supports cutting-edge research as well as rural communities and programs like 4-H. “The mission still has to be done,” the person said, but the “morale is not great.”

Inside the NIFA office building, workers waited for up to an hour to vote. Three-quarters of NIFA employees eligible to cast a ballot did so. About 30 people watched as an official from the Federal Labor Relations Authority counted the votes. NIFA employees cheered when the final tally was announced.

“Waiting for the department to give us a voice was not going to happen,” the senior NIFA employee said. The relocation process, which has “generated considerable frustration,” the person said, “provided a lot of motivation for employees to form a union in order to have a voice.”

The administration has argued that its pro-management policies are an effort to make government and its employees more efficient and able to serve the public. But the actions have created anxiety in federal offices and resulted in court challenges.

Last year, a federal judge shot down the bulk of three White House executive orders that were designed to bring a pro-management atmosphere to federal offices.

Among the toughest provisions was a drastic cut to what is known as official time, legally mandated spans that union officials spend on the clock representing their members in grievances and other disputes. The executive orders also sought to make it easier for managers to fire poor performers.

The judge’s ruling is on appeal, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the administration has worked around the constraints of the court ruling at the bargaining table.

EPA: No plans to order cleanup at Coakley landfill,https://www.seacoastonline.com,"['Jeff Mcmenemy', 'Jeff Mcmenemy Jmcmenemy Seacoastonline.Com']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190612/epa-no-plans-to-order-cleanup-at-coakley-landfill,"GREENLAND�� A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Agency said there are no immediate plans for the agency to order the Coakley Landfill Group to clean up contaminated water at the Superfund dump.

Kelsey Dumville, a senior community involvement coordinator for the EPA�s Boston Public Affairs Office, acknowledged this week that high levels of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane have been found in multiple monitoring wells at the now closed dump in Greenland and North Hampton. Both chemicals are suspected carcinogens.

There�s also been high levels of PFAS found in surface water in the nearby Berry�s Brook, the headwaters of which are adjacent the Superfund cleanup site.

�As far as PFAS and 1,4-dioxane within the scope of the site, it�s not moving offsite and it�s not impacting people,� Dumville said. �We don�t necessarily conduct treatment if there�s chemicals within the landfill.�

She said there have been other Superfund sites in the United States that have chemicals within the site that have not been treated. Asked if it were theoretically possible that the contamination on site could stay in Coakley forever, she said, �Yes, but EPA will continue to monitor it, that�s part of the Superfund process.�

Dumville stated several times this week that �it�s important to note like we have that nobody in the area is drinking contaminated water as a result of the landfill.�

But the CLG in 2018 was ordered to install private water treatment systems at a home and the Breakfast Hill Golf Course after 1,4-dioxane was found at both locations above the state�s new health standards. Before that, people in the home and at the golf course were exposed to 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA�s website describes as �a likely human carcinogen.�

�It is highly mobile and does not readily biodegrade in the environment,� an EPA fact sheet states about the chemical.

Dumville�s comments this week came after the EPA announced it will hold a public meeting on the Coakley landfill from 6 to 8 p.m. June 25 at the Bethany Church in Greenland.

The EPA�s Office of the Inspector General got an earful at its �listening session� last week in Greenland. Several speakers blasted the EPA for what they saw as its failure to force the Coakley Landfill Group (CLG) to clean up the toxic Superfund site. Others criticized the EPA for failing to respond nationally to PFAS contamination.

The CLG includes municipalities and private companies that used the dump. Portsmouth is responsible for the largest share of the remediation at 53.6%. The landfill accepted waste from 1972 to 1982 and then incinerator waste until 1985. It was capped in 1998.

Many people living around the landfill are concerned a plume of chemicals, including PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, will migrate from the site and contaminate their drinking water wells.

Mindi Messmer is an environmental scientist and former state representative who advocates for people living around the landfill to have access to safe, clean municipal water. She said it is �highly irresponsible� that the EPA does not have a plan to clean up the contaminated groundwater at Coakley.

�It is not acceptable for there to be no plan to deal with that,� Messmer said Tuesday.

She noted New Hampshire and other states are looking at setting �much more stringent� standards for PFAS chemicals �than the EPA has.� The EPA set a permanent health advisory for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at a combined 70 parts per trillion.

PFAS are man-made chemicals used in products worldwide since the 1950s, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and water-repellent fabrics. They also have a range of applications in the aerospace, aviation, automotive and electronics industries, among others. The Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states studies have shown PFAS exposure can increase cancer risks, lower birth weights, harm liver, thyroid and pancreas functions and increase cholesterol levels.

Messmer said despite the EPA�s assurances �there are people right now living near Coakley who are drinking water with higher levels of PFAS than other states say is safe. It�s irresponsible for the federal government to let these people pollute the environment and not have to clean it up.""

Former Portsmouth Mayor Eric Spear is chair of the CLG�s executive committee. He acknowledged there are high levels of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane in monitoring wells but only within the landfill�s boundaries. Asked when they would be cleaned up, Spear said, �At the end of the day, the task for the CLG like all Superfund groups is to fully cleanup the site.�

But it is up to the EPA how and when that cleanup will occur, he stressed. �We have to follow the EPA�s directives,� Spear said Wednesday.

�I think the number one mission for the CLG in the near term being certainly the next five years, our mission is to make sure that we�re following the dictates of the EPA so we protect public health,� Spear said.

He added he believes the network of monitoring wells will alert them if there�s any future migration of chemicals. �If you look at the map of the monitoring wells we have in place, we�re completely surrounded,� Spear said. �Everyone knows these chemicals are bad, that�s why they�re being monitored.�

�I think it�s unhelpful to create a lot of fear unnecessarily when the situation is being closely monitored,� he added.

Spear said he will attend the June 25 meeting in Greenland."
Justice Department backs parents suing Maine over tuition for religious schools,https://www.pressherald.com,"['Follow On Twitter', 'Email Writer']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/11/doj-expresses-support-for-plaintiffs-in-maine-religious-school-tuition-case/,"The U.S. Department of Justice has thrown its support behind a small group of Maine parents who have filed a federal lawsuit seeking reimbursement for their children’s religious school tuition.

The department filed a “letter of interest” in U.S. District Court in Portland on Monday expressing its opinion about the Maine case, Carson v. Makin. It sided strongly with the plaintiffs, citing DOJ guidance that “government may not target persons or individuals because of their religion,” and “individuals do not give up their religious-liberty protections by providing or receiving social services, education or healthcare.”

Related Headlines Families’ lawsuit challenges Maine law against public funding for religious schools

Three married couples in central Maine filed the lawsuit in August 2018 against the state Department of Education over a decades-old Maine law that bars tuition reimbursements for religious schools. Oral arguments in the lawsuit are scheduled for June 24 at the federal courthouse in Portland.

Local school administrative units in Maine that do not have their own secondary schools can pay a certain amount in tuition for students to attend outside public or private schools. But that money cannot be used at religious schools, a policy that the parents’ legal complaint calls discriminatory and unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs, led by Glenburn residents David and Amy Carson, are represented by two national groups that describe themselves as advocates for religious liberty and school choice. The lawsuit comes at a time when the Trump administration has made the push for alternatives to public schools central to the national education policy debate.

DOJ spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in an email that the protection of religious freedom is a top priority for the department.

In July 2018, the DOJ announced the formation of the Religious Liberty Task Force, which brings together department components to coordinate their work on religious freedom litigation and policy, and to implement former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ 2017 religious liberty guidance, Laco said.

“That guidance was issued at the direction of President Trump’s May 4, 2017, executive order promoting free speech and religious liberty,” she said.

Laco did not respond to a follow-up email asking if the Department of Justice plans to get involved further in the case, such as by participating in oral arguments.

Zachary Heiden, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said his organization joined the case as a “friend of the court” arguing in favor of upholding the state’s ban on tuition reimbursement for religious schools.

Heiden said he has read the DOJ’s letter and found that its legal arguments primarily echo those made by the plaintiffs in their original complaint. He said it’s not unusual for the department to file a letter of interest in a case in which it has an opinion.

“This is what they do,” Heiden said. “This is one of the ways in which the Department of Justice does its job.”

He said the impact of the lawsuit’s outcome will be limited in scope because the existing law only applies to certain small communities in Maine. However, it could be used as precedent in other related cases.

Heiden believes the plaintiffs have an uphill battle. The same state law has been challenged four times in various state and federal courts, he said, and in all four cases the plaintiffs have lost.

“Those courts have always said that this Maine law is constitutional, is permissible,” Heiden said. “That law hasn’t changed. The First Amendment hasn’t changed. So it would be quite significant for the court to now say that, actually, the Maine law violates the Constitution.”

More than 30 states have constitutional amendments that prohibit state funding of religious organizations, including schools. Though Maine is not one of them, it passed a law in 1981 that bars public funding for sectarian schools. Legislative efforts to expand school choice and give taxpayer money to religious schools have failed to gain traction in recent years.

One of the groups representing the plaintiffs in Carson v. Makin, the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian public-interest law firm, has said it decided to challenge the Maine law again in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2017.

In that case, Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri was barred from participating in a state program that reimburses the cost of rubberizing playground surfaces. The nation’s highest court ultimately decided the church should be eligible for that public funding. Advocates for public funding of religious schools hope that case will serve as legal precedent to advance their own interests.

But Heiden said he doesn’t see a strong connection between the Missouri case and the one in Maine.

“I disagree with their interpretation of that (Missouri) case,” he said. “It’s about … shredded rubber tires on playground surfaces, which I don’t think is the same thing as funding education. But obviously the DOJ has a different interpretation of that.”

House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
USDA Cuts Projections for Corn Production to Four-Year Low After Wet Planting Season,https://www.wsj.com,['Kirk Maltais'],,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/usda-cuts-projections-for-corn-production-to-four-year-low-after-wet-planting-season-11560278067,"A key monthly report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Tuesday the damage done by heavy rainfall in the Corn Belt, reducing expected corn production to its lowest in four years.

The wet weather this year prevented farmers from planting the crop on time, and the Agriculture Department cut its corn-production estimate to 13.68 billion bushels, down 9% from its May forecast.

“U.S. corn production [came in] well below the range of guesses as the reality of the situation is setting in,” said Doug Bergman, director of the agricultural desk at RCM Alternatives.

The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report also marked down predictions for inventories for the 2019-20 marketing year by nearly a third, pegging leftover corn at 1.6 billion bushels.

The WASDE is a monthly report released by the Agriculture Department that includes official statistics for supply and demand for crops grown in the U.S. and world-wide. Investors looked to the report for insight following the devastation from storms and flooding inflicted on the U.S. Midwest in the past month.

Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade soared, with the July contract rising as high as 3.3% to just under $4.30 a bushel, close to a year-high reached May 29. The corn contract had been trading down 1.5% before the report’s release.

U.S. Commodities President Don Roose called the supply-side cuts to corn “whopping.”

“The government is trying to send a signal that we have big issues out here,” Mr. Roose said.

Crop yields per acre, expected to be a new subject of intense speculation by traders over the summer, were estimated at 166 bushels an acre for corn, down 10 bushels an acre from the Agriculture Department’s forecast last month.

The WASDE data follow Monday’s crop progress report from the Agriculture Department, in which corn acres nationwide were 83% planted versus an average of 99% for this time of year, and soybeans were 60% planted versus 88% last year.

Followers of the grains market will get a better picture of the amount of corn acres planted and harvested when the Agriculture Department releases its acreage report on June 28. In it, the agency is expected to go into more detail with its indications of corn acres planted and expected to be harvested.

“Congress has a constitutional obligation to conduct oversight of the executive branch, so I am placing a hold on Treasury Department nominees,"" Wyden said in a statement, which came two weeks after he had threatened to place the hold.

In particular, Wyden said that Brent McIntosh, Trump's nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, should not receive a hearing until Wyden receives answers to his information requests.

McIntosh is currently general counsel for Treasury, and his office has been involved in discussions about the request for Trump's tax returns.

""Mr. McIntosh was central to the Treasury Department’s decision making and without additional context on the process, committee members will not be able to ask informed questions,"" Wyden said.

Both Neal and Mnuchin expect the dispute to eventually be resolved in the courts.

Wyden in May sent letters to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, asking them about Treasury and IRS communications related to Neal's request, including communications made before Neal's initial request in anticipation of it. Earlier this month, Wyden sent another letter to Rettig, asking for information about a draft IRS memo prepared last fall that found that the agency had to comply with congressional tax committees' requests for returns unless executive privilege was invoked.

Treasury responded to Wyden's May letter to the department by saying that Neal's request was different than past congressional requests for tax returns, and by sending Wyden copies of Mnuchin's past correspondence with Neal and an annual report that the IRS prepares for the Joint Committee on Taxation about requests for tax return information. The IRS did not respond to Wyden's June 4 letter to the agency by the senator's June 11 deadline.

“In letters to Secretary Mnuchin and Commissioner Rettig, I asked a number of questions about compliance with congressional requests for tax return information. They included basic inquiries about whether the treasury secretary has been involved in compliance before and when political appointees learned of a memo prepared in advance of an expected congressional request for tax return information,"" Wyden said in a statement. ""I have received non-answers or no response at all, which is completely unacceptable.""

Wyden had also put a hold on Trump Treasury nominees in the past because he felt like the department was stonewalling his information requests.

For example, he had put a hold on Trump's nomination of Justin Muzinich to be deputy Treasury Secretary last summer but then lifted that hold in November after Treasury cooperated with several of his information requests. Muzinich was confirmed in December on a mostly party-line vote."
"Former Bush, Reagan EPA heads caution on Trump rollbacks",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national-politics/former-bush-reagan-epa-heads-caution-on-trump-rollbacks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Environmental Protection Agency heads under three previous Republican presidents joined their Democratic counterparts Tuesday in telling lawmakers they were concerned with the Trump administration's rapid rollbacks of environmental protections.

""The EPA on the track it's on ... is endangering public health,"" Christine Todd Whitman, EPA administrator under George W. Bush, told the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee. Whitman said she was ""deeply concerned that five decades of environmental progress are at risk because of the attitudes and approach of this administration.""

Lee Thomas and William K. Reilly, EPA chiefs under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, respectively, also spoke, as did Obama-era EPA leader Gina McCarthy. The unusual testimony came after seven of the still-living former leaders of the 49-year-old agency signed a letter urging lawmakers to work to make the EPA focus on its mission of protecting public health and the environment.

""I've never seen a situation where three Republicans and one Democrat come in and sound the alarm the way they have today,"" subcommittee Chairwoman Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, said after the hearing.

Much of the criticisms from the former EPA heads focused on perceptions that the Trump administration was focusing on economic and financial interests, sidelining or rejecting science and minimizing environmental and health effects in moving to ease dozens of environmental regulations.

Asked for reaction, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said current EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler was working to engage the agency's Science Advisory Board, or SAB.

""Administrator Wheeler will continue to work with the SAB and try to improve relations that the previous administration took for granted,"" Abboud said.

Abboud did not immediately comment on the broader criticisms. While his predecessors were testifying, however, Wheeler tweeted that the agency was balancing ""our regulations to ensure a healthy and safe environment while also saving the taxpayer $3.6 billion. And we're just getting started.""

With his comment, Wheeler tweeted a Washington Examiner article that quoted him as saying he had saved taxpayers that amount by rolling back 40 ""major regulations, and plans to axe another 49.""

Republicans on the subcommittee did not join the former EPA heads or Democratic lawmakers in expressing alarm at the rollbacks, most of which have targeted Obama-era measures on air, water, pesticides and other threats, and climate change.

Republicans instead said the EPA under past presidents had grown uncommunicative or adversarial with businesses and ordinary people. ""Under your leadership, I think the EPA went rogue,"" Rep. David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, told McCarthy.

During the regulation-cutting Reagan administration, Thomas told lawmakers, congressional oversight and unending press coverage of EPA changes would be enough to get the president himself to step in and make sure the agency was still following its mission of protecting public health and the environment.

There was sometimes the perception that when it came to the EPA, it was ""jobs vs. the environment,"" Thomas said after the hearing. ""There's been fifty years of history that says that's not the tradeoff."""
