Donald Trump can't just 'hereby order' whatever he wants,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/politics/hereby-order-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump has a lot of power to make things happen in this country. He can move economic markets with a single tweet. He can destroy a Republican's political career on a whim (see ""Flake, Jeff""). He can declare national emergencies -- even if they aren't actual national emergencies.

But being president does have its limits. The job is president, not dictator, after all.

""Our Country has lost, stupidly, Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year, & they want to continue. I won't let that happen! We don't need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them. The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing our companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China's Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States. Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn't. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!""

The language Trump used sounds pretty official, right? ""Hereby ordered!"" It makes me think of a king reading a proclamation off of a long scroll!

Powell Highlights Fed’s Limits. Trump Labels Him an ‘Enemy’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeanna Smialek'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/business/powell-fed-interest-rates-trump.html,"“Trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States,” Mr. Powell said, adding that there were “no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.”

His comments followed Beijing’s announcement on Friday that China would retaliate against the Trump administration’s next round of tariffs by increasing taxes on $75 billion of American imports, including agricultural products, crude oil and cars. Both countries plan to increase their levies in September and December, which could exacerbate the economic harm from a trade war that is already causing financial pain across the globe.

They also come as trade tensions, and not just those created by Mr. Trump, threaten growth abroad. Mark Carney, who heads the Bank of England, said in a Jackson Hole speech that the threat of an unruly Brexit looms large for his domestic economy.

“In recent weeks, the perceived likelihood of No Deal has risen sharply,” he said. “In my view, the appropriate policy path would be more likely to ease than not” if that should happen, though the right approach would hinge on the details.

Mr. Carney also said that slower global growth “reflects a significant spike in economic policy uncertainty and the related risk that protectionism could prove more pervasive, persistent and damaging than previously expected.” He said that could leave central bankers with less monetary policy ammunition than they already have.

In the United States, Mr. Powell noted that the period since the Fed’s last meeting, on July 31, “have been eventful.” The day after that meeting, Mr. Trump announced that the country would tax another $300 billion in Chinese products. Since then, further evidence of a global slowdown has emerged and financial markets have reacted to the “complex, turbulent picture,” Mr. Powell noted.

He said that policymakers were “carefully watching developments” as they assessed the implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy, and maintained an earlier pledge to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.”"

President Donald Trump heads into the G-7 summit in coastal France more isolated than ever — and perhaps never more in need of the international coordination he has repeatedly assailed.

The president faces warnings of a U.S. economic downturn driven partly by his fractious trade negotiations with China. He blames other countries' trade policies for mounting economic risks in the U.S., even as many of those countries teeter on the edge of recession. And Trump is expected to spend his time in southern France urging fellow leaders to follow his lead rather than changing course himself.

Trump administration officials said the president is heading to Biarritz this weekend with resolve to tackle common global economic challenges — even as they continue to downplay fears of a U.S. economic slump around the corner.

“The great advantage of the G-7 is that these are challenges that are collectively shared by the world’s most advanced industrialized economies, and they can really dig in and come up with … solutions,” a senior administration official told reporters, adding that the U.S. specifically requested a session on the “global economy” at the summit.

The problem is, Trump has rarely embraced global governance and many economists blame his “America First” approach for propelling the widespread sense of economic uncertainty rippling across the globe.

“Each of these global meetings has become more adversarial,” said a former senior administration official, who cited the president pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Iran deal as top-line ways in which Trump has blown up the global order.

“That’s the consequence of the president’s non-orthodox approach: In general, America is more isolated,” the former official said.

Ever unpredictable, Trump adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude that blew up last year’s gathering of G-7 countries in Canada, distanced himself from European leaders in Paris at a World War I centennial commemoration last fall, and injected chaos into the G-20 summit in Japan this summer. In between those international gatherings, he launched Twitter broadsides against the since-removed British ambassador to the U.S., threatened to slap tariffs on French wine after the country enacted its digital services tax, and recently criticized European allies over what he views as inadequate contributions to NATO.

“G-7 summits have turned into a bit of a nightmare for all concerned and chances are this one could be especially terrible,” said Richard Gowan, an expert on multilateralism at the International Crisis Group.

The G-7 and G-20 became critical forums over the past decade for the world's leading economies to confront ballooning crises. Their coordinated message and shared action in 2009 helped calm markets in the depths of the global financial crisis and spur a global economic recovery. Leaders used the gatherings in the years that followed to tackle the rockiest stages of the European debt crisis.

Trump’s animus toward international bodies, combined with his protectionist vision on trade, “means it’s really hard to see him having the sort of constructive private conversations that in its early days the G-7 was meant to foster,” Gowan said.

Trump heads into this round of G-7 meetings as the odd man out — breaking from long-standing norms for how advanced nations conduct economic policy.

“The great irony is that if other countries took the approach we did, they would be racking up huge deficits and politicizing the central bank,” said Douglas Rediker, a senior nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution.

“If everyone were to emulate U.S. policy, then you would have a race to the bottom,” Rediker said.

President Trump and other leaders attend the Gender Equality Advisory Council working breakfast on the second day of the G7 Summit on June 9, 2018 in Quebec City, Canada.

The White House’s message heading into the G-7 remains as #MAGA as ever — with plans to tout the administration’s policies of tax cuts and deregulation as the panacea to other countries’ policy ills. The administration wants to urge other countries to follow the same path, or “bend to Trump’s will,” as one administration official put it.

“What the U.S. pushed for, while I was at the White House, was for countries to take actions to deal with their economic problems and to promote pro-growth economic policies — tax cuts and deregulation among other things. I think they will push that quite hard this weekend,” said Clete Willems, the former deputy assistant to the president for international economics in the Trump White House who is now a partner at Akin Gump.

Trump, who remains diametrically opposed to many of the positions held by his European counterparts on trade, has said he does not intend to back away from his policies, including his aggressive stance on China, which could drag American businesses and consumers into a painful recession.

A second administration official on Thursday said the G-7 has proven it is unable “to cope with actors like China coming onto the scene,” despite Trump’s purported efforts to rein in Beijing.

“It’s about time, whether it’s good for our country or bad for our country short term. … The fact is somebody had to take China on,” Trump told reporters this week.

His comments came amid growing evidence of trouble for other industrialized economies beyond the United States. Germany‘s central bank warned this week that its economy could shrink again in the third quarter — starting a recession — and much of the country’s economic slowdown has been attributed to the U.S.-China trade war, which has reduced Chinese demand for German imports.

“It seems like he is setting up a real challenge to the European Union’s economy and all this is going to do is continue to deteriorate his own economic outlook for his reelection,” said Heather Conley, Europe program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Trump administration officials don’t see it that way. And they say the G-7 meeting's agenda is full of potential land mines that are squarely aimed at baiting Trump.

A number of Trump appointees “think the whole G-7 agenda is an anti-U.S. agenda,” one person familiar with the concerns said.

Another U.S. official said Trump is already planning to confront French President Emmanuel Macron over the “highly discriminatory” 3 percent tax that France imposed on digital services revenues last month. In the conference call with reporters Thursday, administration officials said overtaxing tech would be framed as “counterproductive.”

Trump’s willingness to disagree with G-7 leaders on areas in which they once shared consensus has already had a notable impact ahead of the summit: Macron, who is hosting this year’s summit, confirmed Wednesday that he will skip the joint communiqué that has followed each G-7 meeting since 1975.

“I know the points of disagreement with the U.S. If we draft an agreement about the Paris [climate] accord, President Trump won’t agree. It’s pointless,” Macron said. (Trump suddenly withdrew his endorsement of the collective statement last year, citing frustrations with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his position on tariffs.)

Removing the communiqué from this year’s G-7 summit — which includes the U.S., France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom — is still unlikely to prevent disagreements from boiling over.

In a preview of what’s to come, administration officials said Trump plans to engage in blunt conversations with America’s European allies on trade and “multilateral reform.” He’s expected to highlight his administration’s recent attempt to modernize the World Trade Organization and to push for the removal of trade barriers that he claims have affected U.S. agriculture and other industries.

Trump will participate in five main sessions — including topics as varied as gender inequality, climate change and digital transformation — in addition to bilateral breakouts with his fellow G-7 leaders. Senior administration officials say the president is looking forward to those meetings, yet few expect the sessions will yield anything of substance.

One of those sit-downs will be with newly appointed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — the first time Trump and Johnson will meet face to face as leaders. They've spoken by phone four times since Johnson moved into No. 10 Downing and a White House official suggested Trump might launch a charm offensive to bring Johnson closer to his side on trade, climate change and Iran.

“There’s likely going to be a lot of sniping amongst the European participants over Brexit and obviously that creates the risk that Trump is going to speak up for Johnson,” Gowan said. “That could cause Johnson to run into a bit of a car crash with [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel or Macron.” Johnson faces his own dangerous task of navigating Britain’s exit from the EU for which he has set a deadline of the end of October.

Less probable, but still being discussed among administration officials, is the possibility that Trump finalizes a partial trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the summit. An agreement that reinforces the president’s disruptive trade policies could bring minor relief to an otherwise tense three days in France, the White House official said. The president’s top trade adviser Robert Lighthizer met with Japan’s economy minister in Washington this week, after which the Japanese official said both sides “agreed to speed up discussions and work on the remaining issues for an early achievement of results.”

The summit in Biarritz begins Saturday evening with a welcome dinner hosted by Macron, and runs until Monday afternoon, when Trump is slated to host a press conference. The president is expected to be accompanied by National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Lighthizer.

MORE and Peter Strzok — failed to pursue access to “highly classified” evidence that could have resolved important questions.

The failure to look at the evidence back in 2016 occurred even though the agents believed access to the sensitive evidence was “necessary” to complete the investigation into Clinton’s improper transmission of classified emails — some top-secret — on her unsecure private email server, the memos show.

To make matters worse, the Trump Department of Justice (DOJ) has known about that decision since at least 2018, thanks to the work of the DOJ’s internal watchdog, Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who provided DOJ leaders and Congress with a classified appendix explaining what happened.

But Johnson and Grassley have been unable to get answers for a year, even from Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrThe road not taken: Another FBI failure involving the Clintons surfaces Correctional officers subpoenaed in Epstein investigation: report Nadler asks other House chairs to provide records that would help panel in making impeachment decision MORE, about whether the FBI intends to look at the critical evidence it skipped back in 2016.

The Senate staff memo succinctly lays out just how egregious the FBI’s decision was in 2016.

The inspector general’s “appendix raised a number of serious questions because, as explained on page 154 of the unclassified DOJ IG report, the FBI decided not to seek access to certain highly classified information potentially relevant to the investigation despite members of the FBI case team referring to the review as a ‘necessary’ part of the investigation,” the Senate staff wrote.

“As a result of the findings in that appendix, Senator Grassley wrote a classified letter to DOJ on October 17, 2018, which remains unanswered. On January 15, 2019, at Mr. Barr’s nomination hearing, Senator Grassley asked Mr. Barr if he would answer the letter, if confirmed, to which he attested, ‘Yes, Senator.’ On April 16, 2019, Senators Grassley, Johnson, and Graham sent a letter to Attorney General Barr reiterating the need for a written response to that letter.""

The DOJ’s silence on the road that the FBI willfully chose not to take is all the more deafening given what we already know about the Clinton email case.

As I previously wrote, then-FBI Director Comey’s original draft findings in the Clinton case concluded her transmission of classified emails through an unsecure server was “grossly negligent,” the legal standard supporting a felony charge under the Espionage Act.

But the findings were edited and the term changed to “extremely careless,” and Comey chose on his own to announce on July 5, 2016, that he would not seek criminal charges, a decision that the DOJ's IG concluded had wrongly usurped prosecutors’ authority to make charging decisions.

In addition, as I have written, FBI general counsel James Baker believed — almost until the last minute before Comey’s announcement — that Clinton should, in fact, face criminal prosecution, but he was talked out of it.

And in a passage that often gets overlooked by reporters and pundits alike, IG Horowitz concluded in his final report about the Clinton email caper that the anti-Trump biases that FBI agent Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page expressed in text messages may have affected their decisionmaking to focus more urgently on the now disproven Trump-Russia collusion allegations rather than to finish work on the former secretary of State’s email problems, an investigation code-named Midyear.

“In assessing the decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead ... we were particularly concerned about text messages sent by Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions they made were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the Justice Department's watchdog wrote.

So the FBI’s chief lawyer originally thought Clinton should be indicted, and the bureau wrote a draft supporting the felony standard, but then walked back its decision. And agents focused more on unsubstantiated Trump collusion than Clinton emails in what the IG feared might be a sign of bias.

And now we learn the FBI willfully chose to ignore highly classified evidence in the Clinton email case and has stonewalled Congress for a year on whether it intends to reexamine that evidence.

It’s exactly that sort of behavior that leaves many Americans wondering whether there are two systems of justice inside the FBI — one for the Clintons, and one for the rest of the country."
Federal judges received a link to an anti-Semitic blog post. It came from the Justice Department.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Reis Thebault', 'National', 'Breaking News Reporter', 'August At Pm', 'Reis Thebault Is A Reporter Covering National', 'Breaking News. He Has Worked On The Local Desks Of The Boston Globe', 'The Columbus Dispatch. He Joined The Washington Post In June']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2019/08/23/federal-judges-received-link-an-anti-semitic-blog-post-it-came-justice-department/,"The morning briefings come nearly every workday, seemingly chock-full of all the news fit to be seen by employees at the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which handles the country’s immigration cases. Regularly topping two dozen pages, the memos include summaries of articles from outlets national and local, covering topics like “Legal News,” “Enforcement News” and “Police and Legislative News.”

But on Monday, tucked between stories from The Washington Post and a public radio station, the briefing included a summary of and a link to a blog post from what the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a “Hate Group”: Vdare.com, a frequent platform for white nationalists espousing anti-Semitic and anti-immigration rhetoric.

The Vdare post singles out immigration judges by name, uses their photos and refers to them with an anti-Semitic slur. The Justice Department sends the briefings to all EOIR employees, including its 400-some immigration judges, which means the judges named and pictured in the derogatory post also received the link to it this week — from their employer.

The briefing was circulated the same week as President Trump faced accusations of anti-Semitism for asserting that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show “great disloyalty” and for praising Henry Ford, a virulent anti-Semite. It also comes as the Justice Department moves to possibly decertify the union that represents federal immigration judges, which could silence a group critical of some of the administration’s immigration policies.

The union, the National Association of Immigration Judges, lambasted the briefing in a letter to EOIR Director James McHenry. Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the group’s president and one of the judges highlighted in the post, wrote that the union had received numerous complaints from judges across the country.

“The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting Immigration Judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label ‘Kritarch,’ ” Tabaddor said in the letter, which The Post obtained.

When used with a negative tone, the reference to kritarchy, a biblical term for a system of rule by judges in ancient Israel, is “deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,” she wrote. “VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control.”

An EOIR spokeswoman said the blog post, which BuzzFeed News first reported on, “should not have been included.”

“The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,” the office’s assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly told The Post.

She said the briefings are compiled by a contractor, but she did not respond to a question about whether the person responsible would be reprimanded.

Tabaddor asked EOIR to “issue an apology to all EOIR employees, particularly the impacted Immigration Judges.” As of Thursday evening, Tabaddor had not received a formal apology, she told The Post.

The union also called for “immediate steps to ensure that such posts or content is not enshrined as a legitimate news source in future EOIR publications.”

Monday was far from the first time the office’s daily briefing has included questionable content, said immigration attorney Matthew Hoppock, who writes about the EOIR and has researched the office’s morning newsletter.

In April, Hoppock published every EOIR briefing since September 2018, which he received after submitting Freedom of Information Act requests. He said he was appalled at how many stories from right-wing websites the Daily Caller and Breitbart News were included.

“The substance is really gross,” Hoppock said in an interview. “Sometimes they link to The Washington Post or BuzzFeed, but a lot of times it’s just nonsense. It feels like propaganda. It feels like they’re being given an agenda, when they’re supposed to be neutral.”

Another item that stood out to him was a link to a Fox News interview with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who led Trump’s short-lived election integrity commission. The piece was titled, “Migrants have no basis to claim asylum.”

“Why would you send that to immigration judges whose job it is to adjudicate asylum claims?” Hoppock said.

Hoppock criticized the department for spending money on the briefings, which are compiled by the contractor TechMIS. Steven Mains, the firm’s chief executive, said the newsletters are compiled based on a set of government-approved keywords and is then sent to the Justice Department for approval before it’s distributed.

“We make no editorial judgments based on viewpoints, but present the customer with all the news that fits their criteria,” Mains said.

He said the Justice Department has asked the company to omit Vdare content from all future briefings. Hoppock said any claims that the inclusion of far-right material was an innocent mistake are dubious.

“It’s not like they weren’t aware,” Hoppock said, citing a July report, published by the Young Turks, about the office’s distribution of Breitbart articles. “If it is a random Google scrape and they’re picking up white supremacist stuff, they should’ve stopped by now.”

In her letter, Tabaddor said that the union supports the First Amendment and the right to free expression but that “the Department of Justice’s use of its authority to legitimize and provide an imprimatur of respectability to this website under the guise of ‘news’ runs counter to American ideals of equality under the law.”

Barr Seized on Epstein Case as Doubts Mounted About Justice Dept.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Benner'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/william-barr-jeffrey-epstein.html,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr was at home in his study, working on a speech, when the call came from his chief of staff: Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sex trafficking who had connections to an array of political power players, had died in federal prison.

Mr. Barr immediately knew that he would be engulfed in a scandal. The prison had promised to keep Mr. Epstein under constant surveillance until he could be tried on charges of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. With his accusers now robbed of their day in court, the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, looked incompetent at best. And as Mr. Barr scrambled for answers, unfounded conspiracy theories took root, casting an additional pall over the matter and threatening the public’s faith in the department.

Over multiple briefings an hour, Mr. Barr spent that Saturday angrily grilling his deputies. He directed the F.B.I. to investigate Mr. Epstein’s apparent suicide and the department’s inspector general to look for lapses in protocol. After the Bureau of Prisons confirmed the death and the F.B.I. inquiry that morning, Mr. Barr issued a statement, surprising officials who believed the bureau would have the last word. “Mr. Epstein’s death,” he said, “raises serious questions that must be answered.”

Attorneys general rarely follow up on inmate deaths, but Mr. Barr has continued to bird dog the investigation into how one as high-profile as Mr. Epstein could have died in federal care, evidence of how serious the matter is for the Justice Department. This account of his search for answers is based on interviews with six people involved in the investigation into Mr. Epstein’s death, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal department discussions."
$16B veterans' health project hits major snag,https://www.politico.com,['Arthur Allen'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/veterans-health-project-1673379,"The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo health care $16B veterans' health project hits major snag The rollout is likely to be delayed six months, which members of Congress worry could be an early sign of trouble.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie insisted last week that the Trump administration is ""on track"" with a $16 billion project to connect medical records for the military and vets.

But that’s not exactly the case — the project faces significant delays and unanticipated headaches, according to three sources with detailed knowledge of what will be one of the largest technology contracts in federal history.

Story Continued Below

Promoters of the flagship Trump administration project say it will create a model for better-coordinated care for the whole United States, setting up a digitized health care record for millions of current and future veterans from the time they join the military. It’s a massively complex bureaucratic and technical undertaking, however, and a host of glitches have surfaced since the VA contract was signed last year, raising doubts in Congress about whether it can achieve its lofty goals.

Those problems are creating the first major hiccup for the project. Its promised March 2020 rollout at three VA medical centers — one in Spokane, Wash., the others in the Seattle area — is almost certain to be partially or completely delayed until October, the sources said.

In an op-ed published in military newspapers last week, Wilkie said the Trump administration is “working to deliver a win for veterans that prior administrations could not: a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution” that “will give [Pentagon and VA] doctors instant and seamless access to veterans’ full-service health records and history.”

Partly at the urging of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the VA decided in 2017 to sign a no-bid contract with Cerner, which the Defense Department signed up with two years earlier to replace its homegrown records system. Three members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club also have been involved in the effort — at first trying to block the Cerner contract because one of them, physician Bruce Moskowitz, didn't like its software. A cache of 2017 emails released Thursday show that the VA officials in charge of the project humored the Mar-a-Lago group while bristling under their suggestions.

“If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen,"" Rep. Susie Lee said. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo

The Pentagon’s project had gotten off on the wrong foot at four Pacific Northwest bases that year. Initially, the system lost prescriptions and made it difficult for clinicians to log on, leading terrified doctors to fear harm to their patients, as POLITICO reported at the time.

Worried the same might happen to the VA project, its congressional overseers repeatedly have urged the agency to slow the project rather than risk compromising veterans’ health care, so they are not entirely dismayed by news of the likely delay.

“I have said to the VA, time and again, that we’d rather get implementation right than to rush to meet a deadline,” said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), chairwoman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Technology Modernization Subcommittee, in an interview. “If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen.”

The VA recently decided to split the initial implementation into two blocks, one that might go live in March and April, and a second in October, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan. But this would require the VA to offer limited Cerner software to clinicians during the first phase, they said, and it would require the first phase to start at the understaffed and cramped Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center in Spokane. So the agency may hold up the whole project until October.

In a statement to POLITICO, the VA declined to say whether it would push the launch date. The VA ""is continually evaluating its path forward based on lessons learned from the Department of Defense and commercial implementations,"" the agency said. ""We are considering our options.""

A Cerner spokesperson said the VA was ""finalizing their [rollout] strategy"" and ""already ahead of where other clients would typically be at this point in implementation. We are confident we are on the track.”

""It is my understanding that VA is considering delaying the go-live at one or more of the initial Cerner cites,"" said physician and Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), ranking member of the full committee that led oversight of the project for years. ""If delaying the initial go-live date is needed to ensure that implementation is ultimately successful and patient care is enhanced rather than disrupted, then I fully support it.""

The project has been dogged by the inability of the Pentagon and VA to agree to a joint oversight board. The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said.

A new office called the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office was supposed to handle that and other coordination matters, but the office isn’t up and running yet, although the two agencies agreed to set it up last September. They recently notified Congress of the appointment of Neil Evans, a senior VA health care official, as interim leader of the office, with Pentagon health official Holly Joers as his deputy.

The various problems expected in the initial phase of the electronic records project — partial functionality of key clinical software, the need for clinicians to toggle between different software systems, and the enormous task of installing new IT hardware in the first three bases — has some congressional critics worried about the project’s direction.

“Is it going to be something better than what they currently have in VistA?” asked a second congressional source, referring to the VA's current software, which the agency developed in-house over the past 35 years. “That’s our concern.""

At a subcommittee hearing July 25, ranking member Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said the VA team had not provided answers to many questions Congress has asked about how well the system is going to work, including how data will flow between the two systems during the 10 years in which Cerner will replace VistA across the VA.

""I am skeptical that all the technical constraints are known and there aren't more intractable difficulties waiting to be discovered,"" he added.

The VA recently trumpeted the transfer of records from VistA to the Cerner data center as a major first step in the project, but far more complex tasks, such as uploading the records into Cerner’s system and making them usable for VA providers, remain, observers said.

“They have physically deposited the record on the Cerner side of the firewall, but they can’t do anything with the records,” a former VA official said, who compared the situation to having received a large encrypted file in an email.

The VA's statement said it was ""on track"" in transferring the data.

Lee and Banks also had questions about how long the VA planned to have physicians use the Joint Legacy Viewer, a discreet software program that allows a clinician to view older VA and Pentagon patient data.

The cumbersome viewer was one of the reasons the VA cited for moving to a single “seamless” heath record with the Pentagon to begin with, Lee noted. “It’s not clear how it fits into the long-term interoperability strategy, that is, how long it will be needed,” she said.

The VA said that two Cerner platforms — one with software used for patient encounters, the other with historical data and analytical tools — as well as the Joint Legacy Viewer will all be available on different ""tabs"" on the same terminal for clinicians, at least initially.

At the July 25 hearing, senior VA medical adviser Thomas O’Toole acknowledged the “challenge” of “complex clinical scenarios” where veterans are seen in different facilities and clinicians must call up multiple screens to safely review a patient’s data.

“We’re trying to identify those workflow processes in advance so clinicians know what to expect,” he said."
Yield curve inverts again Friday as Trump reignites fears the trade war will lead to a recession,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/us-bonds-treasury-yields-rise-as-investors-await-clues-from-powell-speech.html,"The critical spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year yield inverted Friday after President Donald Trump ordered American companies to steer clear of trade with Beijing.

The president tweeted Friday morning that he was ordering ""our great American companies"" to ""immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was around 1.511%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note was at 1.513%, an inversion of a key segment of the U.S. yield curve. An inversion of the 2-10 yields is viewed by fixed income traders as a recession prognosticator, but trying to forecast exactly when GDP growth contracts is harder to project.

Inversions of that part of the curve have predated every recession over the past 50 years and the last five 2-10 inversions have all led to recessions. Still, even when it does predict a recession, yield curve inversion is, on average, 22 months early, according to Credit Suisse.

The movement in the bond market on Friday was largely pegged to Trump's social media barrage, which sparked fears on Wall Street that the trade war between the U.S. and China isn't close to a resolution and could worsen over the next few months. China announced earlier Friday that it will retaliate against new U.S. tariffs with its own levies on $75 billion more of U.S. goods and resume auto tariffs."
DOJ condemns white nationalist content sent to immigration court employees,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/458527-justice-department-condemns-white-nationalist-content-sent-to,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) has acknowledged it made a mistake by sending a link to a white nationalist blog in an email sent to immigration court employees this week.

A spokesperson for the agency's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) said that the agency had included the link mistakenly. The link, which directed users to the website VDare, contained negative and anti-Semitic comments about sitting immigration judges.

The link came as part of the EOIR's Monday news briefing, which is sent to all employees and contains links to news coverage about the agency, and was first reported by BuzzFeed News.

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"
Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."
Did DOJ Say Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Force Women to Wear Skirts?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/doj-women-skirts-christian/,"On Aug. 19, 2019, the left-leaning website Shareblue Media published an article with the headline “[Department of Justice] Says Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Make Women Wear Skirts,” which reported that:

This term, the Supreme Court will hear a case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to determine whether trans employees can be fired simply for being trans…Currently, the case is before the Supreme Court, to be heard in the 2019-2020 term, and the government has flipped sides. Last week, the Department of Justice wrote a brief arguing the case that the EEOC won in the appellate court should now be reversed, urging the Court to hand a victory to the Christian funeral home owner. The DOJ’s stance is so appalling that the EEOC refused to sign onto the brief. The argument of Solicitor General Noel Francisco, a Trump nominee, is that Title VII is limited only to discrimination based on “biological sex” only and therefore doesn’t cover the firing of Stephens for being transgender. Put another way, the DOJ is arguing that Title VII applies when, say, women are treated worse at a job then men are, but not when transgender workers are treated worse at work than non-transgender workers. It gets worse. The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said “the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man” and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work. You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.

We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Shareblue’s claim that the DOJ had articulated or supported the view that Christian employers should be legally allowed to force female employees to wear a skirt at work.

Background

The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case in question for consideration in July 2018. As of August 2019, it was scheduled for oral arguments in October. Based on accounts filed by the employer Harris Funeral Homes, the employee Aimee Stephens, and the DOJ, as well as an earlier Court of Appeals opinion, the following is the rough sequence of events at the heart of this important but at times complicated case.

Employment and termination

In 2007, Stephens was hired by Harris Homes, which has three funeral-home locations in Michigan. Stephens had been born biologically male and assigned that gender at birth, was given the name William Anthony Beasley Stephens, and went by “Anthony.”

In 2013, she informed her employer that she intended to live as a woman, which she had regarded for a long time as her true gender identity, and that as part of that transition, she intended to have gender-reassignment surgery. That would require living and working as a woman for a year first, and Stephens told Harris Homes she would take a vacation, and would “return to work as [her] true self,” with the intention of presenting herself as a woman and complying with the company’s dress code for women by wearing a skirt and suit jacket at work. Male employees were required to wear a suit and tie.

Before she took that vacation, the owner of the company, Thomas Rost, terminated Stephens’ employment. Stephens filed a sex-discrimination complaint with the federal Equality Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that Rost had fired her “due to her sex and gender identity.” (The EEOC also found the company had discriminated against female employees by providing suits for male workers, free of charge, but not providing an equal allowance to women. Harris Homes changed that particular policy in 2014 and now provides all workers a clothing allowance.)

EEOC and the U.S. District Court

The EEOC investigated Stephens’ complaint and ultimately decided to apply to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 2014, seeking an injunction against Harris Funeral Homes. The agency alleged that — in violation of federal non-discrimination law — the company had “fired Stephens because Stephens is transgender, because of Stephens’s transition from male to female, and/or because Stephens did not conform to [Harris Homes’] sex- or gender-based preferences, expectations or stereotypes.”

The company applied to have the case dismissed, but the District Court denied that motion. However, the court said the EEOC could not claim Title VII discrimination (after Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act) solely on the basis of Stephens’ status as a transgender person, because gender identity was not one of the types of discrimination prohibited by law. (They are: race, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and pregnancy.)

However, the District Court said the EEOC could bring a claim that alleged Harris Homes had engaged in impermissible “sex stereotyping,” based on the fact that Stephens’ firing was related to her stated intention to not wear the clothes prescribed under the company’s male dress code.

(In a precedent-setting 1988 case called “Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said evidence of workplace discrimination based on sex and gender stereotypes could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex-based discrimination. That case revolved around a woman who was denied a partnership at the firm, partly because some decision-makers viewed her behavior and demeanor to be insufficiently “ladylike.” The court found that while the discrimination was not, strictly-speaking, based on the mere fact of her sex, it was inextricably linked to her sex, and could not, by definition, have taken place without reference to her sex. As such, the court concluded, it amounted to legally prohibited sex discrimination.)

In the end, the District Court concluded that Harris Homes had indeed engaged in sex discrimination against Stephens on the basis of the “sex stereotyping” claim, but said the company was exempt from federal non-discrimination law based on the protections provided through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

(In the Stephens case, company owner Rost, a devout Christian, posited a religious objection to continuing to employ a person who would use a dress code different from that of an assigned, biological sex at birth, stating: “… The Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man.”)

The EEOC appealed the District Court’s decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Court of Appeals

In March 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s ruling, finding that Harris Homes did engage in impermissible “sex stereotyping” sex discrimination, and rejecting the company’s claim that sex stereotyping was only impermissible discrimination if it had a disproportionately negative impact on one gender class of employees.

The court also found that Rost had a legitimate right to a religious objection to employing Stephens, but that even the legislation which codified that constitutional right (RFRA) allowed for “greater good” exceptions, where the state has an overriding interest in protecting someone from discrimination, which the court saw as being the case here.

Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, the Court of Appeals also contradicted the District Court’s ruling that the EEOC could not proceed against Harris Homes on the basis of a “pure” discrimination claim. According to the Court of Appeals, gender identity was, in fact, a grounds for a discrimination claim, under federal non-discrimination laws.

In the court’s published opinion, Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote:

“We also hold that discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status violates Title VII … First, it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee’s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee’s sex … We ask whether Stephens would have been fired if Stephens had been a [biological] woman who sought to comply with the women’s dress code. The answer quite obviously is no. This, in and of itself, confirms that Stephens’s sex impermissibly affected Rost’s decision to fire Stephens.

“… Second, discrimination against transgender persons necessarily implicates Title VII’s proscriptions against sex stereotyping … an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of transgender status without imposing its stereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align. There is no way to disaggregate discrimination on the basis of transgender status from discrimination on the basis of gender non-conformity, and we see no reason to try.”

In July 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and was scheduled to hear oral arguments in early October 2019.

DOJ Stance

On Aug. 16, the DOJ filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing on behalf of the federal government that the court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision, thus ruling in favor of Harris Homes and against the EEOC. Despite being the federal respondent to the company’s appeal, the EEOC did not sign on to the government’s (that is, the DOJ’s) Supreme Court brief.

The District Court based its ruling on several grounds, as did the Court of Appeals, so it’s important to understand the reasons put forward by the DOJ for asking the Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision. After all, the DOJ might be calling for the same outcome as the funeral home, but that doesn’t mean they agree on all issues, and they might be advocating the same outcome for differing reasons.

As outlined in the Aug. 16 brief, the following is a rough summary of the DOJ’s arguments:

The meaning of “sex” in the original 1964 Civil Rights act was understood to be biological sex, and Congress has declined to explicitly add transgender status to employment non-discrimination legislation over the years. This means the Court of Appeals was wrong in its claim that federal non-discrimination law does implicitly entail transgender status. Even if discrimination against a transgender person on the basis of being transgender could be regarded as discrimination on the basis of sex, a claimant must prove that he or she was negatively impacted by that discrimination by comparison with a counterpart of the opposite sex. Since discrimination against transgender persons would negatively impact trans men as much as trans women, this would not be the case. If the Supreme Court accepts that merely considering sex amounts to impermissible sex discrimination, without this element of disproportionate harm, then the court would have to invalidate any and all sex-specific policies, including dress codes and sex-specific bathrooms. The argument that discrimination based on transgender status inherently requires impermissible sex stereotyping fails because the basis of that precedent, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, did not involve a declaration that any and all sex stereotyping was impermissible, only that evidence of sex stereotyping could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex discrimination. Furthermore, Stephens hasn’t been able to prove that she was disproportionately negatively impacted by comparison with a member of the opposite sex — that is, that (in the DOJ’s language) a biological woman would have been allowed to dress under the male dress code.

Did the DOJ say what Shareblue claimed it said?

As of Aug. 23, oral arguments had not taken place, but so far at least, the DOJ hasn’t argued that “Christian employers should be allowed to make women wear skirts,” as Shareblue’s headline claimed. In fact, the “religious objection” exemption that the District Court afforded Harris Homes and its owner Rost has not formed part of the DOJ’s arguments.

Shareblue claimed that:

“The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said ‘the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man’ and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work.”

That is not accurate. The DOJ brief mentions the fact that Rost said this, but does not endorse that view. The actual point the DOJ makes about this, which Shareblue omitted, is that the fact Rost would be equally willing to fire both a biological man and biological woman who both refused to dress under the dress code of their assigned gender shows (in the DOJ’s opinion) that the policy does not favor one sex over the other, meaning it is permissible under federal non-discrimination law.

The DOJ has not endorsed or supported Rost’s biblically founded viewpoint on gender or attire, nor his company’s specific dress code policy. Rather, the DOJ has quite narrowly and specifically argued that the policy does not unfairly favor or burden workers of one sex over the other, and so does not violate non-discrimination law.

Shareblue went on to claim:

“You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.”

This is very misleading. Again, the DOJ did not make a religious exemption argument in its Supreme Court brief, and its argument that Harris Homes’ dress code does not unfairly burden one sex over the other is not contingent upon the particular religious faith of the employer. So the conditional statement “as long as a Christian business owner demands it,” is a highly misleading representation of what the DOJ has actually argued.

Is the DOJ arguing that any business owner, regardless of religious faith (or absence thereof) “should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work”? Not exactly, but the DOJ is arguing that this is what the law already allows, under certain conditions.

The DOJ is not making an argument from a moral viewpoint, saying what “should” be allowed and what should not be allowed. As is the norm for briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, the DOJ is arguing what it perceives existing law to require — taking into account the text of legislation, the precedents set in past federal court decisions, as well as the intentions and understandings of lawmakers when they wrote the legislation in question. These are legal arguments, not moral ones, and they are arguments based on what the DOJ understands is the case, not what the DOJ thinks should be the case.

In this particular instance, the DOJ is arguing that the existing body of non-discrimination law does not recognize transgender status as one of the grounds for a “pure” discrimination claim (like race, sex, religion, and so on); and that existing law does not regard a workplace policy as impermissible if it merely takes into account sex, rather than unfairly favoring or burdening one sex over the other.

Therefore, the DOJ is in effect arguing that existing law already allows an employer to impose different dress codes for male and female workers, provided those dress codes don’t unfairly burden or favor one sex over the other. In this narrow sense, Shareblue’s headline has an element of truth — having different dress codes for men and women could involve obliging female employees to wear skirts (or pantsuits, or scarves, or dresses, and so on.)

But that headline is woefully incomplete and therefore misleads readers about the DOJ’s actual argument, because having different dress codes for men and women would equally involve obliging male employees to wear trousers, suits, ties, and so on.

So for Shareblue to cherry-pick only one side of the implications of the DOJ’s argument, by focusing, in its headline, on “women” and “skirts,” misleads readers while also missing the very point the DOJ made in that argument: that once the burden from sex-specific policies like dress codes is equally shared by men and women, the law allows that policy."

The National Association of Immigration Judges said the DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) sent court employees a link to an article from VDare, a white nationalist website, in its morning news briefing Monday that included anti-Semitic references to judges.

The emails are sent to court employees on weekdays, and they include links to news articles about immigration. The blog post in question includes reporting about the DOJ taking steps to decertify the immigration judges' union, and it allegedly includes pictures of some judges with the label “Kritarch” before their names, an anti-Semitic slur.

“The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting immigration judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label ‘Kritarch.’ The reference to Kritarch in a negative tone is deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,” union chief Ashley Tabaddor wrote in a Thursday letter to James McHenry, the director of the EOIR.

“VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,” she continued.

A former senior Department of Justice official, who was not named, explained to BuzzFeed News that the email was ""generated by a third-party vendor that utilizes keyword searches to produce news clippings for staff.""

""It is not reviewed or approved by staff before it is transmitted,"" the official added.

Tabaddor demanded that McHenry take immediate action for the shared post, withdrawing the email and issuing an apology, BuzzFeed News reported. She also called on the EOIR to take “all appropriate safety and security measures.”

“Publication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice,” Tabbaddor wrote.

EOIR assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly said in a statement to The Hill that the news briefings ""are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included.""

""The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Mattingly said.

"New VA drug aims to 'make a dent' in vet suicide crisis, Secretary Wilkie says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Melissa Leon'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/va-drug-veteran-suicide-robert-wilkie,"Twenty-two American veterans are said to die by suicide every day, and the Department of Veterans Affairs is taking a step to fight that sobering statistic at the request of President Trump.

The president on Wednesday said he instructed the VA to place a substantial order of Spravato, which is used to help treat depression in patients who might not have seen results from other treatments or drugs, although some medical experts have said the drug's effectiveness is not entirely clear.

Spravato would be part of a new combination of drugs administered in spray form, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday morning, noting that the VA has prescribed Spravato for years “but in intravenous form and under the supervision of anesthesiologists.”

“What we’re doing now is transitioning to the nasal spray,” Wilkie said on “America’s Newsroom.” “It’s still under the supervision of anesthesiologists at [the] VA, but FDA has approved the combination of several drugs and Spravato [as] a means to combat depression.”

VETERAN WALKS FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO DISNEY WORLD TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE AMONG SERVICE MEMBERS

“We are doing everything we can to address the issues involving depression and mental health. I’ve said many times that we’ve not even had that national conversation about mental health that we desperately need,” Wilkie stressed, pointing also to addiction and homelessness.

“It’s in its opening stages when it comes to that combination of drugs the FDA has approved for us, to see if we can make a dent in depression,” Wilkie told Fox News’ Jon Scott and Sandra Smith.

On Wednesday, before departing for the American Veterans (AMVETS) national convention in Kentucky, President Trump told reporters he had instructed the VA to buy “a lot” of Spravato.

“There’s a product that’s made right now that just came out by Johnson & Johnson which has a tremendously positive, pretty short-term, but nevertheless a positive effect,” Trump said, McClatchy reported. “I’ve instructed the head of the VA to go out and buy a lot of it, and we are buying a lot of it.”

At the AMVETS convention, Trump said there’s been no issue more urgent than the veteran suicide crisis.

“My administration is determined to do everything in our power to save the lives of our heroes,” Trump said.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CANCELLING STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR DISABLED VETERANS

The president said earlier at the White House that he hopes the VA is “getting [the medication] at a very good cost” from Johnson & Johnson.

One dose of Spravato is $295, according to McClatchy; a patient’s total daily cost could be more than $700 if they need two and a half sprays, which is common. Since the Food and Drug Administration has approved the treatment for the VA, Medicare and Medicaid would cover 65 percent of each dose, McClatchy noted.

Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday that a veteran can be given the Spravato nasal spray if his or her doctor and team approve its use.

(Jim Bourg/REUTERS)

The Justice Department on Thursday said it made a mistake by including a white-nationalist blog post in an email to immigration-court employees earlier this week.

The link to VDare, a white-nationalist website, was included in the agency’s Monday news briefing, a list of links to news stories about the agency and immigration sent to all federal immigration-court employees.

“The daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,” an Executive Office of Immigration Review spokesperson said.

A former Justice Department official added that the email is “generated by a third-party vendor that utilizes keyword searches to produce news clippings for staff. It is not reviewed or approved by staff before it is transmitted.”

“The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,” EOIR assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly said.

“Publication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-Semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice,” the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ) said in a statement, adding that the post “directly attacks sitting immigration judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs.”

The Trump administration has recently begun efforts to decertify the NAIJ, the union representing immigration judges, which the union is contesting.

“VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,” union chief Ashley Tabaddor wrote.

The union also called on the DOJ to provide “security measures for all judges,” given the sentiments expressed in the blog post"

Trump Administration Drops Proposal to Cut Foreign Aid After Intense Debate,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Annie Karni', 'Emily Cochrane']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/politics/trump-foreign-aid.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday rejected a proposal from budget hawks in the administration to curb foreign aid spending after objections from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and lawmakers from both parties, officials briefed on the decision said.

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget, which since 2017 has been led by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, had spent much of August working on the proposal. It would have imposed an estimated $4 billion of cuts to foreign aid funding this year from money that Congress had approved but that the State Department and the United States Agency for International Department had not designated yet for specific programs.

In recent days, members of Congress, Mr. Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin lobbied against the package, questioning the legality and effect of the move less than two months before the end of the fiscal year. Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Trump’s most trusted cabinet official, won a similar argument against the budget office last August.

The latest retreat is another instance in which the administration and Capitol Hill, confronted with a ballooning deficit and national debt after the most recent round of tax cuts, have struggled to reach agreement over how to rein in government spending. A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the proposal was motivated by the president’s desire to trim the amount of money dedicated to foreign assistance, a tiny slice of the federal budget but one that conservatives have long targeted as unnecessary."

Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Clean water or mining pollution for the nation's favorite wilderness? MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

The article was posted on the white nationalist website VDare, which routinely traffics in racist and anti-immigration rhetoric and has explicitly targeted immigration judges in the past.

Ashley Tabbador, the head of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a letter to the Justice Department that the email came from the department's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).

Tabbador wrote that the article ""directly attacks"" immigration judges ""with racial and ethnically tinged slurs,"" and the label 'Kritarch,'"" according to BuzzFeed. ""The reference to Kritarch in a negative tone is deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,"" Tabbador added.

Kritarch is a term derived from the concept of a ""kritarchy,"" or a society run by judges. It's referenced in the Old Testament's Book of Judges as a type of rule in ancient Israel. VDare has repeatedly used the term to pejoratively refer to immigration judges.

Tabbador called on James McHenry, the head of EOIR, to take action following the dissemination of the article.

""Publication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice,"" she wrote. She added that the court should withdraw the email and issue an apology to immigration judges."
"Results: Iowa Corn Dominates Estimates, Minnesota is Just Below 2018",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/results-iowa-corn-dominates-estimates-minnesota-just-below-2018,"Iowa again reigns “King Corn.” After falling behind Illinois in 2018, the Hawkeye State’s corn yields prove dominant over all previous 2019 Pro Farmer Crop Tour state estimates. Iowa soybean pod counts take second, just below Nebraska’s, but still prove to be impressive.

Minnesota, while not the winning awards for biggest crops this year, is showing respectable yield and pod count estimates—despite challenges last fall and this spring.

Iowa corn yields came in strong at 182.83 bu. per acre and soybeans reached 1,106.91 pods per 3x3 square. When compared with 2018 Pro Farmer estimates, corn is just 2.9% short and soybeans are 8.4% less.

“You know, it wasn’t the best crop by any means we’ve seen in Iowa,” says Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor and leader of the east leg of the Crop Tour. “I think variability and things like that are what’s going to hold it down from being really good.”

It’s a decent crop, not necessarily a great crop when you compare it to record-breaking recent years. However, in corn at least, it’s still the strongest state in the tour. Soybeans, however, seemed to struggle a little more.

“They look like double crop soybeans in some cases,” says Jeff Wilson, leader of the western leg of the Pro Farmer Crop Tour. “And they may perform that way when it’s all said and done.”

While Iowa has the potential to be one of the more impressive U.S. cropping states, it hasn’t been without challenges. Struggles from a wet spring are showing up in August.

“It’s not the sins of the spring this year,” says Chip Flory, AgriTalk host and Pro Farmer editorial director. “It was a forced error.”

After fighting tooth and nail just to get the crop in, farmers are now looking at more immature crops than normal in August—but not dangerously immature. There could be additional quality issues coming down the road, too.

Here’s how each district shaped up after more than 800 total samples:

Corn District 1: 66 samples Yield 184.88 District 2: 40 samples Yield 178.06 District 3: 55 samples Yield 184.66 District 4: 63 samples Yield 192.71 District 5: 33 samples Yield 178.61 District 6: 72 samples Yield 172.42 District 7: 35 samples Yield 186.28 District 8: 10 samples Yield 188.94 District 9: 34 samples Yield 183.91

Soybeans District 1: 65 samples Pods 1095.93 District 2: 39 samples Pods 1159.57 District 3: 57 samples Pods 1106.25 District 4: 62 samples Pods 1196.06 District 5: 33 samples Pods 1026.07 District 6: 73 samples Pods 1091.25 District 7: 35 samples Pods 1221.13 District 8: 9 samples Pods 1018.11 District 9: samples Pods 924.03



Minnesota corn yields hit 170.37 bu. per acre and 965.31 pods per 3x3 square—both just slightly lower than 2018 Pro Farmer estimates. Year over year, soybeans are down 11.4% and corn yield is down 4.6%.

One of the biggest challenges holding Minnesota’s corn crop back is green snap and prevent plant. However, prevent plant isn’t included in yield estimates. Still, tour scouts took note of holes in fields, which will impact final yield numbers because those acres are considered “harvested acres” by USDA.

Overall, Minnesota is a young crop with some catching up to do.

“It needs daylight, sunlight,” Wilson says. “It needs low humidity and warmer temperatures and dry weather. It’s going to take five weeks for some of that crop.”

Minnesota districts showed some variability in their more-than 200 total samples:

Corn District 5: 6 samples Yield 181.39 District 7: 46 samples Yield 157.03 District 8: 94 samples Yield 174.15 District 9: 40 samples Yield 175.20

Soybeans District 5: 5 samples Yield 928.80 District 7: 44 samples Yield 975.98 District 8: 91 samples Yield 933.31 District 9: 36 samples Yield 886.59

(Lynne Sladky/AP)

THE PROGNOSIS

The health and well-being of migrant children is again front and center in the immigration wars as the Trump administration rejiggers rules around keeping them — along with their families — in jail-like settings for longer periods of time.

Two federal agencies that handle immigrants — the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security — say they’ll issue a rule tomorrow allowing children to stay with their parents in United States detention centers for longer than the current 20-day maximum, as they await hearings on their cases.

The change lets the Trump administration keep entire families in custody as long as needed. The other options are to release migrant kids before their cases are resolved or separate children from parents, as DHS did last year before ending the practice after a massive outcry from the public. President Trump has claimed that holding families in custody will discourage more people from seeking U.S. asylum at the Mexico border.

“One of the things that is happening, when they see you can’t get into the United States — or when they see if they do get into the United States they will be brought back to their country — they won’t come,” the president said yesterday. “And many people will be saved.”

But to Democrats and immigrant advocates, it’s yet another protectionist advance by an administration intent on spurning immigrants wherever possible — and could allow virtually unlimited incarceration of children, a condition which experts say carries risks for their mental and physical health.

“This proposed rule breaks every international treaty governing humane detention of prisoners — and make no mistake, that’s what these children would be,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. “There is simply no justification for detaining children — or any humans — indefinitely.”

Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.):

The government AGREED to protect kids under the Flores Agreement. It wasn’t doing enough then and isn’t doing nearly enough now. And now Pres. Trump wants to make indefinite detention and these terrible conditions legal. It’s a shameless abdication of our basic responsibilities. — Sen. Patrick Leahy (@SenatorLeahy) August 21, 2019

Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.):

Knowing that detention is always harmful to children, it is infuriating that the Administration has decided to gut the Flores settlement. #SaveFlores — Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (@RepRoybalAllard) August 21, 2019

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus:

Flores protects migrant children from indefinite detention & inhumane conditions.



Now, the Trump Admin is trying to tear it up & indefinitely imprison families.



This will cause irreparable harm to children & deeply contradicts our American values. #JusticeForOurChildren https://t.co/za1Q7y5xcT — Hispanic Caucus (@HispanicCaucus) August 21, 2019

This all revolves around a 1997 court settlement known as known as the Flores Settlement Agreement governing how migrant kids and teens should be treated while in U.S. custody. The federal government was accused in the 1980s of mistreating immigrant children, which led to a series of lawsuits that were settled under Flores, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

Generally speaking, the Flores Settlement says the government must move kids from austere border jails into licensed, child-appropriate facilities as quickly as possible. While the agreement doesn’t specify a time period, a federal judge set out the 20-day standard in a 2015 ruling.

Tomorrow’s final rule will replace the provisions of Flores — and will face a tsunami of legal challenges saying it falls far short of upholding the Flores protections. The rule’s impact will be most immediately felt by migrant families currently in U.S. custody, who could find themselves held within border detention facilities for months.

But there could also be ripple effects for children who have arrived at the border without their parents, many of them fleeing violence and poverty in Central American countries. These unaccompanied children, who are the responsibility of HHS, are also covered by the Flores Settlement. The new rule could significantly weaken protections around them.

“It will allow HHS, in more circumstances, to hold children in more secure facilities,” Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, told me. “It would diminish the requirement they have to continuously look for release alternatives for unaccompanied children.”

Julia Preston, former immigration correspondent for the New York Times:

Somehow @DHSMcAleenan got through the press conference this a.m. without mentioning the core change: detaining children. The new rule eliminates Flores constraints on time @DHSgov can hold children of any age, if part of a family. #bordercrisis — Julia Preston (@JuliaPrestonNow) August 21, 2019

NBC News's Andrea Mitchell, quoting an American Civil Liberties Union attorney:

On Trump vs. Flores ruling, @leegelernt says, ""Medical community has been so clear that not only separating families causes severe trauma, but holding children in these jail type settings for months will cause serious harm. We're hopeful the courts strike this down."" #AMRstaff — Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) August 21, 2019

Border Patrol facilities have been criticized for overcrowded and less-than-humane conditions. HHS has come under some similar criticisms for temporary shelters it says it was forced to set up as the number of unaccompanied children surged. But HHS Secretary Alex Azar has consistently defended his agency’s handling of the situation and said in a statement yesterday that it will continue providing migrant children with compassionate care.

“As before, HHS will continue to protect the safety and dignity of unaccompanied alien children in our custody as we seek to place the with a parent, relative or other suitable sponsor,” Azar said in a statement.

As for families who are still together — keeping them in detention longer would mark a major coup for the White House, which has said it’s a way to deter mass migration at the border, my colleague Maria Sacchetti reports.

“Officials said they hoped the threat of longer detention would deter the crush of Central American migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and complement existing enforcement measures,” Maria writes. “Border apprehensions have slumped more than 40 percent since May, a major drop officials have attributed to increased enforcement in Mexico, but officials worry about a resurgence in the fall.

“Smugglers have sold families discounted trips to the border and instructed them to seek asylum because the Flores agreement meant they were likely to be released,” she continues. “Such families are rarely deported, officials said.”

AHH: The Trump administration is appealing a federal court ruling earlier this summer striking down its new requirement that drug companies disclose wholesale prices in TV ads. Yesterday HHS filed a notice of appeal to the ruling, in which U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the agency would need authority from Congress to require the disclosure of list prices. The HHS rule is part of a larger push by the administration to put downward pressure on drug prices.

""If the drug companies are embarrassed by their prices or afraid that the prices will scare patients away, they should lower them,"" HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley told Reuters.

OOF: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is responding to fears among organized labor that his Medicare-for-all plan would negatively affect their benefits. His campaign announced a change yesterday that would effectively give organized labor more negotiating power than other consumers would have under his plan by forcing employers to pay out any money they save to union members in other benefits, The Post's Chelsea Janes, Dave Weigel and Holly Bailey report.

""Labor representatives have expressed concerns to candidates publicly and to campaign staffs privately that a single-payer system could negatively affect their benefits, which in many cases offer better coverage than private plans,"" my colleagues report. ""One of the primary concerns union members and leaders have raised about Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan is that they negotiated health-care coverage under the current system, in some cases ceding salary in exchange for those benefits.""

A Sanders aide said the provision “does not open a door for private insurance,” which would be mostly eliminated under Medicare-for-all. Campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said the change is meant to guarantee that any savings to employers under the Medicare-for-all plan “must be passed on to their organized workers in the form of additional wages or benefits.” Here's our recent Health 202 on how organized labor feels about Medicare-for-all.

OUCH: In the wake of Planned Parenthood's decision to reject $60 million in federal family planning funds, its clinics in several states are charging new fees, tapping into financial reserves, intensifying fundraising and warning of more unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, the Associated Press reports.The group announced Monday it will refuse about $60 million in federal grants to provide low-income women with birth control and screenings. The new Title X rules, which we explained in this Health 202, say clinics can't use the funds to refer for abortions and must have financial separation from any abortion services.

""The fallout is especially intense in Utah, where Planned Parenthood has been the only provider participating in the nearly 50-year-old Title X program, and will now lose about $2 million yearly in federal funds that helped serve 39,000 mostly low-income, uninsured people,"" AP's Lindsay Whitehurst and David Crary write.

""It intends to maintain its services — which include contraception, STD testing and cancer screening — but is considering charging a small copay for patients who used to get care for free...Planned Parenthood in Minnesota is in a similar situation, serving about 90% of the state’s Title X patients, and plans to start charging fees due to the loss of $2.6 million in annual funding,"" they write.

— Nationally, Planned Parenthood is trying to fundraise off its decision to withdraw from Title X, sending at least two email blasts earlier this week asking supporters for donations to help it fight back against the Trump administration's changes to the program rules.

“Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide are being forced out of the Title X program,” one of the emails says. “Right now we're doing everything we can do keep health center doors open. Say you're ready to fight back by rushing an emergency gift now.”

Trump Finds Unlikely Ally in Greenland Aspirations: Iran,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-08-22/trump-finds-unlikely-ally-in-greenland-aspirations-iran,"President Donald Trump faced almost universal opposition this week to his idea of purchasing Greenland from Denmark, though an unlikely ally emerged Thursday acknowledging the move would align with the commander in chief's perceived doctrine.

Iranian state news service Fars published an analysis Thursday afternoon detailing news this week that the president wishes to purchase the island governed by Denmark that straddles the Arctic Circle and where the U.S. maintains a key military base. It described Trump as ""unconventional and seemingly obsessed with reasserting U.S. hegemony"" but acknowledged the Arctic as a geopolitically critical region, currently contested by other powers like Russia and China.

""This scenario makes the island of Greenland, freezing and home to only 50,000 inhabitants, an extremely strategic location,"" Fars noted. ""Thus the idea that Trump aspires to acquire the island for the United States and militarize it accordingly is by no means unreasonable in his strategic calculus, even if the idea is a non-starter.""

Trump announced by Twitter earlier this week he was canceling a planned trip to Denmark in early September, later explaining he took issue with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's dismissal of his apparent bid. Trump on Wednesday called Fredericksen "" nasty "" for her comments. He also lamented via Twitter that Denmark does not spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense – a goal NATO countries in 2014 agreed they would each achieve by 2024.

In its analysis, Fars noted of Greenland, ""Denmark on its own does not have the resources or capabilities to make it useful on behalf of NATO, which is why Trump likely hit out at them over military spending.""

Remaining on message with the regime's central talking points, it concluded that Iran should take seriously the White House's pursuit of Greenland as a part of what it considers U.S. efforts to ""to maintain worldwide military supremacy.""

""American history is defined almost solely by territorial expansion for strategic ends. It may have fallen dormant, but Trump has very much rekindled an old flame for strategic ends. This illustrates as a whole just how far this administration is willing to go to reassert unilateral hegemony over the world – even if that means disappointing old allies.""

Many have expressed grave concern in recent days about Trump's intentions regarding a potential sale. Reactions from senior officials and lawmakers in Copenhagen have varied from calling the situation a "" laughing stock "" to a "" diplomatic crisis ."" Multiple officials from the Obama administration have spoken out about the importance of U.S. relations with Denmark – a founding member of NATO – calling it one of America's most important allies ."
Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people.,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/2019/8/21/20826601/trump-auto-company-fuel-economy-california,"President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities.

In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed.

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy.

But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.

The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal.

The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025.

Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon.

The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama benchmark. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.

That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 13 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.

So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight.

To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis.

The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale.

Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions.

So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves.

Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the scope of California’s waiver from federal air quality rules."
Justice charges 80 in massive online fraud case linked to Nigerian defendants,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458446-justice-charges-80-in-massive-online-fraud-case-linked-to-nigerian,"The Department of Justice on Thursday unsealed a 252-count federal indictment charging 80 defendants, many of whom are Nigerian nationals, with conspiring to steal millions of dollars through online scams.

The indictment was unsealed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and was made public shortly after authorities arrested 14 of the defendants across the United States, with 11 of these defendants apprehended in the Los Angeles region. The majority of the defendants are outside the country, with many likely in Nigeria.

The defendants involved in the case were charged with attempting to defraud individuals of millions of dollars through the use of business email compromise (BEC) and online romance scams, in addition to other schemes meant to target the elderly.

The investigation is being led by the FBI, with each of the defendants charged with “conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft,” according to Justice Department. Some defendants also face fraud and money laundering charges.

U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna described the scams used by the defendants during a press conference on Thursday, saying that “fraud networks now target individuals and businesses alike.”

“In the BEC scams, the fraudsters will often hack a company’s email system, impersonate company personnel, and direct payments to bank accounts that funnel money back to the fraudsters in Nigeria,” Hanna said. “In the romance scams, victims think they are developing a dating relationship, when in fact they are just being tricked into sending money to the fraudsters.”

Hanna added that “we believe this is one of the largest cases of its kind in U.S. history.”

Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said during the same press conference that losses involved in this case for victims total around $10 million. He said defendants attempted to obtain $40 million from victims.

There were at least 32 victims in the case, from the United States and other countries including Japan, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Ukraine, China, Mexico, Germany, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Delacourt said the case began in 2016 after one individual was victimized by the defendants. The two main defendants in the case are Nigerian citizens Valentine Iro and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe.

“In the days ahead, we will be working with our foreign counterparts in nine countries to apprehend 57 additional defendants,” Delacourt said, noting that six defendants are still at large in the United States.

Delacourt emphasized the seriousness of these types of fraud, noting that in the first seven months of 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 14,000 complaints related to BEC scams, with a total loss of nearly $1.1 billion for victims.

“This crime is growing exponentially in terms of losses and victims,” Delacourt said. “While we are happy to announce these charges today, we are not going to arrest our way out of this problem, and we so we continue to educate potential victims.”"
Overstock CEO gave info to DOJ for John Durham's review of Russia investigation origins,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/overstock-ceo-gave-info-to-doj-for-john-durhams-review-of-russia-investigation-origins,"Former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said he has provided information to the Justice Department for its investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.

In multiple interviews Thursday, following his exit from the e-commerce retailer he led for two decades, Byrne described how he was an informant for the FBI and later turned to Attorney General William Barr when he felt that he had become part of a ""deep state"" plot.

Byrne told Fox News that he has provided documents that made their way to U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with leading the review of the DOJ's and FBI's conduct in the early stages of the inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

In an interview with CNN, Byrne said he fed his information to the DOJ on Apr. 5 and Apr. 30, after which it was revealed that Durham had been asked to determine if there was any wrongdoing at the genesis of the Trump-Russia probe.

The 57-year-old multimillionaire resigned as CEO on Thursday, saying it was best for Overstock. The company saw its shares plummet more than 30% after he publicly detailed his involvement in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Byrne claimed that beginning in 2015, the FBI reached out to him for help in conducting law enforcement activities. He said he later discovered that he was being used in a ""political espionage"" effort targeting Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Ted Cruz. Byrne also said he liked former President Barack Obama and did not vote for Trump.

Byrne said he received orders down the pipeline from former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who played key roles in the Clinton emails and Russia investigations. Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after it was discovered he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair, and was fired last year. Byrne said federal officials confirmed with him that it was Strzok who gave him orders.

Claiming the bureau was ""hijacked from the top,"" Byrne also named former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as being aware of his role. He told CNN host Chris Cuomo, who asked about proof, that he is ""highly confident"" Barr will be naming the three former FBI officials in an indictment in the near future.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the FBI, DOJ, and Strzok's lawyer. The FBI and Strzok's lawyer declined to comment, while the DOJ did not immediately return the request for comment

Byrne said he is not the only ""whistleblower"" coming forward, and asserted that Clinton's supporters in Hollywood were targets of spying.

As Byrne faced questions from skeptical interviewers on Thursday, CNN reported that a U.S. official confirmed that Byrne shared information about the early stages of the Russia investigation during a meeting earlier this year. This source said Justice officials found part of Byrne's story to be credible because what he was saying was not widely known.

Byrne is the latest person to emerge as a possible FBI informant used over the course of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign. Another one of these individuals is Stefan Halper, a 75-year-old Cambridge professor who reportedly had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: foreign policy aides George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The New York Times reported in April that the Justice Department inspector general was looking into his actions to see if he exceeded the scope of his assignment.

Byrne first revealed a couple weeks ago to the Washington Examiner his claim that he engaged in a sexual relationship with Russian spy Maria Butina at the encouragement of the FBI, but did not rekindle the romantic aspect of their relationship when asked to do so as the Russia investigation progressed. Byrne said he had been swept up in “political espionage"" and a ""deep state"" plot. Butina was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison for conspiring with a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative American political circles and influence U.S. relations with Russia.

Byrne, who claimed he was offered a $1 billion ""bribe"" to keep quiet, said he received advice from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whom he called his ""rabbi,"" and chose to come forward because he felt guilty, tying the decision to the recent wave of deadly mass shootings.

“The issue is, I realized that these orders I got came from Peter Strzok, and as I put together things, I know much more than I should know and tried to keep silent,” he told Fox Business. “This country has gone nuts, and especially for the last year when I realized what I know, every time I see one of these things, somebody drives 600 miles to gun down 20 strangers in the mall, I guess I feel a bit responsible.”"
Pompeo praises US 'ally' Denmark after Trump cancels state visit,https://www.cnbc.com,['Chloe Taylor'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/pompeo-praises-denmark-after-trump-cancels-state-visit-over-greenland.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a media briefing at the State Department June 10, 2019 in Washington, DC.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Denmark as a cooperative ally following a phone call with his Danish counterpart.

Pompeo held the call with Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod Wednesday to discuss President Donald Trump's canceled state visit to the country, which had been scheduled to take place in early September.

""The Secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's cooperation as one of the United States' allies and Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""The Secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — in the Arctic.""

Denmark's Kofod said Wednesday that the conversation had been ""frank, friendly and constructive"" and affirmed the two nations' strong bond.

""(The) U.S. and Denmark are close friends and allies with a long history of active engagement across (the) globe,"" he said on Twitter. ""(We) agreed to stay in touch on full range of issues of mutual interest.""

Trump surprised Danish officials on Tuesday when he took to Twitter to announce he would no longer go to Denmark next month, with the president later dubbing Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ""nasty"" for her response to his idea that the U.S. could purchase Greenland. On Sunday, Frederiksen said Trump's suggestion of purchasing the territory was ""absurd,"" telling Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Greenland is a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The land mass is considered to be rich with coal, zinc, copper and iron ore.

Trump said Tuesday that he would reschedule his visit to Denmark ""for another time."""
Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

Kathy McCoy CBS News

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

Robert Levy Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a comprehensive plan on Friday that calls for “decriminalizing all drug possession” in his first presidential term as a means to combat the opioid epidemic and treat addiction as a public health, rather than criminal justice, issue.

Decriminalization is just one action the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said he’d pursue in order to reform the country’s mental health care system and bolster substance abuse treatment. His plan also includes proposals to reduce sentences for drug offenses other than possession, increase access to the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone and make it easier to implement syringe exchange programs.

America’s addiction and mental health care crisis has been building for decades—due to decades of neglect by political leaders in Washington. Today, I’m proposing a new approach that tackles this crisis with the urgency and care it deserves. pic.twitter.com/U8F9DXJPC2 — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 23, 2019

Buttigieg’s “Healing and Belonging in America” plan emphasizes the need to divert people suffering from addiction away from prisons and into treatment. He said he’d accomplish that by expanding diversionary programs and evidence-based training “for drug courts, mental health courts, and other alternatives to incarceration for justice-involved persons.”

The goal of decriminalization and diversion is to reduce “the number of people incarcerated due to mental illness or substance use by 75 percent in the first term.”

Our country is in the midst of a mental health and addiction crisis, worsened by decades of stigma and political neglect. I’ll bring a new approach, rooted in commitment and community, to tackle this crisis with the urgency it deserves. https://t.co/spBoh5KH4X — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 23, 2019

Under his plan, sentencing reform for drug offenses other than possession would be applied retroactively and coupled with expungements for past convictions. Buttigieg pointed to research demonstrating that “incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths” and instead “actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

“We cannot incarcerate ourselves out of this public health problem.”

“To ensure that people with a mental illness or substance use disorder can heal, we will decriminalize these conditions,” the proposal states. “When someone is undergoing a crisis or is caught using a drug, they should be treated by a health professional rather than punished in a jail cell.”

The mayor also made harm reduction policies a key component of his strategy. He said take-home naloxone programs would be expanded to all 50 states by 2024 and that harm reduction services would be expanded “to reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases related to needle sharing.”

The plan would make naloxone “broadly available in order to reverse overdoses” and remove “legislative and regulatory restrictions on the use of federal funds for syringe service programs.”

Buttigieg said the federal government should provide funding for state and local health departments to purchase the medication, make sure that it’s “available in public spaces and workplaces” similar to first aid kids and encourage “co-prescribing of naloxone with opioids, either by individual physicians or direct dispensing by pharmacists.”

Existing federal law makes it difficult to establish syringe exchange programs, in part because federal funds can’t be used to buy needles. The restrictions “hamper state and local responses, both because they limit resources and because they convey a negative message about the value of these programs, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that they can prevent transmission of HIV and hepatitis.”

In addition to lifting those barriers, the candidate said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “would also work with states to remove any criminal liability for those participating in” syringe exchange programs.

“Harm reduction programs are a critical part of any effective response to the opioid and injection drug use crisis. They minimize the negative impact of drug use without encouraging it, while reducing other side effects of drug use. In particular, this means access to syringe service programs for people who inject drugs, that link them to treatment, and provides access to sterile syringes. These programs help prevent transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis, and other infectious diseases associated with needle sharing, and reduce overdoses by deploying medication such as naloxone that help reverse the effects of opioids.”

One harm reduction policy that didn’t make the cut in Buttigieg’s plan is safe injection sites, where people could use illicit drugs under the supervision of medical professionals who could reverse overdoses and recommend treatment options. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who are also running for the Democratic nomination, both proposed legalizing such facilities as part of criminal justice reform plans they released this month.

“Decades of failed mental health and addiction policy, coupled with mass incarceration that criminalized mental illness and drug use, have left us with a mental health and addiction care system so broken that today there are more people with serious mental illness in prisons than in treatment facilities,” Buttigieg said.

The candidate also made ending incarceration for drug possession—as well as legalizing marijuana—central principles of his previously released criminal justice reform plan, which he released last month.

But while the prior plan did not explicitly describe the move as “decriminalizing” drugs, even though advocates commonly use that word to refer to policies that remove the threat of being imprisoned for possession, the new document does use that terminology—signaling a shift in clarity as Buttigieg continues to develop his campaign messaging.

In other instances, he borrowed language from his criminal justice reform plan, specifically as it concerns how criminalizing drug use can increase rates of overdose, for his mental health proposal.

“Despite equal rates of use, Black Americans are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for using marijuana,” the criminal justice plan states. “Research shows that incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths. In fact, some studies show that incarceration actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

Buttigieg mentioned that, as with drug offenses, black people are also more likely to die from overdoses. And that’s due to “the current broken system that criminalizes mental illness and addiction” that was “built during the crack epidemic of the 1980s.”

USDA Begs Americans to Finally Stop Washing Their Chicken,https://www.inverse.com,[],,,,https://www.inverse.com/article/58691-do-not-wash-chicken-poultry,"Raw chicken, with its slightly slimy sheen, doesn’t look clean enough to eat. That doesn’t mean that you should wash it with water, though. While it’s common practice for some — and even the legendary chef Julia Child washed her poultry — scientists consistently agree that rinsing chicken is dangerous.

A report from the US Department of Agriculture released on Tuesday is the latest in a long line of research to link poultry washing to an increased risk of becoming ill. That’s because raw chicken is often contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria, as well as Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Cooking chicken at 165 degrees Fahrenheit is all you need to destroy these bacteria and make the meal safe to consume.

Meanwhile, washing chicken easily spreads the bacteria to other surfaces and foods, increasing the likelihood of an unsuspecting encounter that causes people to become sick.

Want to know why you shouldn’t wash chicken? Watch where the germs go in this new CDC video. #FoodSafety https://t.co/TsOrI1FpGj pic.twitter.com/qkJOptArGT — CDC (@CDCgov) August 20, 2019

This investigation was a partnership between the USDA and North Carolina State University. Overall, 300 people were asked to prepare a chicken and a salad in a test kitchen located in either the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina or in Lillington, North Carolina. All participants self-reported that they had some experience washing or rinsing raw chicken at home. Their reasons for washing included the intention to “remove blood/slime” or “because that is how a family member does it.”

These participants were broken up into two groups — one that was told before the cooking experience that washing their poultry was dangerous, and one that was not. When they started cooking, 93 percent of the first group did not end up washing their chicken, while 61 percent of the second group did.

Overall, preparing raw chicken close to a salad created a potentially dangerous scenario. Twenty-six participants who washed their chicken accidentally transferred the chicken’s bacteria to their salad lettuce. But even when people didn’t wash their chicken, 31 percent still ended up with salad that was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This cross-contamination is chalked up to “a lack of effective handwashing and contamination of the sink utensils.”

“Please keep in mind that children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk,” explains Administrator Carmen Rottenberg of USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. “Washing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous.”

The investigators also found that 60 percent of the sinks and counters in the test kitchens used by the chicken-washers were contaminated with bacteria as well. Furthermore, 14 percent of these surfaces remained contaminated even after they were cleaned.

Luckily, no one ate any of the food prepared in the test kitchen.

The report additionally notes that, while it’s popular to brine poultry in salt water, vinegar, or lemon juice, that practice only flavors the chicken. It does not destroy bacteria, and that bacteria, in turn, contributes to millions of cases of foodborne illnesses that strike Americans each year.

If you really want to get the slime off your chicken, the best thing to do is to pat the area down with a paper towel and wash your hands as soon as possible."
GOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458474-republican-oversight-report-shows-interior-head-met-with-groups,"Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a report Thursday examining Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s calendar and alleged conflicts of interest in an effort to counter an ongoing investigation by Democrats.

But the report appears to confirm Bernhardt met with a group he recused himself from dealing with as part of his ethics pledge.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have yet to release a report, but Republicans launched their own probe after they said Democrats launched an investigation without consulting them and issued an “unprecedented and overbroad initial document request.”

Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for a number of oil and gas companies, has been under fire from Democrats and environmental groups since joining the Trump administration as deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior (DOI). Democrats argue his background leaves him with a wealth of conflicts of interest, and have accused him of violating public records laws with how he

manages his calendar

.

The GOP report lists a number of findings, the majority of which state that, “contrary to allegations,” Bernhardt is not mismanaging his calendar, obfuscating meetings or violating ethics laws. Republicans instead accused Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsGOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients Nadler asks other House chairs to provide records that would help panel in making impeachment decision Nikki Haley voices 'complete support' for Pence MORE (D-Md.) and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) of using “cherry-picked information to create a false impression"" about transparency at Interior.

“This interim staff report sets the record straight about the allegations levied against Bernhardt and DOI. The record is clear that contrary to public allegations of wrongdoing, DOI and Bernhardt have acted appropriately and ethically in maintaining and preserving the Secretary’s calendar records, as well as making them publicly available,” the GOP report said.

But Bernhardt's critics say the report shows he took meetings with former clients.

One part of the report aims to dissect a meeting of interest to Democrats involving Bernhardt and nine oil and gas companies.

That included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA), a division of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA).

“LMOGA appears to have an association to an entity on Bernhardt’s recusal list, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, but it does not appear that this association would require a recusal in all circumstances,” the report said.

Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, which has criticized Bernhardt’s ethics record, said the secretary should not meet with a division of a group on his recusal list.

“They don’t ‘appear to have an affiliation’ — they are part of USOGA,” Weiss said. “They are on Bernhardt's recusal list.”

A spokesperson for Interior said another oil company, Statoil, did not attend the meeting because of advice from Interior ethics officials.

""Secretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he takes his ethics pledge very seriously. He seeks advice from career ethics officials before taking any meeting involving external parties and strictly follows their advice and guidance,"" a spokesman for the agency told The Hill.

The Hill has reached out to Oversight Republicans for further comment on the LMOGA meeting.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee did not respond to request for comment, but Oversight Democrats say the report from their Republican colleagues left many questions unanswered.

“The Republican Staff Report provides cover for the Trump Administration’s secrecy. The Committee still has unanswered questions about who Secretary David Bernhardt met with, when, and why. The Committee is also concerned about how the Department maintains records of Secretary Bernhardt’s meetings, as well as its compliance with FOIA, which remains a serious problem,” Cummings said in a statement to The Hill.

Interior has been under fire for a number of actions critics say make the department less transparent, from a public records policy that would give political hires more influence over what documents are released to leaving controversial meetings off of Bernhardt’s public calendar.

Interior previously outlined how meeting requests would be vetted by ethics officials before being added to the schedule on a Google document. Some meetings were added to the public calendar, but others were placed on “daily cards” used to outline Bernhardt’s schedule.

“Bernhardt’s calendars are not created to be public documents, but instead used as an internal method of allocating his time,” the report said.

House Democrats have questioned whether the method violates public record-keeping laws, but Interior said an outside review found the process did not result is destruction of federal records.

""We are pleased the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) found the Department of the Interior to be in full compliance with records management laws. We appreciate their thorough and professional review in response to Congressional inquiries,” Interior told The Hill in July.

The GOP report includes high praise for Bernhardt, saying he “is improving the ‘anemic’ ethics environment of the Obama administration” and repeatedly lists witness testimony saying Bernhardt has not violated ethics or public record keeping laws.

Weiss said the report cherry-picks interviews and hopes that all of them will be released publicly.

“This is truly a ridiculous document that reads like it was written by Bernhardt himself,” he said.

"Treasury yield curve inverts after China tariff pledge, Powell speech, and Trump trade tweets",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Sunny Oh'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-tick-higher-ahead-of-powell-speech-2019-08-23,"U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply on Friday after China announced more tariffs on imports of U.S. goods, Federal Reserve chair Powell indicated that lower interest rates were possible, and President Trump “ordered” American companies home, creating even more uncertainty for business planning.

Longer term yields also fell faster than short term yields, inverting the yield curve again.

What are Treasurys doing?

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -5.40% fell 9 basis points to 1.523%, its lowest close since August 2016, contributing to a weekly decline of 1.7 basis points.

The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, -5.87% slumped 7.8 basis points to 1.528%, paring its week long rise to 4.9 basis points. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -3.95% plunged 8.8 basis points to 2.018%, trimming its weekly rise to 1.7 basis points. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.

The 2-year note yield closed above the 10-year note yield for the first time since 2007, inverting the so-called yield curve. A lasting inversion of the yield curve can serve as a recession indicator. A recession followed after the last seven inversions of the 2-year/10-year spread.

Opinion: The Fed should heed the bond market and slash interest rates

What’s driving Treasurys?

Government bonds rallied and stocks slumped after China’s finance ministry on Friday said it would impose tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods, staggered over two stages. The first batch of tariffs would kick in at Sep. 1, with the second batch coming in at Dec. 15.

Federal Reserve chair Powell in a planned speech said the U.S. central bank would “act as appropriate”, and that he was aware of the downside risks to the U.S. economy including slower global economic growth and trade policy tensions. He, however, held back from promising outright to lower interest rates.

Still, traders on the fed fund futures market all but expect a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, according to CME Group data.

President Donald Trump fired back in tweets describing Powell and Chinese President Xi Jinping as enemies, and “ordered” U.S. companies to start moving their supply chains out of China.

The S&P 500 SPX, -2.59% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.37% sank on Friday, putting key equity benchmarks on track for losses this week.

Earlier this week, several members of the Federal Open Market Committee including Kansas City Fed President Esther George expressed their opposition to further interest rate cuts. They felt slowing but still healthy economic conditions did not necessitate easier monetary policy.

On the side of the monetary policy doves, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he would support more interest rate cuts to serve as insurance against growth risks from a contracting manufacturing sectors.

What did market participants’ say?

“Post Powell comments this morning, the rates market’s feeling is that a 25 basis point rate cut for September is completely baked in. The market has gained more comfort on that,” Gary Cameron, portfolio manager at Garda Capital Partners, told MarketWatch.

“As regards to the China tariff story, it doesn’t look like there’s any resolution coming any time soon on the trade front,” said Cameron."
"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas — A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

In this Aug. 17, 2019, file photo provided by the Washington County, Arkansas Sheriff's Department, Robert Levy is pictured in a booking photo. Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

U.S. Attorney Kees said at a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) said that ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the chemical can produce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness after only 30 minutes, according to CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas, affiliate KFSM-TV. The NCBI also reportedly said that the effects can persist until the next day, and can include daylong sleeping and weeks of recovery.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."

(Photo by Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public Media)

Protesters stood outside the Dena’ina Center Tuesday. Inside, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency addressed a luncheon sponsored by the Resource Development Council. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler spoke of easing regulations on industry. He talked about hot-button issues, like narrowing the definition of wetlands and chemical pollutants in drinking water.

He didn’t say a word about the hottest Alaska conflict facing the EPA: the proposed Pebble Mine, the project that draws protesters to nearly every relevant forum.

For over a decade, Bristol Bay fishing communities have been campaigning against the proposed gold and copper mine, though some Alaskans, including villagers closer to site, say they’d welcome the jobs.

In the latest turn on Pebble, the publication E&E News reported last week that political staffers at EPA headquarters watered down the concerns raised by scientists in the regional EPA office about the adequacy of the environmental review of the proposal.

The EPA is in a powerful position. It has the right to veto Pebble’s application, even if the Corps of Engineers wants to greenlight the mine.

But the head of the EPA says the decision won’t be his. Wheeler used to work at a law firm hired by Pebble, so he needs to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

“So far, you all are the first people to have raised Pebble to me,” he told reporters at the Dena’ina Center. “But if people do raise it, I just explain that under my ethics recusal with the agency, which I abide by, I can’t discuss Pebble mine.”

How the EPA decides whether to exercise its veto power is something mine developers and opponents are watching closely.

Wheeler left the decision to the EPA’s top lawyer, who Wheeler says is working with the agency’s Region 10 administrator, Chris Hladick. Hladick is an Alaskan who has worked in commercial fishing towns. Mine opponents worry he, and the scientists at Region 10, will be steamrolled.

Hladick says a team of 40 staffers worked on the document reviewing the Pebble environmental impact statement, and he says nothing out of the ordinary occurred.

“Anything that you do at the EPA comes with consensus of headquarters,” he said.

Region 10 was still able to produce a long document finding fault with the environmental statement on the mine.

“Yeah, 170 pages of comments,” Hladick said. “They’re pretty substantial.”

EPA’s critique hit home with at least one key player: Sen. Lisa Murkowski says the document Region 10 issued has her doubting that the environmental review of Pebble’s plan has been sufficiently rigorous.

“This is substantive,” she said of the criticism. “This is considerable. And it needs to be addressed. And if it can’t be addressed, there shouldn’t be a permit that issues.”

Wheeler was supposed to speak Wednesday at the Kenai Classic Roundtable in Soldotna but a spokesman said he had to cancel due to fire-related transportation concerns."

(CNN) - A Department of Justice office sent its employees, including immigration judges, a daily news briefing that included a link to a blog featuring racial and anti-Semitic slurs, according to a letter sent by an immigration judges union.

The department's Executive Office for Immigration Review sent an office-wide collection of ""news"" items on Monday -- which the agency says is compiled by a contractor -- that included the link from the white nationalist website VDare, the letter states.

The incident was first reported by BuzzFeed.

The National Association of Immigration Judges wrote in a letter that several member judges found the content ""offensive.""

""The August 19, 2019 morning news briefings contained 'news' from a website known for publishing white nationalist ideology and Anti-Semitic tropes,"" the group wrote. ""NAIJ has received numerous complaints from judges across the nation who found the blog offensive and equated having it on the official (office) website to working in a hostile work environment.""

The union called VDare ""a website that supports white nationalism and has been found to be a 'hate website,' "" and requested that the office remove the post, apologize to all employees and prevent such content from appearing in future materials.

Union President Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor added that ""we're hopeful that the agency will take immediate corrective action.""

Kathryn Mattingly, the assistant press secretary for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, said the office's morning news briefings sent to employees are compiled by a contractor.

""The blog post should not have been included,"" she said. ""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms."""
Federal judge approves DHS request to force feed immigrant detainee on hunger strike,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/458493-federal-judge-approves-dhs-request-to-force-feed-immigrant-detainee-on-hunger,"A federal judge in San Diego approved Thursday a request from the Department of Homeland Security to force-feed and hydrate an immigrant detainee on hunger strike.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the 41-year-old man, a Russian citizen, has not eaten since Aug. 4 and has consumed only water, though he has refused to tell officials at the ICE facility how much.

The man is also refusing any medical examination, the clinical director at the Otay Mesa Detention Center said in a declaration.

The physician indicated in federal filings that they are concerned the detainee could suffer serious health problems due to the ongoing hunger strike.

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw approved ICE’s request to restrain the man if necessary to perform a medical examination and forcefully feed and hydrate him.

“The Court finds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in showing that its interests in preserving life and discharging its duties to care for those in its custody outweigh any interest Defendant might have in expressing himself through a hunger strike,” she wrote in the order.

The Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Daily Beast identified the man as Evgenii Ivanov. He has reportedly lost 27 pounds and refused 51 meals since his stay began.

Ivanov has been in immigration proceedings since November. His next court appearance is scheduled for the end of next month."
