"2020 Dems unleash profane attacks on Trump, Republicans over mass shootings",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-dems-unleash-profane-attacks-on-trump-republicans-over-mass-shootings,"President Trump’s remarks Monday condemning the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton did little to quell the anger from 2020 Democratic hopefuls who are blaming his rhetoric as well as inaction on gun control in part for the violence, as they level uncensored attacks on the president and Republicans in Congress.

In the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings that left at least 31 dead, the Democratic presidential candidates have dropped the usual decorum surrounding even tense policy debates like gun control, using coarse language to demonstrate their exasperation over the GOP response to gun violence and their calls for new gun control measures.

TRUMP CONDEMNS ‘WHITE SUPREMACY,’ CALLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN REFORMS AFTER DOUBLE MASS SHOOTINGS

“Listening to the president,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said Monday after Trump’s speech, in comments shared on Twitter by his campaign manager. “Such a bulls—t soup of ineffective words.”

Another candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, on Monday tweeted “Fck me” after Trump mistakenly, at one point in his speech, said the Ohio shooting took place in Toledo. (It happened in Dayton.)

For Ryan, the language appears to be part of a deliberate approach: Earlier Monday, the longshot candidate went on CNN and tore into Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying, ""Mitch McConnell needs to get off his a-- and do something.” On Sunday, he also tweeted, “Republicans need to get their s--- together and stop pandering to the NRA. Period.”

Other Democrats trying to weigh in amid a storm of political reaction, like former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, are taking a similar approach. O’Rourke, who represented El Paso, the site of the shooting in Texas on Saturday, expressed his unvarnished anger when asked if he thinks Trump can make the situation better.

“What do you think?” O’Rourke reportedly shot back at the press. “You know the s--- he’s been saying. He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. I don’t know, like, members of the press, what the f---?”

Democratic leaders in Congress have called on Trump to support new gun restrictions and for McConnell to allow a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate on Democrat-supported gun control language that has passed in the House.

“In February, the new Democratic House Majority promptly did its duty and passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which is supported by more than 90 percent of the American people and proven to save lives,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement after Trump’s speech. “However, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has called himself the ‘grim reaper’ and refuses to act on this bipartisan legislation.”

They added: “It is incumbent upon the Senate to come back into session to pass this legislation immediately.”

In his speech Monday, Trump did not call for explicit changes to gun laws beyond so-called ""red flag laws"" that would take guns from those deemed a public risk. However, he said he is open and ready to listen to ideas ""that will actually work.""

But in a statement that riled Democrats, he said: “Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.""

He’s Getting Worse,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Jeffrey Goldberg', 'Editor In Chief Of']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/trump-getting-worse/595453/,"It was then that he was interrupted by a woman in the crowd. “Shoot them!” she yelled.

The president found this funny, as did his audience. “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that stuff.” He stopped for a moment to take in the crowd’s roaring approval. “Only in the Panhandle!” he repeated.

It is worth pausing on the choice that was available to the president at that moment. Trump was faced by a person in the crowd who argued for the murder of immigrants. He could have, in the manner of John McCain, used a foul moment to teach a lesson about the moral necessity of nonviolence and rhetorical restraint. But he is in many ways McCain’s characterological opposite, and so he encouraged—in the greasy, joking-not-joking style he has perfected—the normalization of violence.

This most recent phase of the Trump presidency is the most dangerous so far. He has, of course, encouraged violence, or suggested its efficacy, on many occasions in the past. In March, in an interview with Breitbart News, he made it plain that he was sympathetic to those of his supporters who might feel compelled to become violent on his behalf. “I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough—until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.” And he has spoken about the press in such a way as to possibly stimulate thoughts of violence among his more fervent adherents.

But in this latest phase, his rhetoric has become particularly sweeping. Brown people in general have become his targets. And there is no reason to hope that he will reform. His followers reward his radicalism, and his handlers are among the most cynical figures in American political history. His aide Kellyanne Conway tweeted on Sunday, “Working as one to understand depraved evil & to eradicate hate is everyone’s duty. Unity. Let’s do this.” And his daughter Ivanka wrote, in a way that hints at a permanent separation from reality, “White supremacy, like all other forms of terrorism, is an evil that must be destroyed.” And, of course, there is no one of any influence in his party who is willing to confront him.

I watched the video recording of the rally in Panama City shortly after reading the El Paso killer’s so-called manifesto. It is a document littered with phrases and rhetorical devices injected into mainstream discourse by the president and his supporters—talk of a “Hispanic invasion,” accusations that Democrats support “open borders,” and the like. As Trump faces the possibility that he will lose the presidency next year, he may become more enraged, and more willing to deploy the rhetoric of violence as a way to keep his followers properly motivated. The Panama City speech was an important moment in Trump’s ongoing effort to make the American presidency a vehicle in the cause of marginalizing and frightening racial minorities; the killings are a possible (and predictable) consequence of such rhetoric."
New York Post front page editorial urges President Trump to ‘ban weapons of war’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brian Flood', 'Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-post-trump-ban-weapons-war,"The New York Post urged President Trump to “ban weapons of war” with a front-page message and editorial calling for action on the heels of tragic mass shootings that occurred over the weekend in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.

“People all across the nation are scared; many feel like the country is spinning out of control. They’re looking to their leaders for more than prayers,” the Post’s editorial board wrote. “America is terrified.”

OHIO SHOOTING VICTIMS INCLUDE GUNMAN'S SISTER, MOTHER OF TWO WHO WAS A NURSING STUDENT

The editorial said that Trump is “positioned to assuage that fear” and the president is “a pragmatic centrist, someone who knows there is a vast majority of Americans who are not to the extreme left or right on this issue.”

Americans simply want “the killings to stop,” the Post wrote.

The editorial then notes that Trump has received support from the National Rifle Association and frequently praises the Second Amendment but there is “ample” room to make a change.

“Come up with answers. Now. Beginning with the return of an assault weapons ban,” the editorial board wrote. “This ban would only be part of the response: Keep improving background checks, find wiser approaches to mental health, get every state to pass a red-flag law (do a federal one, too, even if issuing these restraining orders is mainly the job of state courts).”

The Post called for “bipartisan action” in order to come up with a prompt solution to gun violence.

“Maybe some sort of summit of top political leaders; maybe a high-powered commission full of people without political ambition; maybe both, and more,” the editorial board wrote. “One of the big reasons that crime has fallen so far in New York City is a crackdown on guns. Their ownership is restricted, and the NYPD is focused on getting illegal ones off the street. Gun control works.”

The paper then mocked the “guns don’t kill people, people do” cliché.

“The twisted and the evil can kill a lot more people when handed a murder machine. Our Founding Fathers gave us the right to bear arms in a time of muskets. They did not foresee a time when one 21-year-old could kill 20 people in the span of minutes thanks to poisonous beliefs and an assault weapon,” the Post wrote. “It does not have to be this way. It should not have to be this way. Mr. President, do something — help America live without fear.”

The Most Dangerous American Idea,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Adam Serwer', 'Staff Writer At']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/reagan-nixon-trump-white-nationalism/595465/,"It’s also a belief that continues to shape American politics, one held by the current occupant of the White House. President Donald Trump’s racial conception of American citizenship, and his denigration of nonwhite immigrants from “shithole countries,” is but an extension of Reagan’s and Nixon’s logic. It forms the moral core of much of Fox News’s programming, which warns white Americans day in and day out that their country is being stolen by minorities. And it justifies the long-term efforts of Republican elites to rig democracy to their advantage, by limiting or diluting the political power of nonwhite Americans through gerrymandering and disenfranchisement. The significance of Reagan’s and Nixon’s remarks is not simply what they said. It is that their conversation shows that, although Trumpism is in some ways unique, what Americans confront today is not nearly so alien to their history and culture as many might assume.

When the former abolitionist Horace Greeley turned against Reconstruction, he nearly took the whole country with him.

The powerful owner of the New-York Tribune was once a reliable Republican partisan. But in the May 1871 issue of the Tribune, an anonymous correspondent attacked the Reconstruction government in South Carolina as emblematic of other Republican-controlled state legislatures throughout the South, a place where black Americans, “a class just released from slavery, and incompetent, without guidance, to exercise the simplest duties of citizenship,” had become “the governing class in South Carolina, and a class more totally unfit to govern does not exist upon the face of the earth.”

Those words reflected Greeley’s own views, according to the historian Eric Foner, who writes in Reconstruction that Greeley saw black people as an “easy, worthless race, taking no thought for the morrow.”

Although he expressed them as an attack on the governing abilities of the freedmen, Greeley’s true objections were ideological, as the historian Heather Cox Richardson writes in Death of Reconstruction. After the Civil War and emancipation, black Americans sought to enjoy their newfound liberty. They wanted to run their own businesses, they wanted to establish schools for their children, and they wanted to tend their own land and manage their own fates.

But white elites still held economic power in Southern states, even if their political power had been diminished by the enfranchisement of the freedmen. For the masses of the freedmen to become more than a captive—if nominally free—labor force for white employers would require government intervention. And for wealthy, conservative Republicans like Greeley, and the white-supremacist Democrats who had lost power in the South, that kind of state intervention on behalf of workers and the poor was antithetical to the American system of government."

10-year Treasury yield plunges below 1.74% after China counters US trade action,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-nearly-3-year-low.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 1.74% on Monday, its lowest level since November 2016, after China countered new U.S. tariffs, escalating the protracted trade war between globe's two biggest economies.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, used as a benchmark for mortgage and auto loan rates, fell 12 basis points to 1.735%, its lowest level since Nov. 9, 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9 basis points to 2.293%, while the rate on the 2-year Treasury dropped 12 basis points to 1.581%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The 10-year Treasury note yield, down more than 30 basis points in August, returned less than the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.017%.

The bid for Treasurys and pivot away from stocks came after actions by China fueled a new wave of trade anxiety across global markets.

China, which has in the past tinkered with its currency to boost its exports, allowed the yuan to fall to its lowest level in more than a decade, making Chinese exports cheaper. The onshore yuan broke above 7 per U.S. dollar, drawing the online ire of President Donald Trump, who voiced his complaint on Twitter.

""China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!""

Trump's criticism on Monday came less than three months after his Treasury Department decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Despite promises to label Beijing as such during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the administration has passed on five opportunities to do so thus far.

Bloomberg News also reported that Beijing has asked state-owned companies to refrain from buying U.S. agricultural goods.

These moves came four days after Trump announced that the U.S. on Sept. 1 would impose a 10% tariff the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had eluded duties. The news pushed the S&P 500 to its worst weekly performance of the year. The S&P 500 dropped 31% last week. The Dow had its second-biggest weekly drop of 2019 last week, sliding 2.6%."
"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"

Proposed Bill Wants Tech Companies To Pay Out the Nose if DOJ Inquiry Uncovers Antitrust Violations,https://gizmodo.com,"['Alyse Stanley', 'About The Author', 'Nights', 'Weekend Reporter']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/proposed-bill-wants-tech-companies-to-pay-out-the-nose-1836939956,"Image: Charlie Neibergall (AP)

U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal proposed antitrust legislation Friday that, if passed, could give the Justice Department’s recently launched probe into monopoly concerns among big tech companies some serious teeth if any violations come to light.

The two Democrats call it the “Monopolization Deterrence Act,” Reuters reported. This legislation would grant the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission the ability to levy civil penalties when companies break antitrust law, up to 15 percent of the company’s total U.S. revenue or 30 percent of its U.S. revenue in affected markets.

Certain companies have grown so powerful that the fear of earning an injunction for monopolization offenses no longer works as a successful deterrent, prompting the need for “serious financial consequences,” Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for next year’s presidential election, said in a statement about the bill on her website.

“Our legislation would empower our antitrust watchdogs with new tools to deter monopolization of market power and hold bad actors accountable,” Blumenthal said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “American consumers and workers are being crushed by corporate consolidation, and our outdated laws have failed to keep pace with our modern economy.”

Whether the bill specifically names Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or any other companies involved in the Justice Department’s probe, they seem like likely targets of this legislation given its timing. Klobuchar also previously headed efforts in June to provide Congress with more details about these investigations before they launched, according to her office’s statement.

As part of its review, the Justice Department plans to analyze how these big tech companies have secured their market power and whether their practices have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,” per a DOJ statement.

The move comes just weeks after the FTC hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which breached roughly 87 million Facebook users’ personal data. Considering the company made $15.08 billion in revenue in this year’s first quarter alone, Democrats at the time said the commission “failed miserably” in its ruling. While privacy violations and antitrust violations are two entirely different beasts, the way this new bill specifies possible fines as a proportion of a company’s earnings could very well be in response to their dissatisfaction with how the FTC’s handled punishing the big tech company previously."
Trump calls on DOJ to work with social media companies to identify mass shooters,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/456183-trump-calls-for-doj-to-work-with-social-media-companies-to-identify-mass,"President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker calls Trump's address on mass shootings 'bull---t soup' A plea to progressive political pundits: Stop wringing your hands GOP state lawmaker: 'Republican Party is enabling white supremacy in our country' MORE on Monday called for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to work closely with social media companies to identify potential mass shooters in remarks that largely focused on how technology can enable real-world violence.

During a speech in which the president condemned white supremacy and hatred following two mass shootings this weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump said the internet plays an important role in radicalizing mass shooters.

The alleged 21-year-old shooter in El Paso allegedly posted an anti-immigrant manifesto to fringe social networking platform 8chan shortly before he killed 21 people and injured dozens more on Saturday. This is the third mass shooting in which suspects are believed to have posted hateful content to 8chan before committing murders this year.

""The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,"" Trump said. ""We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts.""

""We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start,"" he said. ""The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored and they will not be ignored.""

He announced that he is directing the Justice Department ""to work in partnership with local, state and federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike.""

Echoing other Republican lawmakers who have spoken out in the days since the shooting, Trump also directed some of the blame for violence in the country toward video games, despite researchers concluding that they likely do not directly cause young people to become more violent.

Scientific studies have been unable to identify a link between violent video games and violent behavior. But lawmakers and officials have continued to call for a crackdown on video games in the wake of mass shootings.

Following of the Parkland, Fla., shooting last year, Trump argued that video games can inspire violence in the real world. Shortly after, the president met with representatives of the video game industry and critics of video game violence to hear their concerns.

""We must stop the glorification of violence in our society,"" Trump said on Monday. ""This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace.""

The Entertainment Software Industry, the video game industry’s top lobbying arm, said in a statement that others countries that also enjoy video games ""do not contend with the tragic levels of violence"" seen in the U.S.

“More than 165 million Americans enjoy video games, and billions of people play video games worldwide,"" the statement to The Hill said. ""Yet other societies, where video games are played as avidly, do not contend with the tragic levels of violence that occur in the U.S.""

The shooting in El Paso was followed by another mass shooting early Sunday morning in Dayton, which left nine people dead and almost 30 injured. Investigators are still looking into the shooter's motives.

""It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence,"" Trump said. ""We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.""

The remarks come as the president has continued to attack the country’s top social media companies including Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook, which he claims are biased against conservatives.

Trump has pledged that he will take action against the companies and held a “social media summit” earlier this year dedicated to criticizing their conduct. None of the companies were invited to the event.

Trump himself has come under fire for stoking racial tensions, as he has often warned of an invasion by immigrants and spoken against immigration from Mexico. Both themes were the centerpiece of the 8chan manifesto posted on Saturday.

The shooting in El Paso has raised larger questions about the role of fringe social media networks, such as 8chan, in enabling violence. The Anti-Defamation League has referred to those websites as “round-the-clock white supremacist rallies,” pointing out they can act as a breeding ground for extremist ideologies.

On Sunday, the head of Cloudflare — the U.S. company that helps keep 8chan online — said his company will stop hosting the fringe online platform known for supporting white supremacists.

Joe diGenova: Barr's Comey decision was the right call. But this is just the beginning,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Digenova', 'Joseph Digenova Was Us Attorney For The District Of Columbia', 'An Independent Counsel.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-digenova-barr-james-comey-leaks-decision,"The decision not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey over his deliberate leaks to the media isn’t a sign of weakness or lack of will, but of the professionalism and well-reasoned restraint of President Trump’s Department of Justice.

Attorney General Bill Barr’s number one goal since taking the helm at the DOJ has been to restore the impartial and professional ethos that has characterized that agency for more than 200 years.

He is working diligently to cleanse it of the stain of politically driven vindictiveness that Obama-era officials created by grossly mishandling the Clinton email investigation, and then, even more egregiously, orchestrating the series of events that led to the Russiagate witch hunt.

ROBERT MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY THE NUMBERS

Before this “investigation of the investigators” is over, there will undoubtedly be many cases of misconduct that warrant criminal prosecution. Comey’s, however, was not one of them.

What Comey did -- release private memos made in the course of his employment as FBI director to politically damage the president of the United States, who had just fired him for unrelated misconduct -- was absolutely outrageous, and totally unbecoming of the leader of this country’s premier criminal investigatory agency. It speaks volumes about Comey’s corrupt character and further illustrates why both President Trump and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Comey was no longer fit to serve in that role.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

In this case, however, even that deplorable conduct did not rise to the level that was possible to prosecute criminally. The career prosecutors assigned to the case told Fox News that this “wasn’t a close call,” and I can see why. The confidential nature of the memos was too ambiguous. The intent element was too hard to prove.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

That does not mean, as some are now claiming, that the decision not to prosecute in this particular case is a vindication of Comey, a defeat for the president, or an end to the inquiry surrounding these leaks.

The quest for truth is far more important than the pursuit of retribution against an already-disgraced FBI official whose behavior in office was unbecoming of any public official. There are many of us who want to see James Comey before a jury or in a jail cell, but like Attorney General Barr, I’m more interested in seeing a full and complete accounting of the malfeasance that took place at the DOJ during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.

The release of a pending report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz is, by all accounts, imminent. The product of more than 16 months of investigation, that report will cover far more devious schemes than Comey’s leaking -- Horowitz is finally going to reveal the truth about the dishonest handling of FISA spy-warrant applications against Trump associates.

Horowitz, like Barr, is a true professional. His intrepid work revealed to the world the whole picture of Comey’s number two, Andy McCabe, whose own improper leaks to the media got him fired just days before he would have been eligible for a government pension. It was his extensive investigation through which we learned the full extent of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and DOJ lawyer Lisa Page’s anti-Trump text exchanges that disqualified Strzok from further participation in Special Counsel Mueller’s probe.

The investigation of the investigators is only just now coming into focus. We already know there was wrongdoing throughout the Obama DOJ, and that it continued among the holdovers from that era after the 2016 election -- and we know that it fueled the most pernicious conspiracy theory in modern American history. Some of that wrongdoing may well be prosecutable.

If and when such cases arise, the president’s supporters will be glad that Attorney General Barr and his team exercised such restraint in the Comey case. The American people will now be assured that any prosecutions that do go forward will be well-founded, readily provable, and completely devoid of the taint of politics.

We can all now appreciate a return to integrity at the DOJ. The American people deserve nothing less.

Commerce Department names rural development director,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.al.com/business/2019/08/commerce-department-names-rural-development-director.html,"Alabama’s rural communities now have a state position devoted to helping with economic development projects.

Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield announced today that Brenda Tuck has been hired as the department’s first rural development manager.

Tuck will assist rural counties and communities in competing for job-creating projects, providing technical assistance and training.

It’s an area she knows well. She previously served in economic development positions in Marengo, Dallas and Wilcox counties and has been regional workforce council liaison to the Commerce Department’s Workforce Development Division. She also spent seven years as a partner with Selma consulting firm Alford & Associates and five years in economic development at Pioneer Electric Cooperative.

Tuck said she looks forward to working with rural counties and their leaders.

“Rural communities in Alabama can benefit from having a go-to person who can connect them with the resources they need to improve their economic development prospects,” Tuck said.

Alabama in recent years has made a priority of rural economic development through several initiatives. In 2015 the state began offering incentives to qualified projects in targeted counties as a bid to spur rural job creation. The Commerce Department says about 16 projects have qualified, with about $1 billion in investments and 1,400 jobs. This year the Alabama Legislature approved increasing the number of counties eligible for enhanced incentives.

Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said Tuck’s background makes her “the ideal choice to help rural communities navigate the economic development process.”

“Brenda has extensive experience working on the front lines of economic development in rural Alabama counties, so she knows the specific challenges these areas face when it comes to competing for projects,” Canfield said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it welcomed news of a ceasefire in Northwest Syria - the last rebel bastion in the country - and urged for an end to attacks on civilians.

Last week Syrian media reported that the ceasefire would take place as long as rebel fighters implement the terms of a de-escalation agreement brokered last year by Russia and Turkey.

The wave of violence in northwest Syria since late April has killed more than 400 civilians and forced more than 440,000 to flee toward the Turkish border, according to the United Nations.

“The United States believes there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and only a political solution can ensure a stable and secure future for all Syrians,” the State Department said in a statement.

“We further believe the only viable path to a political solution is the U.N.-led political process in Geneva, including constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” the statement said.

The United States will support the work of U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the United Nations to advance a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that would create a permanent, peaceful, and political end to the conflict, the State Department added.

The region - including Idlib province and parts of nearby Hama - was part of the last major stronghold of armed opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to reclaim all of Syria.

The Department also commended efforts by Turkey and Russia to restore the cease fire they agreed in September 2018."
DOJ will not prosecute Comey for leaking memos after IG referral: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-will-not-prosecute-comey-for-leaking-memos-after-ig-referral-source,"The Justice Department has decided against prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey for leaking classified information following a referral from the department’s inspector general, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

COMEY HEARING: EX-FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE LEAKED MEMO TO SPUR SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTMENT

Comey penned memos memorializing his interactions with President Trump in the days leading up to his firing. He then passed those documents to a friend, Columbia University Law Professor Daniel Richman, who gave them to The New York Times. Comey admitted to that arrangement during congressional testimony.

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential prosecution as part of an internal review.

But one of the key factors leading to the DOJ declining to prosecute apparently was the fact that the two memos were labeled “confidential” after he set in motion the chain of events that led to them ending up with the press.

Richman, now serving as an attorney to Comey, told Fox News he had ""no comment"" on the prosecutorial decision on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the release of Horowitz’s report is “imminent,” according to another source familiar with the investigation.

The report related to Comey’s leaks is separate from Horowitz’s review of alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses. That report’s release is delayed, according to sources, due to the potential components of Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into alleged improper government surveillance.

Horowitz publicly confirmed last year that his office was investigating Comey for his handling of classified information as part of memos he shared documenting his discussions with the president.

In June 2018, during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Horowitz said he “received a referral on that from the FBI,” and was “handling that referral.”

IG CONFIRMS COMEY UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER MEMO HANDLING

“We will issue a report when the matter is complete and consistent with the law and rules,” Horowitz said at the time.

Comey last year also confirmed to Fox News that the inspector general’s office had interviewed him with regard to memos, but downplayed the questions over classified information as “frivolous”—saying the real issue was whether he complied with internal policies.

Fox News learned last year that Horowitz was looking at whether classified information was given to unauthorized sources as part of a broader review of Comey’s communications outside the bureau—including media contact.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information. Instead, he compared the process to keeping “a diary.”

“I didn’t consider it part of an FBI file,” Comey told Fox News' Bret Baier last year. “It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine.”

In his testimony in June 2017 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he made the decision to document the interactions with the president in a way that would not trigger security classification.

COMEY SAYS DOJ WATCHDOG INTERVIEWED HIM OVER HANDLING OF MEMOS

But in seven Comey memos handed over to Congress in April 2018, eight of the 15 pages had redactions under classified exceptions.

Comey, during his June 2017 testimony, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

“I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,” Comey testified.

“I was worried that the media was camping at the end of my driveway, my wife and I were going away,” Comey said. “I was worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach if it was I who gave it to the media, so I asked my friend to.”

The New York Times published the report with Comey’s memos on May 16, 2017, revealing the contents of the memo which said the president asked him to shut down the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in an Oval Office meeting.

Why Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/455923-why-dave-norquist-is-the-perfect-choice-for-dods-deputy-secretary,"When the Senate confirmed David Norquist by voice vote, it not only demonstrated his overwhelming popularity on Capitol Hill but also, at long last, emplaced the top level of the Pentagon’s leadership after a half-year hiatus. Norquist, previously confirmed as Pentagon comptroller and chief financial officer, had been acting as deputy secretary ever since James Mattis James Norman MattisWhy Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary Five questions for Trump's new defense secretary on first major tour Trump taps Texas Rep.

In fact, Norquist was not even formally the acting deputy; he was “performing the duties of deputy secretary,” a weird formulation intended to comply with the terms of the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Dave Norquist has admirers beyond Capitol Hill. Equally important are his popularity inside the Pentagon, his successful tenure as Pentagon comptroller, and his broad-based experience. Both his colleagues on the E Ring — whether in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, and the Service department leaderships — and their staffs respected his judgment, even as he had to make difficult funding allocation decisions.

In addition, as chief financial officer and unlike any of his predecessors, myself included, he successfully oversaw the first-ever, department-wide audit, covering over $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities. His experience as a partner in the Kearney accounting firm, which focuses on government practice, certainly helped him in this regard. As he was the first to acknowledge, the audit was far from complete. It was by no means what is termed a “clean audit.” Nevertheless, it represented the largest audit of its kind anywhere, and for that he rightly deserved the kudos that he received.

Norquist is no mere accountant, however. He was serving as a key staffer on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee when I hired him as my deputy. He brought with him not only a fine reputation for diligence and collegiality on the Hill, but also experience in the bowels of the Pentagon as both as a presidential management intern (as the internship program was then called) and then as an Army resource analyst. He also spent time working in the United Kingdom, and his international experience proved exceedingly valuable as he took the lead in managing budget matters arising from the occupation of Iraq.

In that latter capacity, he worked closely with not only key allies, but also the leadership of the State Department’s economics bureau — no small feat at a time when the Department of Defense (DOD) and State were at loggerheads on most issues relating to Iraq.

Norquist’s background and demeanor, therefore, will serve him exceedingly well as the Defense Department’s chief operating officer and as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Mark EsperPrime minister says US won't deploy missiles in Australia New Pentagon chief says China's 'destabilizing behavior' is 'disturbing' Why Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary MORE’s stand-in when Esper is away from Washington. His in-depth knowledge of programs and budgets will ensure that DOD makes the most of the recent budget agreement that will provide the department with stable funding through fiscal year 2021. His international experience as deputy under secretary will serve him in good stead as he interacts with counterparts, both defense ministers and their deputies, worldwide. And his ability to work closely and well with other departments will perhaps provide some comity to an executive branch that often has been chaotic.

Far too many vacancies remain in the Pentagon. This is an exceedingly troublesome circumstance for a department that would have to oversee wartime operations at short notice. Nevertheless, with DOD’s top two positions filled, the civilian leadership that is essential for managing the government’s largest department, both in war and in peace, at last is firmly in place.

Dov S. Zakheim is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He was under secretary of Defense (comptroller) and chief financial officer for the Department of Defense from 2001 to 2004 and a deputy under secretary of Defense from 1985 to 1987."

EPA helps with mercury cleanup in U.P. after kids find bottle in old garage,https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/epa-helps-with-mercury-cleanup-in-up-after-kids-find-bottle-in-old-garage.html,"A mercury spill in the Upper Peninsula has been reportedly contained to the site thanks to the work of federal, local and state officials.

The spill was reported back on July 28 at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Miss City, according to local reports. Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ontonagon County Emergency Management and Western Upper Peninsula Health Department responded to the spill.

A regional spokesperson with the EPA did not immediately return MLive’s request for an update Monday morning, Aug. 5.

WLUV-TV reports the incident was reported to local law enforcement after children found a bottle containing mercury in the abandoned garage. The outlet says the children’s home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

The Daily Mining Gazette reports the children took the mercury out and played with it for what was described as “a while.” Mike Kocher, emergency services director in Ontonagon County, told the newspaper that “they just played with it” and didn’t ingest any.

The scene itself in Mass City was reportedly cleared before the weekend, but mercury levels in the air continue to be monitored.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” Kocher told ABC 10 News in the U.P.

“Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

In the event of a mercury spill larger than that of a thermometer break, the EPA advises everyone to leave the area, open all windows/doors to the outside, turn the temperature down, and to shut all doors to other parts of the house/structure.

The federal agency then advises -- in bold red text -- to not vacuum the spill and to call the local health department or fire department for the next steps.

“Any time one pound or more of mercury is released to the environment, it is mandatory to call the National Response Center,” the EPA writes on its website.

“The NRC hotline operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call 800-424-8802. Note that because mercury is heavy, only two tablespoons of mercury weigh about one pound.”"
"James Comey part of 'grand conspiracy,' Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-part-of-grand-conspiracy-joe-digenova-says,"Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova said former FBI Director James Comey is ""not out of the woods"" after the Justice Department declined to prosecute him for how he handled memos that documented interactions he had with President Trump.

In an interview on Fox News last week, diGenova said it was ""very obvious"" that top officials at the Justice Department and FBI sought to ""frame"" Trump to keep him out of the White House. He said accountability will come from a review of the Russia investigation origins being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

""Comey's not out of the woods,"" diGenova told host Laura Ingraham. ""He is the target along with a number of other people of a major criminal conspiracy investigation by John Durham. Doesn't mean he is going to be charged but ... he's right in the middle of the grand conspiracy that John Durham is investigating. I applaud what Bill Barr in dismissing — in not bringing this case.""

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz sent a referral to the DOJ about memos Comey leaked to a friend to give to the press, a move he testified was done with the hopes of sparking a special counsel investigation. Although prosecutors found the watchdog's findings compelling, they decided against prosecution under classified information protection laws because of uncertainty regarding Comey's intent.

Comey has denied leaking classified information, but two of his memos were deemed confidential, the lowest form of classification, after an FBI review.

Still, Horowitz is nearing completion of a report on alleged government abuses that began during the 2016 campaign. The investigation will likely scrutinize how Comey signed three of the four FISA applications targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, which is a focus of Horowitz's investigation. Those FBI applications relied on a dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which has largely been discredited.

Durham, at the behest of Attorney General William Barr, is conducting review of the Russia investigation's origins, and could take prosecutorial action, depending on the findings and recommendations from the independent watchdog.

""Accountability is what matters now after the disgrace that we've had where it is very obvious the DOJ and FBI under Obama — Sally Yates, James Comey, [Andrew] McCabe, all of these people tried to basically frame Donald Trump, to defrock him, to remove him from office, to prevent him from taking office,"" diGenova said.

""What we need now is accountability through disclosure, accountability, transparency, public reports, the Horowitz report, and if there are serious crimes — let's say a group of people got together and said even though we know Carter Page is innocent, we are going to lie to the FISA court so we can listen in and see if we can get stuff on the Trump people. If that happened, I'm for prosecuting that,"" he added."

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

DOJ says Mueller investigation cost $31.7 million,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-03-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-says-mueller-investigation-cost-31-7-million,"Former special counsel Robert Mueller's nearly two-year investigation into Russia's election interference cost $31.7 million, according to the Department of Justice.

The special counsel's office directly spent about $16.4 million since it was brought into the fold in May 2017. Mueller spent approximately $6.56 million in the last eight months of the probe, of which $4.12 million was personally spent from the special counsel's office, and the Justice Department used up $2.44 million to assist Mueller's work, according to CNBC.

The nearly $32 million price tag, Politico reports, covered all expenditures through May 31, two months after Mueller wrapped up his investigation and the Justice Department released his 448-page report, with redactions, detailing Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, but did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.

Though Mueller's investigation carried an expensive cost, DOJ officials would have accrued $15.3 million throughout the inquiry regardless if Mueller had been brought in to serve as special counsel. The biggest component of Mueller's receipts covered salaries and benefits, with $9.7 million allocated to the various lawyers, FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other personnel who assisted with the investigation.

Mueller's office also revealed it spent $3.1 million on rent, communications, and utilities, and $1.6 million was allocated for travel and personal transportation.

President Trump often complained that the special counsel's investigation, which he called a ""witch hunt,"" would cost more than $40 million.

""When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever?"" Trump tweeted in November. ""After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!""

When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2018

Some Democrats, such as House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, asserted that the criminal indictments of numerous individuals throughout the investigation and subsequent forfeiture of millions of dollars in personal assets effectively counteracted the total cost of the investigation.

""You secured the convictions of President Trump’s campaign chairman, his deputy campaign manager, his national security adviser, and his personal lawyer, among others,"" the New York Democrat said before Mueller’s high-profile testimony last month. ""In the Paul Manafort case alone, you recovered as much as $42 million, so that the cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero.""

It is estimated that as much as $42 million was confiscated from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted and later entered a plea deal in which he lost much of his real estate, bank accounts, and a life insurance policy.

Mueller brought more than 100 charges against three Russian companies and 34 people, including several former Trump advisers, during the investigation, which lasted from May 2017 until March 2019, although none of them had to do with conspiracy."
U.S. Presidents Relied on This Innovative Alarm Watch,https://gearpatrol.com,['Zen Love'],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://gearpatrol.com/2019/08/04/watches-you-should-know-vulcain-cricket/,"Welcome to “Watches You Should Know,” a bi-weekly (the once-every-two-weeks kind) column highlighting little-known or notable watches new and old that have interesting stories or have had a surprising impact on the industry.

It’s hard to imagine today that the rattly buzzing sound of a mechanical wristwatch alarm was once cutting-edge gadgetry. This was in the 1940s, however, and when the Vulcain Cricket was introduced, it overcame a number of technical hurdles to be loud enough, compact enough, and reliable enough to be a viable product. The first of its kind, an alarm was a genuinely useful function to have on the wrist. So much so that it found fame and took on a whole other level of status after being worn by multiple US presidents and becoming known as the “president’s watch.”

Firsts in watchmaking are always notable, but almost always require some qualification. The utility of an alarm on one’s wrist was recognized long before the Cricket, and a couple companies had produced alarm watches, but each had fatal flaws with alarms that weren’t loud enough or vibrations that adversely affected the movement. The Vulcain Cricket was not technically the first alarm watch when it was introduced in 1947, but the first to be practically successful (pocket watches notwithstanding).

Vulcain had to develop a special movement with multiple unique features in order to make the Cricket viable, let alone interesting and cool. The Caliber 120 featured one mainspring barrel to power timekeeping, as most mechanical wristwatches do, but also a separate one solely for the alarm due to its heavier power demands. The hand-wound movement offered 42 hours of power reserve for the timekeeping, and allowed the alarm to sound for around 25 seconds. Particularly clever is how clean and simple the watch remained despite its complex functionality: turn the crown one direction to wind the time’s mainspring and the other direction to wind the alarm’s mainspring.

The volume needed to be at least sufficient to wake you up, and this was achieved with a combination of solutions. The sound itself comes from a tiny hammer striking a metal “membrane.” It is then amplified via a cover which fits over the movement and, to let the sound resonate and escape, the case back is acoustically designed with holes similar to those seen in some string instruments. The hammer strikes around 1,300 times in the roughly 25 seconds of its loud, continuous ring until it audibly winds down — and it further vibrates palpably on the wrist.

All this results in a watch that looks pretty traditional, with only the addition of another hand on the dial for the alarm and a pusher at 2 o’clock that distinguishes it from time-only watches. The pusher is used to activate the alarm, stop it (important), and put the watch into alarm setting mode. One notable caveat is that the alarm can be set in ten-minute increments, but not down to an exact, individual minute.

The Cricket was successful and was followed by other notable alarm watches like the Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox and the Tudor Advisor. The Cricket itself also evolved with additional functions and more versions. One of the most notable such Vulcain watches was the Cricket Nautical released in 1961, a dive watch rated to 300m with an alarm that would be audible to the wearer underwater.

The office of president of the United States is full of rituals and traditions, and Vulcain was lucky enough to become part of one. After the White House Press Photographer’s Association chose a Cricket to gift Harry S. Truman a 14k gold Cricket in 1953 as he was leaving office, the alarm watch continued to be associated with US presidents. Vulcain has been clever enough to send Cricket watches to US presidents as well, but this wasn’t a simple case of product placement — Nixon, it is said, got his as a gift from the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors.

Lyndon B. Johnson clearly appreciated fine watches, as he is associated with both the Cricket and the other famous “president’s watch,” the Rolex Day Date. Johnson bought his Cricket himself in Geneva, the story goes, and had his initials, LBJ, put right on the dial. He later also bought 200 Cricket watches in bulk to give out as gifts during his time in office. There are (unsubstantiated) stories that the sound would alarm his security detail, and that he would set it to go off during meetings as an excuse to leave early. Up to the present day, presidents have been known to receive Cricket watches whether or not they are worn.

If these interesting features and stories weren’t enough to make the Cricket downright legendary, it was also the watch chosen by notable adventurers and mountain climbers. The modern Vulcain company, restarted in 2001 after the original company succumbed to the Quartz Crisis, boasts that the original Cricket’s assembly line survives. Modern versions are available today in various forms, some quite faithful to early models, and they represent a very rare current example of a mechanical alarm in a wristwatch."

Justice Department Probes Bubble Wrap Maker’s Auditor Selection Process,https://www.wsj.com,"['Maria Armental', 'Dylan Tokar', 'Maria.Armental Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-probes-bubble-wrap-makers-auditor-selectionprocess-11564778415,"Sealed Air Corp. , under investigation by federal regulators for its financial practices and audit-firm selection process, is now facing a related Justice Department probe.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based maker of packaging products such as bubble wrap said in a regulatory filing Friday it received a grand jury subpoena seeking information related to the firing of its finance chief and the selection process of its independent audit firm beginning in fiscal year 2015.

Sealed Air in June said it fired Chief Financial Officer Bill Stiehl for cause after receiving subpoenas in 2018 and 2019 from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator sought information related to how the company selected its audit firm as well as information on its accounting for income taxes, financial reporting and disclosures, according to regulatory filings.

Sealed Air switched auditors to Ernst & Young LLP in 2015, according to regulatory filings.

“EY performed its audit work with rigor, objectivity, impartiality and skepticism, in full compliance with all applicable professional standards. We stand by the quality of our work,” the firm said. “We are fully committed to the critical role we play as auditors in meeting the needs of the capital markets, protecting investors, and providing independent assurance with respect to our clients’ financial reporting.”

The subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina is the first indication Sealed Air could face criminal charges in addition to a civil enforcement action by the SEC.

Prosecutors convene a grand jury to collect evidence and to decide whether there is probable cause for an indictment. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Charlotte declined to comment.

Mr. Stiehl couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. A lawyer who has represented him didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.

“We take financial reporting controls and compliance very seriously and are fully cooperating with the regulatory authority,” Lori Chaitman, Sealed Air’s head of investor relations, said Friday during an earnings call.

Ms. Chaitman said the company wouldn’t comment beyond the securities filing, which listed the SEC and Justice Department investigations as risk factors.

In addition to potential legal costs, Sealed Air said that if the audit firm were found not to be independent, the company may have to re-audit past financial statements.

F.B.I.

No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board in 2015."
Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."
Homeland Security makes the right moves to bolster our cybersecurity,https://thehill.com,[],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/455961-homeland-security-makes-the-right-moves-to-bolster-our-cybersecurity,"If there is one thing that was learned from the 2016 presidential election, it is that protecting our election infrastructure cannot be only a passive decision. There is a need to be proactively assessing our environment to ensure that we are implementing the cybersecurity features that fortify our systems and, ultimately, our American democracy. This is where the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency comes into full play.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was inaugurated in 2018 as a component within the Department of Homeland Security. Its primary objectives are to lead cybersecurity efforts across the federal government and to work with the critical infrastructure community to help protect their networks. But it was not conceptualized solely on the basis of Russian interference. The evolving concerns that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency plans to prioritize as it is now entering its second year include supply chain, 5G networks, and election security.

Standing up the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency last fall, an effort that was started by the Obama administration but realized by President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker calls Trump's address on mass shootings 'bull---t soup' A plea to progressive political pundits: Stop wringing your hands GOP state lawmaker: 'Republican Party is enabling white supremacy in our country' MORE, has signaled cybersecurity as a priority deserving of greater resources. Top Department of Homeland Security officials had been championing the decision, advocating that the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was necessary for streamlining its goals. It is able to act more independently, like how the Federal Emergency Management Agency operates, so barriers to decision making are eliminated, and responses are more efficient and successful.

Under the leadership of Chris Krebs, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has initiated a solid roadmap outlining how it will fully mature its capabilities over the next two years. While it may appear to be acting similarly to an intelligence agency through its information sharing efforts, there is a major distinction in that it will operate transparently. This is a huge win for all its civilian, private sector, and government partners navigating the complex cybersecurity landscape.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency understands that a majority of our cybersecurity infrastructure resides in the private sector and is committed to taking actions to counter threats that extend beyond government systems. This means it will work closely with cybersecurity infrastructure entities to understand what they themselves perceive to be the greatest risks to their systems. This not only improves the efficacy of solutions, but it helps achieve buy in, which greatly strengthens efforts.

Still, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency exhibits both form and function. There are new emerging cyberthreats that are rapidly changing and advancing, including the durability of the supply chain. Cybercriminals and foreign adversaries have demonstrated the ability to exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain, gaining access to sensitive data. These perpetrators are acting strategically to disrupt our systems, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is expected to exercise collective defense to manage these risks and share actionable intelligence with important network defenders positioned to act on it.

One resource that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency now relies on is its Information and Communication Technologies Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force that is comprised of federal partners and dozens of the largest companies in the information technology and communications sectors. Its participants are crafting strong proposals to manage several weaknesses in the international technology supply chain.

It comes as no surprise that another focal point is 5G. However, with the advantages of 5G come the downsides, as there are greater opportunities for our adversaries such as China to gain access to our networks and for insecure technology to gain outsized market share. To defend against all these new threats, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency coordinates with the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Communications Commission, and the White House. This is necessary to determine risk mitigation strategies, such as mandating all 5G technology be interoperable, or banning some providers like Huawei.

But what about election security? Was that not the driving force in establishing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency? It is indeed working to expand upon the relationships with state and local election officials and voting machine vendors that emerged from the 2018 midterm elections. The Department of Homeland Security now finally recognizes elections as part of our cybersecurity infrastructure, and so engagements with these partners has been paramount to understanding how they operate. Collaboration between state and local election officials and the federal government is a major factor in incentivizing the patching of election systems and helping the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency achieve its goal of 100 percent auditability by 2020.

The Department of Homeland Security is a proven government leader by launching the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to focus on emerging cyberthreats. With this leadership comes the responsibility to integrate and coordinate with the private sector to ensure secure and sustainable partnerships. Connecting these entities will inform decision making and provide pathways for innovation and intelligence sharing.

DoD reports higher costs for National Security Space Launch program,https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://spacenews.com/dod-reports-higher-costs-for-national-security-space-launch-program/,"NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion.

WASHINGTON — In a new update to its annual report on major acquisition program spending, the Defense Department estimates the total cost of the National Security Space Launch program is up by $4.1 billion since December 2018.

In the so-called Selected Acquisition Reports, DoD estimates the total cost of a program by including what it has already spent and what it projects to spend in the future. In a summary of the SARs for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 released on Thursday, NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion. The report says the cost growth is due primarily to increased investment in new launch systems providers to support national security space missions, and an increase of 19 launch services, from 160 to 179, based on satellite launch requirements.

The NSSL program was formerly known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. Congress renamed it in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act in recognition that there are now reusable, in addition to expendable, launch vehicles.

The EELV program dates back to 1994 when President Clinton signed a National Space Transportation Policy assigning responsibility for expendable launch vehicles to DoD. The NSSL program is transitioning to new launch vehicles and is seeking to leverage the commercial space industry.

The update to the Selected Acquisition Reports includes details on major defense acquisition program cost, schedule, and performance changes since December 2018. The new figures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 include projected spending in the president’s fiscal year 2020 budget submitted to Congress on March 11.

“SARs summarize the latest estimates of cost, schedule, and performance status,” DoD said in a news release. “These reports are prepared annually in conjunction with submission of the president’s budget.”

Quarterly exception reports are required only for those programs experiencing unit cost increases of at least 15 percent or schedule delays of at least six months. The total program acquisition cost estimates provided in the SARs include research and development, procurement, military construction, and acquisition-related operations and maintenance. These totals reflect actual costs to date as well as future anticipated costs. All estimates are shown in fully inflated then-year dollars.

The cost of the Pentagon’s entire weapons portfolio was $2 trillion in 2018, up from $1.9 trillion in 2017. Quantity changes account for the majority of the increase.

The NSSL program is one of four Air Force major acquisition programs that have reported cost increases greater than $1 billion or 10% since December 2018. The other three are the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization ($285.3 million, or 10.3%); the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ($5.2 billion); and the Joint Direct Attack Munition ($1.1 billion)."
More than half a million Americans exposed to toxic air pollution face cancer risks above EPA guidelines,https://phys.org,['Michael Hawthorne'],,,,https://phys.org/news/2019-08-million-americans-exposed-toxic-air.html,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

Neighbors used to barely notice the drab, low-slung industrial building across the river from downtown.

The corporate name on the sign out front had changed a few times over the years. Truck traffic in and out of the loading docks ebbed and flowed. As far as anybody knew, the only concern was word that spread around town years ago about a gas they used inside being explosive enough to level the entire building.

Even after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded last summer that the same gas is responsible for some of the nation's biggest cancer risks from toxic air pollution, it took months before residents of Michigan's second-largest city discovered they had an ethylene oxide problem.

EPA scientists had determined the lifetime cancer risk in one Grand Rapids census tract is nearly four times greater than the national average. But the Trump administration buried the finding in a report quietly released in August 2018.

Nobody at the EPA told people in the middle- and working-class neighborhood known as Kielbasa Valley that they were potentially at risk. Nor did the agency investigate the facility that had reported emitting the cancer-causing gas: a medical device manufacturer sandwiched between a cluster of two-story homes and a branch campus of Grand Valley State University.

""It's like we've been forgotten. Or maybe they just don't care,"" said Lorna Conkle, who grew up in the neighborhood and today lives a block away from the facility.

This pattern of inaction by the Trump EPA has been repeated in dozens of communities across the nation during the past year, a Chicago Tribune investigation found.

More than a half million Americans exposed to toxic air pollution face cancer risks exceeding agency guidelines, according to EPA data. Ethylene oxide is the chief chemical of concern.

Yet industrial facilities emitting the toxic gas continue to legally operate under federal regulations that haven't been updated to reflect the risk it poses. As a result, neighbors for the most part don't know they are breathing pollution that can potentially trigger breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas.

Some of the communities the EPA found to be at risk are near sprawling petrochemical complexes in Louisiana and Texas where ethylene oxide is produced by industry giants, including Dow Chemical, Shell, Huntsman and Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow).

Others facing elevated cancer risks live close to nondescript buildings owned by lesser-known companies that use the toxic gas to sterilize medical products in the suburbs of Atlanta and Denver; Charleston, S.C.; Laredo, Texas; and rural Missouri.

So far the only source of ethylene oxide scrutinized by the EPA is Sterigenics, a sterilization facility behind a Target store and next to the village hall in Willowbrook, a Chicago suburb where residents and elected officials mobilized to demand action after learning they were living in a pollution hot spot.

Faced with a public outcry and bipartisan political pressure, the EPA deployed air monitoring equipment last winter at parks, schools and homes near Sterigenics. Three months of testing confirmed that pollution from the facility could trigger more than 10 cases of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetimes—a rate 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

""We have been very proactive,"" Cathy Stepp, the Trump administration's top EPA official in the Midwest, told a public forum in May.

The testing in Willowbrook produced real-world measurements of ethylene oxide that led to the shutdown of Sterigenics. But Trump administration officials have refused to monitor air quality in other communities that stand out in the latest National Air Toxics Assessment, an occasional report compiled by EPA scientists intended to highlight areas of the United States where more investigation is needed.

EPA officials also haven't done anything to draw the public's attention to alarming cancer risks in those communities.

There are 73,057 census tracts in the U.S., with between 2,500 and 8,000 people living in each one. In 106 tracts, the EPA data shows, the risk of developing cancer from breathing toxic air pollution over a lifetime exceeds agency guidelines.

Three entire counties in Louisiana, known locally as parishes, face risks considered unacceptable by the EPA.

The population of a Louisiana tract with the nation's highest cancer risks is largely African American and poor—one of the definitions of an environmental justice community. However, in about two-thirds of the areas facing risks exceeding EPA guidelines, most of the residents are white and live in either middle-class or well-to-do neighborhoods, according to census data.

In the absence of action by the Trump administration, decisions about ethylene oxide pollution have been left to state environmental agencies. Only Colorado and Michigan reacted to the EPA findings by launching investigations.

""We took it very seriously, and we are very concerned,"" said Heidi Hollenbach, a district supervisor at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. ""Our No. 1 concern here is protecting public health.""

State officials already were involved in the Grand Rapids neighborhood when the EPA identified it as a pollution hot spot. In 2017, residents had raised concerns about a possible cancer cluster they feared might be linked to a city dump where the federal agency had overseen a cleanup during the late 1990s.

While health officials began studying actual cases of cancer in the area, Hollenbach's agency adopted more stringent limits on ethylene oxide, based on a 2016 scientific evaluation by the EPA that concluded the chemical is far more dangerous than previously thought.

Citing its new regulations, the state agency accused Viant Medical, the current owner of the medical device manufacturing facility, of violating Michigan air quality standards. Then state officials installed the same type of monitoring equipment the EPA used in Willowbrook to measure day-to-day concentrations of ethylene oxide in the surrounding neighborhood.

""They found it's hitting the people downtown, too, the people with money,"" said Margo Johnson, an employment benefits consultant and president of a local neighborhood group. ""That's when things really started to change.""

Sometimes environmental agencies fail to enforce clean air and water laws until confronted by residents affected by pollution. But in many of the communities with elevated cancer risks from toxic air, people don't know they are at risk.

For instance, there has been no federal or state scrutiny of B. Braun, a German manufacturer of medical and pharmaceutical products, despite EPA records showing the company's Allentown, Pa., assembly plant emitted more ethylene oxide than Sterigenics did in Willowbrook between 2014 and 2016.

What makes the EPA's decision to not conduct air quality testing even more remarkable: The agency's own scientists determined that 56,000 people near the Allentown facility face elevated cancer risks—more than twice the affected population in suburban Chicago neighborhoods surrounding Sterigenics.

B. Braun legally emits ethylene oxide, just as Sterigenics did for years in Willowbrook. But permits for both companies were based on regulations adopted before the EPA had concluded that the toxic gas can be harmful at extremely low levels.

""B. Braun Medical Inc. has a longstanding history of responsible operation of our facilities in a manner designed to fully protect our employees and the communities in which we operate,"" the company said in an email response to questions from the Tribune. ""B. Braun continues to investigate the availability of alternative methods that are consistent with our commitment to ensuring the safety of patients, clinicians, our employees and the environment.""

The EPA didn't require the sterilization industry to install pollution-control equipment until the late 1990s. Agency officials relaxed the regulations a few years later in response to explosions at plants in Indiana, Massachusetts, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Industry representatives persuaded regulators that the government-mandated pollution controls were responsible for the blasts, though investigators found operator errors were to blame in each case and could have been prevented with more rigorous training and safer handling of the highly flammable chemical.

For most of 2019, it appeared the EPA's conclusions about ethylene oxide might prompt the Trump administration to briefly detour from its aggressive campaign to scrap environmental regulations.

William Wehrum, the administration official in charge of the EPA's air quality office, promised the agency would adopt more stringent federal restrictions on pollution from the sterilization industry. As recently as late May, Wehrum told the Tribune the rules would be based on a stringent safety limit derived from the agency's 2016 evaluation of the chemical.

""We are now in a position to make very good decisions about what needs to happen next,"" he told a May 29 public forum in Burr Ridge, a Chicago suburb next door to Willowbrook. ""We're going to get results.""

But after Wehrum resigned in June, the EPA indefinitely delayed releasing the ethylene oxide rules for public comment.

Members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, including EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, are under pressure from the White House to eliminate regulations, not to adopt new ones. The chemical and sterilization industries also are lobbying the administration to back off, in part by raising doubts about the cancer risks posed by ethylene oxide.

Trade groups have petitioned the administration to throw out the EPA's scientific evaluation, sought to weaken the agency's safety limit through unrelated rule-making and hired industry-friendly scientists whose research was rejected by two panels of independent scientists convened by the EPA.

If administration officials end up agreeing with industry lobbyists, the federal government would not require companies that make and use ethylene oxide to do anything to reduce their pollution. The cancer risks calculated by the EPA would suddenly disappear in Allentown, Willowbrook and other hot spots.

""People are going to continue to suffer, though,"" said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council who helped draft a recent letter to the EPA that rebutted claims made by the chemical industry.

The chemical industry has fought tougher ethylene oxide regulations for decades, Sass noted. ""Now a bunch of corporations are having a temper tantrum,"" she said, ""because they don't like what the science is telling us about this extremely dangerous chemical.""

In Illinois, it doesn't matter what the federal government decides about ethylene oxide.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration shut down the company's Willowbrook facility in February. Before the company can be permitted to resume operations, a new state law and a recently negotiated legal settlement require an overhaul that would limit emissions to 85 pounds a year, down from 2,890 pounds released into the community during 2017.

Sterigenics said it already has taken steps to reduce emissions from its facilities in Smyrna, Ga., and Santa Teresa, N.M., two other communities where the EPA determined that neighbors face elevated cancer risks. The company also said it is planning to upgrade all nine of its U.S. facilities with technology similar to what it is planning for Willowbrook.

""We will ensure that our additional controls will comply with any changing regulations,"" the company said in an email response to questions from the Tribune, ""and we will seek to continue to perform far better than those requirements at all of our facilities.""

The Illinois law requires similar improvements at Medline Industries in Waukegan, where local officials scrambled to finance air quality testing after federal and state agencies brushed aside pleas from neighbors.

Back in Grand Rapids, Lorna Conkle and her husband, Larry, said they didn't think twice when a state official knocked on their door earlier this year and asked if inspectors could measure ethylene oxide concentrations in their backyard.

The stainless steel canisters used to collect samples, outfitted with gauges and tubes that make them look like something out of a 1950s science fiction movie, were posted near the Tiki bar that Larry Conkle built from scratch and the wooden fence the couple painted with images of ocean waves.

During a recent visit, the space where the Conkles usually erect an above-ground pool for their grandchildren was empty. They decided to keep the pool in storage after the state's testing found that concentrations of ethylene oxide in their yard were 800 times higher than Michigan's safety limit.

""I feel uncomfortable about the kids coming over,"" Lorna Conkle said. ""I feel guilty that they've been exposed to this for all of these years.""

In March, hours before state officials convened a public meeting about Viant's emissions, the company dropped a letter in mailboxes throughout the neighborhood. Viant claimed the ethylene oxide could be coming from vehicle exhaust, but the big news was in bold face just below the company logo:

By the end of the year, the letter said, the company will stop using the toxic gas in Grand Rapids for good.

""That's great, but if this stuff is so bad why didn't they shut it down immediately?"" Larry Conkle said.

""They say exposure is only dangerous over a lifetime,"" he said. ""But when you live here, when you've got grandkids here, you're not thinking about a lifetime. You want to be safe now.""

Growing up on a farm in rural Kentucky, Gene Bell learned the value — and the price — of hard physical labor.

""A lot of hogs, a lot of burley (tobacco),” Bell said, adding that tobacco in particular was labor intensive. “When I started it, you had to top it and sucker it, and then you had to cut it and put it in the barn. Then strip it, press it and take it the warehouse. There’s a whole art to it.”

To prevent nicotine poisoning, he had to wear a hat, a long-sleeved shirt and safety glasses, all in Kentucky's oppressive summer heat.

But an incident beyond tobacco harvesting really convinced Bell he needed to find a way out of the fields, most likely through higher education.

Like a lot of older men in those days, Bell's grandfather often wore a truss, a type of padded belt, to hold in hernias. One day when he was out digging post holes, the truss failed and his grandfather’s intestines poured through the hernias. Other men had to work furiously to tuck them back into his abdomen.

Bell threw up.

“I thought, ‘You don’t have to worry about me not going to college, bro,"" he said with a laugh.

Now, six decades later, Bell has retired after a 25-year career with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, including the past 14 as CEO. He spent 20 years before that in the business world.

Bell will continue working part-time with the authority, strictly to see through a project he views as his baby: the transformation of the 96-unit Lee Walker Heights public housing development into a 212-unit mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood.

CLOSE After 25 years with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, CEO Gene Bell is retiring. Angeli Wright, awright@citizen-times.com

Bell was honored July 25 with a farewell gathering at the Arthur R. Edington Education & Career Center, a program attended by about 130 friends, family members and coworkers. Asheville Vice Mayor Gwen Wisler read a proclamation declaring the date ""Gene Bell Day,"" and Buncombe County Commissioner Amanda Edwards noted the county plans to offer a similar proclamation at the Aug. 6 Board of Commissioners meeting.

A steady stream of speakers talked about how much Bell, who has served on dozens of boards and committees, has meant to the city, public housing and to them personally. They also described him as a sometimes strict father figure who stressed accountability, a man obsessed with punctuality and efficiency who each day carried a handwritten to-do list in his pocket.

But he also has been a leader always willing to give someone a second chance or a hand up, several people said.

All about relationships

The Rev. Jim Abbott, former pastor of St. Matthias Episcopal Church and a longtime friend, said Bell simply committed himself to the community early on, and he had a knack for connecting the dots between education, poverty and jobs. Bell carved out time for community service, whether it was serving on the Asheville City Schools board or on the board of Muddy Sneakers, a program designed to get kids outdoors.

""I don't think many great things went on in this community over the last 25 years that don't have your fingerprints on them,"" Abbott said.

Shaunda Sandford, coordinator of the Housing Authority's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, talked about Bell's love of the outdoors. He took her hiking for the first time, showing her that ""black people can go hiking and enjoy it,"" she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Bell repeatedly said his job, as well as life, really comes down to one simple theme: respecting and caring about people.

(Photo: ANGELI WRIGHT/ASHEVILLE CITIZEN TIMES)

“I believe the most important thing in this world is relationships,” Bell said at his retirement event. ""Now, people have a lot of philosophical definitions of that, but the true meaning for your existence is relationships. You’ve got to help people. If we helped people as much as we deter people, it would be a lot easier.”

Bell said he's particularly proud of his work with the Residents Councils in the various housing developments.

Crystal Reid, president of the Residents Council for Lee Walker Heights and Klondyke Homes, said before the event that those relationships have been mutually beneficial. She lives in Klondyke and previously lived in Lee Walker.

""He’s a very neutral man and he keeps things transparent, and that’s one quality I greatly appreciate in him,"" Reid said. ""He's a very balanced man. He's not one to go toward the negative or the positive. He keeps it in the middle so everyone has a chance to say their piece.""

Relationships have always been precious to Bell, as well as tenuous at times.

Bell’s mother died when he was 11, in hindsight a harbinger of the loss of many of the people closest to Bell. He lost his first wife, Sharon, in 2015; and his daughter, Angela, who died from an aneurysm at age 40 in 2013. Bell also has a son, Shannon, 44, who is partially disabled after suffering a stroke.

While he's a little gruff on the exterior and known for his sometimes colorful language, Bell is also known for his optimism and genuinely caring about others.

At the Edington Center, Bell directly addressed the losses.

""Since I started with the housing authority — I think I can get through this — I’ve lost my daughter, my wife, my father, mother-in-law, six aunts, two uncles, eight first cousins, two mentors,” Bell said. “The reason that I can continue to go on is because when I look out here, it’s about you all. I can’t do anything about my losses, but I can damn sure do something about the people who are living.”

David Nash, who replaces Bell as CEO at HACA, said Bell was well-known for storytelling, regaling people with tales of life on the farm or his grandfather's frugality. Sometimes Bell would talk about his early career as one of the first African American managers at IBM.

""At some point I realized he wasn’t just doing this with staff, that he was doing it with the whole community — and by the whole community, I mean the African American community, the white community, the broader community of Asheville,"" Nash said. ""He didn’t care whether your name was Smith or Cecil, or whether it was Wanda or Shevonda. He could make a connection with people, he can make a connection with people. And he can really make people feel warm and welcome.""

Allison Smith, the property manager for HACA's Pisgah View Apartments, said Bell has always been ""firm and fair,"" balancing safety with livability.

""I think he's just a father figure for anyone who's walked the halls at (the Housing Authority),"" Smith said. ""He was there for everybody.""

Jovan Aiken, a maintenance technician with the Authority for about a year, said Bell helped a lot of people with jobs and ""never left anybody hanging or out to dry.""

Despite the early loss of his mother, Bell said he felt blessed to have grown up with both grandfathers within a mile. “I had a lot of love — as much as I could stand,"" he said. ""I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world.”

A business career came first

Bell graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a degree in business management, then spent 20 years working for IBM, the international computer and management giant. He had upper level management stints in Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati;Cleveland, then at IBM headquarters in New Jersey.

Eventually, ""they asked me to move to Charlotte, and at that time it was all about money,” Bell said, noting he was the human relations manager at the time.

“I stayed two years and decided to do something different,” Bell said, adding that he was going to have to relocate once again, and he had a daughter in high school. “So I resigned and bought a construction company. I grew up doing construction work.”

In 1989, bad luck struck much of the Carolinas in the form of Hurricane Hugo, which left a trail of destruction far inland, including extensive damage to homes and other buildings in and around Charlotte.

“After Hugo, we had more business than we could take,” Bell said. “People remember when you treat them right.”

Bell had started coming to Asheville in the early 1970s and was a frequent visitor throughout the ‘70s and 80s with his first wife. In 1994, they moved to Asheville, after Bell met former HACA Director David Jones at an insurance conference. Bell had been working for the Charlotte Housing Authority for two years.

At Bell's retirement party, Jones recounted how heavily he recruited Bell.

""Boy, did I check him out,"" Jones said. ""The harder I checked, the better he looked. Not only was he a good manager and a good person, he reached out into the neighborhoods.""

Looking 'to chill a little bit'

Bell joined Asheville's Housing Authority as director of maintenance and building, but he had no intention of taking the top job.

“I came here to kind of chill a little bit,” Bell said. “I wanted to remodel the house and ride my motorcycle.”

When a boating accident claimed the life of Michael Godwin, who was expected to replaced Jones as CEO, Bell's name rose to the top as the next natural next leader. From childhood, Bell has had a strong sense of service built into his life, and he knew he could do that job — and that he should.

Bell and Jones, having done the same job for so long, truly appreciate each other's service. Bell says Jones was a fine mentor and kept his distance after leaving.

“When Dave left, I think he came to the office one time in a year, maybe two times in a year,” Bell said. “I will do the same thing. If you were ever going to follow in someone’s footsteps, he was the one. He was a gentleman and a scholar.”

Despite the demands of the job, Bell has also felt a calling to serve the community in other ways. Over the years, he has served on the Asheville City Schools board, chaired the Housing Coalition, and he now chairs the Buncombe County Planning Board. He's been on the city’s Civil Service Board, as well as holding several posts with public housing entities in the state and region.

He’s chaired the board of the Young Men’s Institute, and been involved with Buncombe County’s Capital Fund Commission, Read to Succeed and the Isaac Coleman Grant Committee. As a school board member, Bell pushed hard for the new Isaac Dickson Elementary School and Asheville Middle School.

Successes and some lingering problems, including crime

Bell is not one to tout his own accomplishments, but he is “really proud” that the housing authority went to HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration system in which all residents get a housing voucher. That’s allowed a lot of residents to live in other places than public housing units, and it gives them the freedom to move.

The program can pay up to 35 percent of their gross adjusted income. The Housing Authority now has about 3,000 vouchers and about 5,000 residents.

More: New Asheville policy could help some of its poorest residents buy homes

Bell also noted all of the HACA units — Pisgah View, Deaverview, Hillcrest, Klondyke and the Livingston Street apartments, as well as Lee Walker Heights — have been renovated or upgraded during his tenure.

Yet he'll quickly list the “great relationship with resident councils” among his top successes

He also considers surveillance cameras installation in developments to be a major help in curtailing crime, although some residents bristled at what they considered a loss of privacy. “It was tough in the beginning,” Bell allowed.

Bell said is proud the authority's ""banned"" list, typically reserved for residents who've committed serious crimes or threatened physical violence, is the smallest it's been during his tenure.

Crime remains a problem in the city's poorest neighborhoods, which include public housing developments. At a presentation to City Council in late June, Asheville Police Department Deputy Chief Jim Baumstark said gun violence — homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults — has risen 55% in three years.

Baumstark said two public housing complexes in West Asheville and one near downtown account for ""more than half of all calls for gunshot wounds, gun discharges and persons with guns."" Five of the top 10 locations from which calls originated were in and around public housing communities, police said.

Bell acknowledges crime remains a problem, but he also touches on one of his mantras, an opinion shared by other African American leaders in the city: “The problem we’ve experienced is the perpetrators of our crime are (usually) not residents of (public) housing.”

Carl Mumpower, a former Asheville City Councilman who often volunteered in public housing and worked closely with Bell, says Bell ""has carried one of the toughest leadership roles in our community with maturity, balance and courage.""

A conservative who has run for Congress and chaired Buncombe County's Republican Party, Mumpower has been critical of public housing at times, particularly the scourge of drug dealing.

""The drug and criminal culture continues to thrive in public housing,"" Mumpower said. ""That said, it was always my sense that Mr. Bell tried to find solutions and was open to any help he could get. Most of the time there wasn’t much, and that’s not a fight you can win alone.""

Looking for speed, and flat running spots

While he'll stay busy with the Lee Walker project, a $36.5 million transformation, Bell will have a much reduced work schedule. That'll leave time for his other loves, including his family, running and fast vehicles.

An avid runner, Bell has logged scores of races over the years, including a few marathons and 10K’s. Time has taken a toll, though.

“I do maybe 1-3 miles now,” Bell said. “I’m always looking for flat places to run.”

Bell and his wife, Patricia, live in a nice brick rancher in between the Livingston Heights public housing apartments and Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, a home Bell overhauled upon moving in. He’s always gotten a chuckle out of people who suggest he’s out of touch with public housing residents.

“I tell them, ‘I live a block away from public housing,’” Bell said.

While he’s not an extravagant man when it comes to clothes or perks, Bell does have one indulgence: fast vehicles. An avid motorcyclist, his pride and joy is a 790-pound 2013 Harley-Davidson Street Glide dripping with chrome.

When it comes to four wheels, it’s a 2013 Mercedes Benz AMG coupe with an enormous V8 motor and a growl like a Rottweiller on high alert. Bell bought it used, but he knows it still looks like an extravagance.

“You can’t make it logical,” he said.

The Bells have known each other for 27 years, but they just married last December.

Patricia Bell said she’s always been impressed by her husband’s ability to find the good in life.

“He never concentrates on the negatives in life,” she said while sitting in their living room. “It’s all about the good things.”

“And the people that are left,” Bell quickly adds.

At his daughter’s memorial service, Patricia Bell was moved by how Gene Bell concentrated on “nothing but the good times” they had together.

She’s less sanguine about his penchant for speed in the Mercedes.

“The first time I got in there and he stomped the gas, I thought, ‘You’re not 17 or 18 years old,’” Patricia said with a laugh.

Bell said they just completed a 2,450-mile trip up north, so he's pretty sure they're compatible.

He's equally sure he's done right by his community and coworkers over his long career.

""What I've wanted to do is what I've been able to do, and that is to help,"" Bell said.

"Brixmor and former executives charged with accounting fraud by SEC, Justice Department",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Francine Mckenna'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brixmor-and-former-executives-charged-with-accounting-fraud-by-sec-justice-department-2019-08-01,"The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department filed charges on Thursday against four former top executives of Brixmor Property Group, accusing them of fraudulently manipulating an earnings metric to achieve Brixmor’s publicly-issued growth targets.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York filed criminal charges against former Brixmor Chief Executive Michael Carroll, CFO Michael Pappagallo, Chief Accounting Officer Steven Splain and Senior Vice President Michael Mortimer on Thursday. Splain and Mortimer have already pleaded guilty to the criminal charges and have agreed to the entry of partial judgments against them related to the SEC’s charges. The SEC’s settlements are subject to court approval.

Brixmor BRX, -2.45% is a publicly traded real-estate investment trust and one of the largest owners of open-air shopping centers. The SEC‘s complaint says that in every quarter except one from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015, Brixmor and the four executives manipulated the value of a key non-GAAP measure — “Same Property Net Operating Income Growth Rate,” or SP NOI — to give the impression of steady, predictable growth that met analyst expectations.

The true SP NOI number was quite volatile and, at times, varied dramatically from the company’s announced guidance, according to the charges. The SEC alleges that the defendants described their manipulation of the non-GAAP measure as “mak[ing] the sausage.” To enhance the impression of positive performance, they also improperly lowered the prior year’s SP NOI to give the appearance of stronger growth in the current year, the feds allege.

Gregory Kehoe of Greenberg Traurig LLP, attorney for Michael Pappagallo, told MarketWatch, “We will contest the civil and criminal charges.”

“Mike Carroll has always acted with integrity and honesty, including during his time at Brixmor. He looks forward to vigorously defending himself against these charges, which we believe to be unfounded,” emailed Anjan Sahni, an attorney for Michael Carroll from Wilmer Hale.

Jerry Bernstein of Blank Rome, the attorney for Michael Mortimer, declined comment. The attorney for Splain did not respond to a request for comment.

Brixmor disclosed on February 8, 2016 that, based on an Audit Committee investigation of a whistleblower’s complaint, Brixmor’s board had concluded that certain accounting and financial reporting personnel had “smoothed” income items, both up and down, between quarters in an effort to show consistent quarterly Same Property NOI growth during the relevant period. The company announced the resignations of the CEO, CFO, CAO, and Accounting SVP at that time and provided revised SP NOI Growth Rates for each of the quarters of the relevant period.

MarketWatch reported on Feb 11, 2016, that Brixmor used a non-GAAP metric that triggered incentive bonuses called “cash NOI” that starts with total property revenues and then also subtracts straight-line rent, above- and below-market rent amortization, and Brixmor’s share of cash net operating income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

Read: Executive bonuses at issue in Brixmor’s admission of altered results

Carroll, Pappagallo and Splain were each awarded bonuses in 2014 for exactly meeting the targeted $2.79 per share on the NOI measure. That non-GAAP metric was one of three quantitative metrics used to determine bonuses for the executives. Carroll received a bonus of $800,000, Pappagallo received $750,000, and Splain got $210,000.

The SEC’s investigation, assisted by the U.S. Attorney, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the New York State Department of Financial Services, described the whistleblower’s reports that said he believed the “core piece of this earnings management” was conducted through a particular internal ledger account—the 2617 account—which was used as a “cookie jar” to hold funds to be “taken into income somewhere down the line to help the company meet earnings guidance.”

The SEC’s complaint says that Carroll, Pappagallo, Splain and Mortimer improperly adjusted Brixmor’s SP NOI by selectively recognizing income from a “cookie jar” account which, for example, held deferred revenue that was recognized as GAAP income at the executive’s discretion rather than based on accounting rules. These adjustments to GAAP numbers were purposely made in amounts that fell below the auditor’s materiality threshold for review, according to the SEC’s complaint.

In other cases the executives made adjustments to the components of the SP NOI metric, such as excluding a property from the “same property” pool when its poor performance was pushing the metric down.

“We allege that these senior executives intentionally manipulated a key metric to mislead investors about Brixmor’s ability to hit its targets,” said Marc P. Berger, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office in the SEC’s press release. “A company that chooses to publicly present non-GAAP financial measures must do so truthfully.”

Brixmor, the company, settled the SEC’s charges of violating the antifraud provision of the federal securities laws and a provision of Regulation G, which governs the use of non-GAAP metrics, without admitting or denying the allegations.

The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"
"Veterans can receive VA services at MedExpress, urgent care facilities",https://triblive.com,['Megan Tomasic'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/local/regional/veterans-can-receive-va-services-at-medexpress-urgent-care-facilities/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Urgent care services are now offered to veterans through Veteran Affairs urgent care clinics.

The program, which started June 6, offers services to those suffering from the flu, minor burns or skin infections at locations like MedExpress, UPMC Urgent Care and MinuteClinic, located inside CVS stores.

Retail locations include a walk-in health clinic within a retail business. These locations can help treat uncomplicated illnesses like a sore throat or earache. At urgent locations, officials can diagnose or treat illnesses or injury for people seeking immediate medical attention for non life-threatening illnesses or injuries.

“The new urgent care benefit is not a substitute for emergency care for life-threatening conditions,” Dr. Ali Sonel, VA Pittsburgh chief of staff, said in a news release. “Veterans experiencing a medical emergency should call 911 or visit their nearest emergency department.”

In order to receive the benefits, veterans must have received health care services from the VA in the last 24 months. Veterans may be required to pay a $30 copay. Those wanting to stay with VA providers can call 412-822-2222 for in-person or video appointments.

Beyond Pesticides Daily News Blog » Blog Archive Remind USDA that Genetic Engineering Is NOT Acceptable in Organic,https://beyondpesticides.org,"['Cindy Koch', 'Kathy Mcdonald', 'Susan Sorkenn']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2019/08/remind-usda-that-genetic-engineering-is-not-acceptable-in-organic/,"(Beyond Pesticides, August 5, 2019) The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) appears to have forgotten the lesson learned 20 years ago when it was forced to ban genetic engineering (GE) in organic regulations. At a July 17 hearing called by the U.S. House Agriculture Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research on “Assessing the Effectiveness of the National Organic Program,” Greg Ibach, the USDA’s Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, stated, “There is the opportunity to open the discussion to consider whether it is appropriate for some of these new technologies, including gene editing, to be eligible to be used to enhance organic production.”

In 1997, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published a draft rule that would have allowed GE, irradiation, and sewage sludge (the “Big Three”) in organic production, which was met by the second largest number of comments the agency had ever received—well before the days of internet advocacy—overwhelmingly opposing the inclusion of the “Big Three.” The prohibition of gene editing falls under the “excluded methods” provision of the organic regulations. The law prohibits “a variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes, and are not considered compatible with organic production.” (7 CFR 205.2) These prohibited methods include cell fusion, micro- and macro-encapsulation and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).

Ask Members of Congress to Remind USDA that Genetic Engineering Is NOT Acceptable in Organic!

There are many problems with GE, and consumers trust the organic label to provide food free of GE. USDA has long promoted GE, but has avoided pushing it in organic since the run-in with organic producers and consumers over the Big Three. Former Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, for example, promoted a policy of “coexistence” between GE and organic producers. In this regard, organic producers are joined by others who choose not to grow GE crops because they limit export sales.

Unfortunately, even USDA’s “coexistence” policy threatens the genetic and chemical integrity of organic food. In practice, “coexistence” means that those who develop and use GE technology are not held accountable for the damage they cause. The damage includes that arising from both genetic drift—which can make organic crops unsaleable in the organic marketplace—and chemical drift arising from the increased use of chemicals in GE-chemical intensive cropping systems. Any standard of acceptable use of technology would require control over the consequences. If the technology cannot be controlled, it should not be used.

Organic systems are modeled on natural ecosystems. GE organisms belong in neither:

GE is based on an out-of-date theory of “one gene—one effect” and ignores pleiotropy. Thus, a gene that makes a plant tolerant of glyphosate is assumed not to have other effects that might be important ecologically or nutritionally. Even the effect of herbicide tolerance itself may result in the presence of toxic metabolites of the herbicide in food.

Traditional breeding, like evolution itself, depends on forces acting on the whole organism. Exposure over time to different environments exposes unexpected traits. GE plants are created by manipulation of DNA that may create unanticipated results—results that may not be apparent until, for example, the plant is grown under unforeseen conditions.

Risks associated with GE crops cannot be predicted.

While the GE/chemical industry has created many claims to virtue for GE crops, the net effect of GE-based agriculture has been an expansion in the use of pesticides and subsequent resistance to pesticides—in other words, the pesticide treadmill.

Nearly half of all consumers in the U.S. say they avoid buying GE foods, and the growth of the organic sector—now more than $50 billion per year in sales—offers those consumers the choice they want.

Ask Members of Congress to Remind USDA that Genetic Engineering Is NOT Acceptable in Organic!

Letter to Congress

On July 17, Greg Ibach, the USDA’s Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, stated, “There is the opportunity to open the discussion to consider whether it is appropriate for some of these new technologies, including gene editing, to be eligible to be used to enhance organic production.” I am writing to ask that you let Under Secretary Greg Ibach know his statement is unacceptable and challenges a foundation of organic principles and values.

Evidently, Mr. Ibach has forgotten the reaction 20 years ago, when the USDA published a draft organic rule that would have allowed genetic engineering (GE), irradiation, and sewage sludge (the “Big Three”) in organic production. The suggestion was met by the largest number of comments the agency had ever received, overwhelmingly opposing the inclusion of the “Big Three.”

That is why the final organic regulations include a provision prohibiting “excluded methods,” which are “a variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes, and are not considered compatible with organic production.” (7 CFR 205.2)

There are many problems with GE, and consumers know that they can trust the organic label to provide food free of GE. USDA has long promoted GE, but since the run-in with organic producers and consumers over the Big Three, avoided pushing GE in organic. Former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, for example, promoted a policy of “coexistence” between GE and organic producers.

State Department wasted $100M on Afghan camp despite early warnings: Report,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-department-wasted-100m-afghan-camp-early-warnings/story?id=64683930,"The U.S. State Department spent over three years and more than $100 million on a project to rebuild a base in Afghanistan that was never rebuilt, even though the department was warned it was a bad idea from the start, according to an incisive new government watchdog report.

Interested in Afghanistan? Add Afghanistan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Afghanistan news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The report, published online by the State Department's inspector general Tuesday, rapped the department for rushing through a plan in 2014 to reconstruct the government's Camp Eggars in Kabul, Afghanistan, using a defense contracting company that had never taken on such a construction project. The department had hired a consultant to review the project but then dismissed the consultant’s early warnings about issues it foresaw early on.

""As a result, there were a series of cascading problems,"" the report says. “This led to the expenditures of $103.2 million without any discernible benefit to the Department or to the people it intended to protect.”

OIG

The inspector general concedes that the State Department was trying to work as quickly as possible with few options in the midst of a deteriorating security situation, but says the department was in such a rush that it failed to keep the project on track and failed to hold the primary contractor, Aegis Defense Services, accountable. The inspector general undertook the review of the project after the State Department's deputy secretary requested it do so last year. A spokesperson for GardaWorld Federal Services, which does some U.S. government business as Aegis since its parent company bought Aegis in 2015, did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

The original plan, hatched in the summer of 2014, was to rebuild Camp Eggars in order to house security personnel much closer to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Kabul had become more dangerous after the U.S. drawdown in 2014, and officials feared the security personnel, then based two miles away, lived too far from the people they were meant to protect.

But the State Department office that usually handles large construction projects was unable to take on the job, so the department instead modified a government contract meant primarily for security services to include the reconstruction. So Aegis, which previously focused on providing protection for American personnel, attempted to take on the reconstruction itself with the help of construction-focused subcontractors.

That meant that a State Department office unfamiliar with the demands of large construction projects was working with a company with little experience of its own in that area, the report says.

Problems began “almost immediately,” and, coupled with changes the State Department wanted to make as the project progressed, eventually the estimated overall price tag grew to more than $300 million, the report says. In an example of the waste, the report said millions were spent on construction materials, but delays in the project meant they had to be stored elsewhere for long periods of time at additional cost – more than $22 million in all.

The State Department finally gave up in December 2016, with an estimated 10 percent of the construction actually completed.

The inspector general made three recommendations to the State Department to improve its policies related to such warzone construction projects, but the State Department disagreed with two of them, maintaining that the Camp Eggars project presented “very unique circumstances.” The department said it would review the Camp Eggars project, however, to determine “whether the decision to expend the amount cited was necessary or reasonable.”"
Ryan Zinke email use now part of Justice Department investigation,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/zinke-email-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's use of private email to conduct official business is now part of a Department of Justice criminal probe, a government watchdog said Tuesday.

The Interior Department inspector general wrote to members of Congress that it is now working with federal prosecutors.

""In consultation with DOJ and to avoid any interference with the criminal case, we have decided to combine the investigations,"" read the letter from acting inspector general Gail Ennis.

It said the Justice Department probe began ""last year,"" around the time when two senior Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Raul Grijalva and Elijah Cummings, requested information from the inspector general on ""many instances in which Secretary Zinke sent and received emails containing official business using his personal email account.""

In October, CNN reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Zinke used his position for private gain.

Multiple agencies coordinate with EPA for Mass City mercury spill cleanup,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com,[],,,,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/content/news/Multiple-agencies-coordinate-with-EPA-for-Mass-City-mercury-spill-cleanup-513941201.html,"Representatives from Ontonagon County Emergency Management and the Western Upper Peninsula Health Department are working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency following an accidental mercury spill at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Mass City.

The spill was small, has been contained and is not a threat to the surrounding neighborhood.

The incident was first reported via law enforcement on July 28 and quickly worked its way through the emergency response system resulting in the arrival of the Health Department, EPA and hazardous materials cleanup crews shortly thereafter.

Following mitigation efforts, the effects of the spill have been minimized and both physical contamination of the property, a nearby home and adjacent vacant lot as well as air quality are being monitored by specialized equipment.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” said Mike Kocher, Emergency Services Director for Ontonagon County. “Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

According to reports, the initial incident occurred when children entered the abandoned repair facility garage and discovered mercury in a small bottle. Their home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

Mercury is an element that has been used in thermometers, electric switches, lights, batteries and even in paper processing. Both the EPA and Western U.P. Health Department have published guidelines concerning what to do if involved in a larger spill. These include never using a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean up, never pouring it down a drain and never walking through it which can contaminate shoes and track it elsewhere.

""Mercury has interesting properties making it attractive to kids"" said Pete Baril, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator for the Western UP Health Department. ""As interesting and harmless as it may appear, mercury gives off toxic vapors that can be damaging to one’s health, especially children. We cannot stress enough the importance of getting rid of mercury sources in your home. If you have mercury in your home secure it and call your local health department for advice. We would much prefer to work with you on safely getting it out of your home than on a spill situation that can become very complicated very quickly.""

It was reported this week that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential criminal charges over his handling of work-related documents, some of which held confidential information. But sources at the DOJ told Fox News that the case ""could not be prosecuted"" and that it ""wasn't a close call.""

DOJ WILL NOT PROSECUTE COMEY FOR LEAKING MEMOS AFTER IG REFERRAL: SOURCES

Appearing on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Nunes suggested that Comey isn't out of the woods just yet, though.

""Just because the DOJ is not going to act under that recommendation does not mean that he's not going to be further looked at,"" Nunes said. ""Remember, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut [John Durham] now is taking all of this information in, so he's taking our criminal referrals, for example...

"U.S. Department of Labor cites Lebanon, Mo. barrel maker for hazardous conditions",https://www.ky3.com,[],,,,https://www.ky3.com/content/news/US-Department-of-Labor-cites-Lebanon-Mo-barrel-maker-for-hazardous-conditions-514189301.html,"The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Missouri Cooperage Company LLC ‒ a subsidiary of Independent Stave Company‒ for exposing employees to amputation, noise, and other safety and health hazards at the spirits and wine barrel-making facility in Lebanon, Mo.

The company faces $413,370 in federal penalties.

OSHA initiated an inspection in February 2019 after Missouri Cooperage Company LLC reported that an employee suffered a finger amputation when her hand was caught between the belt and pulley system. This was the fifth amputation injury the company reported in a 14-month period. Inspectors cited the company for operating an unguarded chain and sprocket – the same violation for which OSHA cited the company in February 2018.

OSHA also cited the company for exposing employees to electrical and occupational noise hazards, failing to guard machines and implement adequate lockout/tagout procedures, and creating a potential fire hazard by allowing dust to accumulate on floors and surfaces.

“Employers must follow the legal requirements put in place to protect workers from injuries. Anything less than that is unacceptable,” said OSHA Regional Administrator Kimberly Stille in Kansas City, Missouri. “Employers must continually evaluate their facilities for hazards, and train employees and managers to use proper safety controls and equipment to keep their worksites safe and healthful.”

OSHA offers compliance assistance resources on occupational noise exposure, machine guarding, control of hazardous energy, respiratory protection, exposure to combustible dust and electrical safety work practices.

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA’s area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA’s role is to help ensure these conditions for America’s working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education, and assistance.
