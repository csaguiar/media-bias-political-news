"Trump’s Trade War Escalation Will Exact Economic Pain, Adviser Says",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jeanna Smialek', 'Jim Tankersley', 'Mark Landler']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/politics/trump-us-china-economy.html,"Mr. Trump and his advisers insist his approach will ultimately pay off for the American economy — either by prodding China to open its markets and treat American firms more fairly, or by encouraging companies to shift manufacturing to the United States to avoid tariffs.

But the decision to prolong the trade war could upend economic projections that showed robust hiring, growth and investment this year, in part because of fading concerns about a protracted trade fight. And it could defy steady predictions by administration economists that Mr. Trump’s trade policy will help increase growth in 2019 to 3.2 percent — well above what most other forecasters expect.

“There is absolutely no question that these tariffs, if imposed and sustained, increase the probability of a recession,” Rob Martin, a former Fed section chief who is now an executive director at UBS, said of a potential escalation. “It makes you more vulnerable.”

Mr. Martin and his colleagues estimate that Mr. Trump’s latest increase could shave 0.25 to 0.35 percentage points off gross domestic product over six months. If the remainder of China’s products get hit with a 25 percent tariff, it could shave up to another full percentage point from G.D.P.

“If we move into that next tranche of tariffs, we’re in 100 percent uncharted territory,” Mr. Martin said. The products in that category are about two-thirds consumer goods and for many — which could include toys, bicycles and iPhones — it could be hard to find quick substitutes.

A prolonged trade war could inflict damage on China’s economy. Economic growth in China slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.

Officials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter."
Trump blasts Dems' declaration of constitutional crisis as 'pathetically untrue',https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dems-constitutional-crisis-pathetically-untrue,"President Trump blasted the declaration from many Democrats that the United States has been facing a “constitutional crisis” in a series of tweets on Sunday, calling it “pathetically untrue.”

Trump tweeted, “The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a 'Constitutional Crisis.' They and their partner, the Fake News Media, are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. They are a sad JOKE! We may have the strongest Economy in our history, best employment numbers ever, low taxes & regulations, a rebuilt military & V.A., many great new judges, & so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation, a Witch Hunt, a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis & hopefully guilty people will pay!”

The tweet came four days after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., declared a ""constitutional crisis"" after his committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted Russia report and underlying documents.

The next day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she agreed with Nadler’s statement that the U.S. was facing a “constitutional crisis.”

NADLER DECLARES 'CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS' AFTER CONTEMPT VOTE, ACCUSES TRUMP OF ATTACKING 'ESSENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY'

“This administration wants to have a constitutional crisis because they do not respect the oath of office that they take,” Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference Thursday on Capitol Hill.

Nadler's committee voted along partisan lines to hold Barr in contempt on Wednesday and angered the White House by not delaying the vote. At the same time, the president invoked executive privilege — refusing to comply with Congressional subpoenas.

Nadler accused the White House of ""stonewalling"" the American people and attacking ""the essence of our democracy.""

Barr was set to testify before the House panel earlier this month, following his remarks before the Senate, but pulled out after Democrats insisted committee staff, rather than members of Congress, be allowed to ask the questions.

Trump also tweeted on Sunday, “Despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax, the biggest in American history!”

Mueller’s redacted Russia report was released into Washington’s partisan scrum last month showing investigators did not find proof of collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia – as Attorney General Bill Barr declared– but revealing an array of controversial actions by the president that were examined as part of the investigation’s obstruction inquiry.

Even though Barr's DOJ determined it did not have sufficient evidence to pursue such a case, the details in the report fueled Democrats' mounting calls not only to see the unredacted report but also to have Mueller testify.

“The ‘Constitutional Crisis’ is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border,” Trump also tweeted on Sunday.

President Trump also addressed the newly imposed tariff hikes targeting China, saying the country loved “ripping off America.”

And, in a shot at both China and Democrats running for the White House in 2020, Trump tweeted, “China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden, or any of the others, gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!”

US TO SLAP TARIFFS ON $200B IN CHINESE GOODS, WH SAYS, BUT TRADE TALKS TO RESUME FRIDAY

The United States began raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent on Friday after U.S. officials accused Beijing of backtracking on commitments made in earlier rounds of negotiations.

In an earlier tweet Sunday, Trump wrote, “We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-Tariffed countries. We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture), which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA”

Talks in Washington broke off on Friday between the U.S. and China without a deal on trade, but both sides have indicated that future talks are likely."
"Trump’s Justices, With Much in Common, Take Different Paths",https://www.nytimes.com,['Adam Liptak'],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-neil-gorsuch.html,"There was little reason to predict those differences when the two men served as law clerks to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy starting in the summer of 1993. “We were in the middle of everything,” Justice Kavanaugh said in a 2017 interview, when he was still an appeals court judge.

The two clerks had already known each other for more than a decade, having attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Md., together. Justice Kavanaugh, now 54, was in the class of 1983. Justice Gorsuch, 51, was two years behind him.

As justices, though, the two men can be a study in contrasts. “Gorsuch is clearly more willing to sweep with a broader brush, appears less concerned about precedent and does not seem to have the same pragmatic streak that we see a little bit in Kavanaugh,” Professor Adler said.

Justice Gorsuch is a formalist who is committed to the interpretive tools of originalism, which looks to the meaning of the Constitution when it was adopted, and textualism, which focuses on statutory wording. He is suspicious of arguments grounded in pragmatism and impatient with lawyers who will not address him on his terms.

“We hear a lot about what makes sense in this room,” Justice Gorsuch said at an argument last month over whether a criminal statute was unconstitutionally vague. “I’m curious about what the law is.”

When he failed to get a satisfactory answer, he dismissed the lawyer. “Off you go,” he said.

That same day, in a statute of limitations case, Justice Kavanaugh indicated that he was inclined to take account of what makes sense. “If the law is murky and we can choose one path or another reasonably as a matter of law, wouldn’t we choose the more orderly, practical approach?” he asked.

Ross Guberman, an authority on legal writing and the author of “Point Taken: How to Write Like the World’s Best Judges,” said that Justice Gorsuch possesses the showier writing style."
"Man killed, at least 2 hurt in shootings near Trump Miami resort",https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/shooting-near-trump-miami-resort-man-killed-2-hurt,"A man was killed and at least two other people were injured Sunday in a pair of shootings near a South Florida resort bearing President Trump's name.

The Miami Herald reported that 43-year-old Mohammad Jradi was killed in the shooting that unfolded around 1:30 p.m. near the Trump International Beach Resort Miami in Sunny Isles Beach, just north of Miami Beach. A 5-year-old child was grazed by a bullet.

Witnesses told the paper that a woman also was shot after a fight broke out in front of the Trump building. The witnesses identified the woman who was shot as Kay Marie, the girlfriend of rapper NBA YoungBoy. The rapper was scheduled to perform Sunday night as part of the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

In addition, police were investigating a second shooting on a nearby causeway linking Sunny Isles Beach and Aventura in which one person suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Aventura police said they were working with Sunny Isles Beach Police and Miami-Dade police to determine whether the two shootings were related.

Trump favors democracy’s enemies. An Oval Office meeting Monday makes the point.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'May At Pm']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-favors-democracys-enemies-an-oval-office-meeting-monday-makes-the-point/2019/05/12/b2426c04-7346-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html,"HUNGARIAN PRIME Minister Viktor Orban has become a virtual pariah within the European Union because of his dismantling of his country’s democratic institutions, cruel treatment of asylum seekers and anti-Semitic provocations. But on Monday he is due to be welcomed to the White House by President Trump, who appears to prefer crude autocrats of Mr. Orban’s type to the liberal democratic leaders of the United States’ closest allies.

The Oval Office meeting will be a triumph for Mr. Orban, who was rightly shunned by Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and who shut down Hungary’s opposition media, eliminated independent courts, drove a prestigious U.S. university out of Budapest and spewed hateful rhetoric toward Muslims and, in more subtle terms, Jews. In March, Mr. Orban’s party was suspended from the European Parliament’s right-wing People’s Party because of such acts. Now, as elections to the European Parliament approach, he can flaunt his de facto endorsement by Mr. Trump.

U.S. officials portray the Hungarian leader’s rehabilitation as part of an effort to steer him away from Russia and China, with which his government has been cultivating ever-closer relations. But as the ambassador whom Mr. Trump posted in Budapest, David Cornstein, recently confirmed in an interview with the Atlantic, Mr. Trump’s interest in Mr. Orban goes well beyond the tactical. “I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn’t,” Mr. Cornstein said.

That “situation” includes nine continuous years in office thanks to increasingly unfair elections, the construction of a razor wire fence along Hungary’s southern border to prevent the entry of asylum seekers and the articulation of an ideology of “illiberal democracy” whose explicit aim is to preserve Hungary’s white and Christian identity. Mr. Orban’s last election campaign a year ago was centered on the claim that the Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, was plotting to overwhelm Hungary with Muslim immigrants.

Said Mr. Orban: “We are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward, but crafty; not honest, but base; not national, but international; does not believe in working, but speculates with money.”

Mr. Trump’s affinity for this demagogue is matched by his administration’s steadily worsening relations with traditionally close U.S. allies such as Germany and France. On the same day that the White House announced Mr. Orban’s visit, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As Europe’s centrist parties struggle with a growing challenge from far-right parties with racist and authoritarian agendas, the United States ought to be doing all it can to bolster liberal democracy, especially in those parts of Europe where its roots are shallow. Instead, with increasing boldness, Mr. Trump is siding with democracy’s enemies."
‘A dream ticket’: Black lawmakers pitch Biden-Harris to beat Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Heather Caygle', 'John Bresnahan', 'Jordyn Hermani', 'Carla Marinucci']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/12/joe-biden-kamala-harris-dream-ticket-1317561,"Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris may be the perfect match to take on President Donald Trump in 2020, according to the Congressional Black Caucus. | Kevin Wolf/AP Photo 2020 Elections ‘A dream ticket’: Black lawmakers pitch Biden-Harris to beat Trump Senior members of the Congressional Black Caucus say it’s an ideal ticket if the former vice president stays atop the polls.

The Congressional Black Caucus may have found an answer to its Joe Biden dilemma: Vice President Kamala Harris.

Some black lawmakers are agonizing over whether to back Biden or two members of the close-knit caucus — Sens. Harris and Cory Booker — who are also vying for the White House, according to interviews with a dozen CBC members.

Story Continued Below

But with the former vice president jumping out to a huge, if early, lead in the polls, several CBC members are warming to the idea of a Biden-Harris ticket to take on President Donald Trump.

“That would be a dream ticket for me, a dream ticket!” said Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.). “If she is not the nominee, that would be a dream ticket for this country.”

Harris is everything the 76-year-old Biden is not. The freshman senator from California is younger, a woman and a person of color. As Biden gets dinged for his bipartisan bromides, Harris is winning applause from progressives for her merciless cross-examination of Trump officials.

Democrats are also desperate to boost black turnout in 2020, blaming the drop-off from Barack Obama’s wins as one reason for Hillary Clinton’s defeat.

“Either combination there, I’d love,” said Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.). “I think he’s going to look to balance his ticket so that the ticket itself is more appealing. ... I think it would make sense and it wouldn’t surprise me if he picked a woman of color.”

No one in the caucus is declaring Biden the winner of a presidential race that has nearly two dozen candidates and is still nine months away from the first primary contest. And Democrats cautioned that they’re not counting out Harris or Booker and would be thrilled if either won the Democratic nomination. Both senators have actively courted members of the CBC.

Yet there is no question that Biden — thanks in part to his close relationship with Obama — is popular with African-American voters, according to several polls since he entered the race. That support inside the black community translates into backing from black lawmakers as well.

“But for the fact that we have two of our own who are both quite capable of being president, I’d say probably a lot of the members would’ve already announced for Biden,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).

Were Biden to prevail in the fight for the nomination, Harris would be many members’ preferred vice presidential pick.

“If [Biden] becomes the nominee, that certainly would be my choice,” said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), a senior member of the caucus. “Right now, I’m still believing that Harris can be the top of the ticket.”

“It would absolutely be a very strong ticket, no question about that,” Fudge added. “1 and 2, 2 and 1. Either way, it would be great.”

Biden has a deep well of support within the influential group of 55 black lawmakers, having served alongside many of them in his 36 years as a senator and eight years as vice president under the first African American president. Biden has already racked up some key endorsements within the caucus, including former CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.).

House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the highest-ranking African American in Congress, often speaks fondly of Biden, a longtime friend, though Clyburn has said he won’t endorse anyone before his home state’s primary.

“I said a few weeks ago that if [Biden] were to get in, everybody else would be running for second place. I said that over a month ago. And he got in, and the polls said everyone else is running for second place,” Clyburn said in an interview.

It should also be of no surprise that Biden is polling well among black Democratic primary voters, he noted.

“The data are clear that he has strong support among African Americans,” Clyburn said. “It’s just that simple. He’s had that for a long, long time, and he’s kept it steady so far.”

The Congressional Black Caucus isn’t expected to endorse in the Democratic race, although its political arm, CBC PAC, will likely wade into the crowded contest at some point. In the meantime, Biden, Harris, Booker and other candidates are all wooing members of the CBC, who have outsize influence with African-American voters.

Biden is a creature of Capitol Hill, with relationships that go back decades with some of the most senior members of the caucus. He happily refers to his former boss, the first black president, as “my buddy Barack” on the campaign trail.

“I don’t think people should underestimate the significance of this older white guy playing the role of second, a supportive second, to a younger man who is African American,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). “And people felt this was real and authentic, [Biden] wasn't faking it. There was a real friendship there.”

Biden also has a natural ease in the black community in a way that other white Democratic candidates don’t, according to some caucus members.

“Biden is very comfortable in African American circles. Sometimes a white politician in an all-black setting, you can feel the seed of nervousness,” Cleaver said. “With Biden, he’s just right at home. You can see it and feel it.”

Biden has made direct efforts to appeal to voters of color — using his opening video to blast Trump for saying there were “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and talking frequently since then about issues important to African American voters.

As vice president, Biden was frequently in touch with CBC leaders and would host an annual dinner with the entire caucus at his house to honor Black History Month. Biden has also taken steps to cultivate relationships with younger black lawmakers who came to Congress since Trump has been in the White House, reaching out to them via phone calls and requesting in-person meetings.

“He called me before he made his announcement to fill me in. And I was honored that he would call me to let me know,” said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), who has yet to endorse a candidate.

Biden is already running as if he were the Democratic nominee, with a tunnel vision focus on Trump. He and Harris also set off a flurry of social media speculation about a joint ticket in December after posing together for a quick photo.

Trump, too, is keeping close tabs on Biden’s candidacy — mentioning or tweeting about “Sleepy Joe” or “SleepyCreepy Joe” on a near daily basis since Biden officially announced his candidacy last month.

Still, some CBC members said Biden has to be careful not to underestimate other Democrats, including Harris, in his march to the nomination.

Biden faced criticism after earlier reports he was eyeing former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams as an early running mate. Abrams says she’s still considering seeking the top slot herself.

Announcing who he’d like as his vice presidential pick would be “premature and likely would backfire,” according to one CBC member who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

“The vice president’s team seems to be very sensitive to the notion that they have to go out and earn this,” the lawmaker added.

Harris is currently behind in the polls, consistently running in fourth or fifth place among Democratic hopefuls. The former prosecutor has found it difficult to retain the momentum of her promising campaign launch in January. Democrats, however, say a breakout moment for any of the candidates is still possible once the debates start next month.

“Whomever the nominee is, I think there has to be a woman on the ticket,” said Rep. Al Green (D-Texas). “And I think it is time for an African American woman to get that kind of consideration, whoever it happens to be.”"

DHS asks military for more help dealing with influx of migrants,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Ryan Browne']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/12/politics/homeland-security-military-immigration/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military for more help as it deals with the influx of migrants coming into the US, including tents for large numbers of them, two US administration officials told CNN.

One official said the DHS request was for single occupancy units.

The request, which was delivered to the Pentagon Friday night, came as Customs and Border Protection predicted it would surpass half a million migrants crossing the border so far this fiscal year. The number of apprehensions on the US-Mexico border is the highest since 2009

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is considering the request.

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

Collusion: How the State Department tried to save Voice of America from Soviet influence in WWII,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/collusion-how-the-state-department-tried-to-save-voice-of-america-from-soviet-influence-in-wwii,"Last week, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, marked World Press Freedom Day with an excellent speech. Amid powerful remarks in defense of press freedom, Cruz recounted how the U.S. State Department had tried several times to censor out President Reagan’s famous words, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,” from his 1987 address at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Three times, State Department staff had tried to delete this now-famous phrase, objecting that it was too belligerent. Three times, Reagan put it back in. As Cruz told the story, Reagan finally explained to them: ""You don’t understand. This is the whole point of the speech.""

I was in charge of the Voice of America Polish Service when Reagan delivered his Berlin Wall address. We reported on it, of course, but I remember that unlike refugee VOA journalists like myself, many VOA English newsroom reporters at that time were horrified by Ronald Reagan.

To many of my VOA newsroom colleagues, he was a dangerous warmonger. Fortunately, their view was not shared by most VOA journalists in the East European foreign language services. They admired Reagan’s courage, as did dissidents and most people in countries behind the Iron Curtain.

Voice of America did not report on Sen. Cruz’s speech and its fascinating details about the Cold War. This is interesting, because he gave it at the invitation of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which manages VOA. The agency streamed the speech live on Facebook, but this dysfunctional and obscure bureaucratic agency was only able to get five live viewers.

I think I know why VOA ignored Sen. Cruz’s speech. It’s not because his speech was not newsworthy. The answer lies within the ideologically-driven activism of some VOA officials and journalists, combined with their willingness to censor facts and viewpoints they don't like while promoting their own left-wing political causes on the taxpayer's dime.

Two years ago, reporters and editors in today’s VOA English newsroom had no problem playing a monologue video of American communist and Lenin Peace Prize winner Angela Davis. They presented her as a champion of human rights, failing to disclose her former support for the Soviet Union and Communist Party membership.

The State Department does not have a monopoly on poor political judgment. When one looks at the history of U.S. international broadcasting, left-wing Voice of America journalists were more eager supporters of Stalin and state socialism than most U.S. diplomats. In April 1943, the State Department intervened twice to save VOA, then in the Office of War Information, from the influence of pro-Soviet officials and VOA broadcasters. This included VOA’s first director, John Houseman, and VOA’s first chief news writer and news director, Communist author Howard Fast. After Fast was forced to resign from VOA in 1944 due to pressure from the State Department and the FBI, he was honored in 1953 with the Stalin Peace Prize, worth about $235,000 in today’s dollars.

Houseman, a Hollywood actor, was also forced to resign from his position as VOA director after Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles sent a secret memo to Franklin Roosevelt's White House warning against Soviet influence over the Office of War Information’s domestic and foreign propaganda programs. The State Department refused to give Houseman and Fast U.S. passports for government travel abroad.

But the State Department’s behind-the-scenes intervention against collusion with Soviet Russia at VOA was only partially successful. Also in 1943, Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle and other State Department diplomats tried to warn VOA not to embrace the Soviet propaganda lie about the Katyn massacre of thousands of Polish officers by the Soviet NKVD secret police. Their advice was ignored by OWI’s leadership. The FDR White House was not interested in countering this particular Soviet propaganda message, but when pro-Soviet VOA broadcasts started to threaten the lives of American soldiers by criticizing U.S. deals with Vichy France and Italy, FDR sided with the State Department and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower against the Office of War Information. Eisenhower later accused VOA’s communist sympathizers of “insubordination” against their own president.

During World War II, U.S. diplomats were not fully successful in eliminating foreign ideological influence over VOA broadcasts. The process of getting rid of pro-Soviet VOA journalists continued after the Office of War Information was abolished by President Harry Truman and VOA was moved to the State Department in 1945. Management reforms and the hires of new broadcasters who were opposed to communism were not completed at VOA until about 1952.

Contrary to conventional wisdom that journalists always seek the truth and cherish freedom, some of the best educated and experienced State Department diplomats were less fooled by Soviet propaganda during World War II than were Voice of America's officials and broadcasters. World War II VOA programs were mostly designed to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany and Japan, but U.S. government broadcasters also started to present the Soviet Union and Stalin as champions of freedom and human progress.

In later years some VOA officials and journalists participated in the cover-up of VOA’s early love affair with Stalin and Soviet communism. They misled Americans about VOA’s history of initially supporting Stalin’s takeover of Eastern Europe with Soviet-generated propaganda and disinformation. Eventually, pressure from Congress and public opinion turned VOA into a relatively successful voice in support of freedom during the later years of the Cold War, but the early history of VOA’s cheering for Stalin and socialism in Eastern Europe has been covered up and forgotten.

The danger of the Voice of America becoming a tool of foreign propaganda — be it Russian, Iranian or Chinese — and a tool of domestic partisan and ideological activism, reemerged in the last several years under the hapless Obama-era holdover management team in charge of the United States Agency for Global Media. Independent studies have shown pro-Putin, pro-Iranian regime, and pro-communist China bias in VOA programs, as well as illegal targeting of American audiences through Facebook ads.

Responding to media reports of internal scandals not only at VOA but also at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently called for getting a new CEO to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Pompeo said that the agency in charge of foreign media outreach must have “the right leadership so they can do the traditional mission — perhaps in a different information environment than we did back in the Cold War, but can perform its function in a way that is important and noble, and reflects the enormous resources that are — that American taxpayers have put towards that.”

“I’m very concerned about it,” Secretary Pompeo added.

More Americans should be concerned. Their tax money might be going to foreign propaganda, as some VOA officials and some (not all) U.S. government-hired journalists allow ideology and foreign influence to take precedence over the journalistic requirements of the VOA congressional charter: accuracy, balance, and nonpartisanship in Voice of America programs.

Is the attorney general the president's lawyer? Or the public's?,https://www.newsday.com,['Laura Figueroa Hernandez'],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/barr-attorney-general-debate-1.30900824,"WASHINGTON — As Attorney General William Barr faces calls to resign from congressional Democrats over his handling of the Mueller report release, the question of who the attorney general is primarily expected to serve — the president or the public — has once again become a point of contention.

Is the U.S. attorney general expected to be the president’s defender-in-chief, or is the office holder solely duty bound to the American public he or she was tapped to represent?

“The position of attorney general is one of conflicting loyalties,” said David Yalof, author of the book “Prosecution Among Friends: Presidents, Attorneys General, and Executive Branch Wrongdoing.” “Loyalty to the president who appointed him or her to carry out their agenda, and loyalty to the Justice Department and the rule of law … lots of presidents have dealt with it quite differently.”

Democrats have argued that Barr in five months as attorney general has acted more like President Donald Trump’s personal attorney than the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. They contend Barr’s rollout of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report — issuing a four-page summary before releasing a redacted version of the 448-page report — was designed to minimize the report’s most damaging details involving Trump.

""He is the attorney general of the United States of America, not the attorney general of Donald Trump,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters recently.

Barr has brushed aside Democrats’ complaints. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week he defended his decision to release his own summary first rather than release summaries of the report that had been written for public consumption by Mueller’s team.

“I did not believe that it was in the public interest to release additional portions of the report in piecemeal fashion, leading to public debate over incomplete information,” Barr told lawmakers.

Despite Barr’s assurances that his work has been apolitical, Democrats continue to point to Trump’s remarks in the Mueller report to make the case that the president, who often berated his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe, has long sought an attorney general to fight for his own interests.

The report, drawing from the sworn testimony of former White House Counsel Don McGahn, notes: “After the President learned of Sessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an Attorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder to have protected their presidents. The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney General ‘who to investigate.' ”

Former Justice Department officials and historians say while past presidents have varied in their appointments — some tapping political allies, while others promoted longtime civil servants with no close ties — there has been a long-standing tradition that the Justice Department runs its investigations independent of the Oval Office, to prevent the politicization of the nation’s top law enforcement agency.

“It’s extremely a major violation of the norms for the president to come in and say ‘prosecute so and so’,” said Nancy V. Baker, author of “Conflicting Loyalties: Law and Politics in the Attorney General's Office”

Baker, who reviewed the work of decades of former attorneys general for her book, said presidents have generally given their attorneys general “broad policy related directions” about the administration’s criminal justice priorities, but have largely avoided directing the Justice Department’s investigations.

Yalof, a political-science professor at the University of Connecticut, said that after the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon’s presidency, spurring widespread distrust in the Oval Office, “presidents understood much better that having the attorney general be close to the president could actually end up being a political problem because people would not necessarily trust the outcome” of their investigations.

Former White House Counsel Don McGahn, in testimony detailed in the Mueller report, recalled Trump complained after McGahn and then-White House adviser Stephen Bannon urged him not to discuss the Russia probe with Sessions.

“You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?,” Trump said, according to the Mueller report.

Baker, a professor emerita of political science at New Mexico State University, said that although John F. Kennedy tapped his brother Robert Kennedy to lead the Justice Department, Robert Kennedy’s actions were sometimes at odds with his brother’s desires.

Baker said on two occasions Robert Kennedy recused himself from high-profile investigations involving Kennedy backers. He passed the investigations — one dealing with kickbacks allegations surrounding a former New York Supreme Court Judge, and the other into a Kennedy family legal adviser’s finances — to other longtime Justice Department attorneys.

“Those are two examples of Bobby Kennedy, who was a politically active attorney general, explicitly not getting involved, not taking advice from his brother who to prosecute, and in fact, when it was someone who was tied to his brother’s success politically, or an important family friend, he recused himself,” Baker said.

Obama era officials have pushed back on Trump’s notion that Obama directed Holder’s investigations.

Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama holdover who briefly served under Trump, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” last month that the attorney general “is not the president’s lawyer.”

“The Department of Justice is not just another federal agency,” said Yates. “And the attorney general is not the president's lawyer, and I recall, when I was named United States attorney, we were all called to the White House for what was, essentially, a photo op with President Obama, and he came in and the first words out of his mouth were, ‘I may have appointed you but you don't represent me. You represent the people of the United States.’ And that's the way it's supposed to be.”

Ronald Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore Law School, and a former assistant attorney general under the Obama administration, said in an interview “the accusation that President Obama told Attorney General Holder who to investigate is false, ignorant and outrageous. In those years, there were firm policies and procedures that prevented the White House from directing or influencing federal criminal law investigations.”

Weich added: “The attorney general has a multifaceted role. He or she is a member of the president’s cabinet and properly carries out the administration’s policy goals. But there is a long and valuable tradition of DOJ independence when it comes to the conduct of federal law enforcement. It is improper for the White House to become involved in pending investigations or specific criminal cases.”

Barr, who previously served as attorney general under the late President George H.W. Bush, also weighed in on his perception of the office’s role, telling lawmakers in his January confirmation hearing: “The attorney general must ensure that the administration of justice — the enforcement of the law — is above and away from politics.”"
Former defense secretary Gates says it’s not ‘case closed’ on Russian interference,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'May At Pm']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-defense-secretary-gates-says-its-not-case-closed-on-russian-interference/2019/05/12/2a859e5e-74c6-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html,"Former defense secretary Robert Gates on Sunday pushed back against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s call for the country to move on from Robert S. Mueller III’s report, arguing that Russian interference in U.S. elections remains an urgent issue.

McConnell (R-Ky.) last week declared “case closed” on Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. But in a wide-ranging interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Gates said the United States has “not reacted nearly strongly enough” to Russia’s “blatant interference in 2016.”

“The piece of the Mueller report about Russian interference is not ‘case closed,’” said Gates, a Republican who was defense secretary under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “And, frankly, I think elected officials who depend on honest elections to get elected ought to place as a very high priority measures to protect the American electoral system against interference by foreigners.”

In a phone call with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin earlier this month, Trump discussed the end of the Mueller investigation but did not raise concerns about the possibility of Russian interference in the 2020 campaign.

Gates said Sunday that was “a mistake.”

“I think he should’ve said, ‘We’ve had this discussion, the evidence is in and don’t ever do this again or there will be consequences for Russia,’ ” he told host Margaret Brennan. “I think he very much should have raised it with him.”

Gates’s comments come on the same day that Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to press Putin on the issue during their scheduled meeting this week in Sochi, Russia.

“During your meeting with Vladimir Putin, it is critical that you warn him that any action to interfere in our elections will be met with an immediate and robust response,” Schumer said in the letter. “President Trump’s approach to dealing with President Putin, especially on this vital issue, must change. I urge you to make absolutely clear to President Putin that interference in U.S. elections will not be tolerated.”

Trump has repeatedly given mixed messages on U.S. policy toward Russia, including during a Fox Business Network interview this month in which he suggested that it was a “rumor” that Russia had persuaded embattled Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro not to flee the country — contradicting Pompeo’s statement on the matter.

Gates, who is chancellor of the College of William & Mary, speculated that Trump may be hesitant to confront Russia because of a “peculiar relationship with Putin” or because he “feels like any acknowledgment of Russian involvement in the 2016 elections somehow delegitimizes his being elected president.”

“I don’t know what the mix of motives are,” Gates said. “But the interesting thing is everybody around the president actually has a much more realistic view of the Russians, and that includes up on the Hill.”

He argued that in addition to sanctions, the Trump administration should consider “using some of our own capabilities to go back into Russia and, let’s say, inform the Russian people of the magnitude of corruption of Putin.”

“I think we can create more problems for him — we have the capabilities to do that,” Gates said.

Gates also criticized Trump’s handling of relations with Tehran, arguing that the president had erred in scrapping the Iran nuclear deal “in part because it ended up isolating us as well as the Iranians.”

The Iranian Nuclear Deal had some “deep flaws” Gates said but “it was a mistake to walk away from it” as it “ended up isolating us as well as the Iranians.” He added that Iran’s “meddling and interference in the Middle East” needs to be addressed. pic.twitter.com/YQDf2kAtgJ — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) May 12, 2019

“I believe the original agreement had some very deep flaws,” Gates said. “But once it was signed, I think it was a mistake to walk away from it. We should have then used various other pressures to address these other issues.”

Trump declared last week that former secretary of state John F. Kerry “should be prosecuted” for meeting with Iranian officials after leaving office in 2017. Gates dismissed that possibility on Sunday, telling Brennan, “Yeah, I mean this is not going to happen.”

“American politicians and former leaders talk to other leaders all the time,” he said.

Gates did, however, say that it would be “a mistake in judgment” to try to negotiate with a foreign government over policy issues after leaving office.

“I think trying to hold a negotiation, if you will, with a foreign leader when you’re out of power is a mistake . . . There’s only one president at a time,” he said.

Here's where the Pentagon is pulling $1.5B to put toward Trump's wall,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/heres-where-the-pentagon-is-pulling-1-5b-to-put-toward-trumps-wall,"The Pentagon is redirecting $1.5 billion in funding that was meant to be spent on a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile, reconnaissance plane, overseas war efforts, and other projects to build 80 miles of border wall along the U.S.-Mexico boundary, according to a new report.

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced the diversion of funds Friday, but a Defense Department document recently obtained by the Washington Post shows the money is being pulled from several other projects.

“The Department carefully selected sources for the reprogramming that are excess or early to need and will not adversely affect military preparedness,” the document said.

Some of the money will come from the Air Force's ballistic missile program, Minuteman III; Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS); a ""space test experiment"" connected to the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency; ""Overseas Contingency Operations""; and its new Blended Retirement System.

The Associated Press reported last Friday that $604 million will be pulled from funding for the Afghan and coalition forces.

Shanahan said this is the final pool of money the Pentagon will make available for border fence construction. It pulled around $1 billion in Army personnel dollars in March on top of $3.6 billion in military construction money.

At the conclusion of the partial government shutdown in February, Trump announced plans to use $600 million from the Treasury Department's drug forfeiture fund; $2.5 billion from the Defense Department's drug interdiction program; and $3.5 billion from a military construction fund."
"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

Russian agent Maria Butina thought her notes on US politics were ’valuable’ to Moscow,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/russian-agent-maria-butina-thought-her-notes-on-us-politics-were-valuable-to-moscow,"Russian agent Maria Butina said she believed her notes on U.S. politics would be “valuable” to Russian officials.

Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison last month for conspiring with a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political circles in the U.S. and influence the country’s relations with Moscow.

She was the only Russian arrested amid special counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, though charges were not brought against her by Mueller’s team.

In an interview with NPR airing Friday, Butina said she knew Alexander Torshin, a longtime figure in Russian politics, was giving the information she passed on to him to Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

""I said that I would be honored because, well, I am a young woman and there you have people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would consider my notes, my analysis, as valuable,"" Butina said. ""It was very pleasant for me. So of course I said, 'Of course, yes.'""

Butina, 30, has maintained that she was not a Russian spy and that she would have registered as a foreign agent if she had known she had to.

Federal prosecutors argued Butina was a national security threat who worked to find Americans who could eventually provide intelligence to the Kremlin. Her lawyers said she was simply a gun rights activist who came to study in the U.S. and wanted to improve relations between Washington and Moscow and loosen Russian gun laws.

“I came here as a peace builder,” she said. “I am embarrassed that instead of creating peace, by not registering [as a foreign agent], I created discord.”

Robert Anderson, the former assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division and the Justice Department’s expert witness in the case, said the Kremlin will be able to use the information Butina passed on to Torshin about the individuals she had access to in Trumpworld and the National Rifle Association “for years to come in their efforts to spot and assess Americans who may be susceptible to recruitment as foreign intelligence assets.”

A federal judge gave Butina credit for the nine months she has already spent in jail, meaning she’ll spend nine months in prison before she’s deported to Russia.

Butina said she has no concerns about her safety when she returns to Russia because people ""know as a matter of fact that I am not a spy nor do I have any secret information.""

""I don't think I have any problems or I could have any concerns about my safety,"" she said. ""I don't see that happening.""

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker admits he is 'nervous' about DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-admits-he-is-nervous-about-doj-inspector-general,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker admitted on Friday that he is “nervous” about DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into the conduct of the DOJ and the FBI during the Trump-Russia probe.

Sitting down with with Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes in a crowded room at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Baker said he is “assuming that they will dig and find stuff” and that “we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.” But Baker defended the FBI's actions, including its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Horowitz’s investigation is particularly focused on alleged FISA abuse and the reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele in FISA applications targeting Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS. The investigation is expected to finish in May or June.

Wittes said that Baker “had expressed great confidence in the way you guys conducted yourselves, in the integrity of these fundamental judgments, in the opening with respect to two separate investigations and with the respect to the handling of this FISA application.” Wittes then asked Baker: “So, how nervous are you about the IG?”

Baker said he is “always nervous about the IG,"" adding that “they’re coming in after the fact to look at what we did."" At the time, he said, the FBI was “trying to do it in real time and having the pressure to deal with these threats as they were coming.”

Baker contended that he was “confident in the judgments that I made at the time based on the information that I had available to me.” But he left open the possibility that others may have engaged in wrongdoing, saying, “I’m sure they will find things that I didn’t know at the time and maybe that others didn’t know at the time.”

“There were facts that existed in the Bureau that were known by certain people that weren’t known by others including me, that’s certainly possible and that happens frequently,” Baker said. “And so, I’m assuming that they will dig and find stuff like that. So, we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

During the event Friday, Baker defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier and stressed that he examined the FISA warrant applications on Page before they got signed and sent to the court. He said he was “comfortable” with their contents and was confident that the process remained “lawful.” Regarding the FISA court, Baker said: “These are federal judges for goodness' sake. They know how to evaluate wiretap applications. ... These are serious, serious judges.”

On the bureau’s handling of Steele, Baker said, “We’re not stupid. The FBI. We’re not stupid.”

And Baker said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker. ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line,"" he said.

“We are the Federal Bureau of Investigations, not the Federal Bureau of Conclusions,” Baker said defensively.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. And the New York Times reported that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Baker mentioned that he’s faced investigations before. “I’ve been investigated — or matters that I’ve worked on have been investigated — many times by the Inspector General. It’s not a pleasant process. It’s just not. The people are pleasant but the process is not the most enjoyable,"" he said.

Baker may have been referring to an alleged criminal leaks investigation that had been opened on him, which had been reported on as early as December 2017. He confirmed the existence of an investigation but declined to provide many specifics, saying, “Yes there is an investigation with respect to matters in which I was involved that is still open that I have cooperated fully with. I met with the investigative team for many hours over many days. That took place about a year and a half ago.”

“I haven’t heard anything since then … other than to hear from the Department that the matter is still open.” Baker said. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal.”

Baker was appointed as the FBI general counsel in January 2014 and was later reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, Baker resigned from the FBI and has since written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

As the event ended, Baker summed up his thoughts on all of these investigations. “Hindsight is 20/20,” he remarked."

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Kelsey Snell'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721876476/house-democrats-subpoena-trump-tax-returns,"House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""

President Donald Trump lashed out at Don McGahn on Saturday, tweeting that he was “Never a big fan” of the former White House counsel amid an ongoing battle between House Democrats and the administration over documents and testimony related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration,” the president wrote online. “Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!”

Story Continued Below

The broadside follows a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal that McGahn rebuffed a request from the White House last month to publicly state that he did not believe the president obstructed justice when Trump ordered McGahn to seek Mueller’s firing in June 2017.

According to the redacted version of the special counsel’s report released by the Justice Department in April, Trump instructed McGahn to inform Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller must be removed. McGahn refused Trump’s subsequent request to refute press reports of the president’s directive, according to Mueller’s report.

McGahn, who stepped down as the White House’s top lawyer in October, was one of Mueller’s most prolific witnesses within the upper echelons of the Trump administration. But on Tuesday, he refused to comply with a congressional subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee to produce documents having to do with Mueller’s probe, deferring to the White House.

The committee’s subpoena also demanded that McGahn testify publicly on May 21, though it remains unclear whether he will appear before the panel.

Trump told Fox News last week that McGahn should not testify before Congress, and previously denied in a tweet last month that he charged McGahn with ousting Mueller.

“As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so,” the president wrote online. “If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.”

In a tweet earlier Saturday, Trump blasted Democratic lawmakers who “only want to talk about Obstruction” after Mueller’s report found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election.

That message was one of nearly six dozen tweets or retweets posted to Trump’s Twitter feed Saturday. The president spent several hours at his Virginia golf club before returning to the White House in the afternoon, according to pool reports."
Kaul shifts direction of Wisconsin Department of Justice,https://www.weau.com,[],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/Kaul-shifts-direction-of-Wisconsin-Department-of-Justice-509818651.html,"Wisconsin's new Democratic attorney general is shifting the state Justice Department away from his Republican predecessor's conservative stances on everything from health care to high-capacity wells.

Josh Kaul defeated Attorney General Brad Schimel in November as part of a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices.

In his first four months in office, Kaul has fulfilled his campaign promise to withdraw Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.

He has also switched sides in lawsuits over whether the state Department of Natural Resources can legally impose tighter regulations on factory farms and high-capacity wells, re-aligning with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin.

Republicans say Kaul can't be trusted to defend GOP-passed laws. But Kaul says he's not being ideological, he just views the law differently.

US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."

(Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)

Federal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a “substantially related” case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department’s second-highest-ranking official.

James Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies. The major Chinese telecom equipment-maker was indicted in January on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of Iran sanctions, and conspiracy to launder money and to obstruct justice.

[Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions]

The high-profile case has drawn much publicity as it is taking place against the backdrop of President Trump’s efforts to seal a trade deal with China and an attempt by his administration to keep Huawei out of the global 5G wireless networks on national security grounds.

In a redacted motion filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors argued that while Cole is defending Huawei, his work in the related investigation, which they did not disclose, “creates the real risk that he will breach his duty of confidentiality to the [Department of Justice] by relying on information he obtained while representing the department.”

Moreover, they said, “there is a risk that Cole will breach his duty of loyalty to the department by making arguments on behalf of the defendants that contradict positions he previously took while representing the DOJ.”

Neither Cole nor his attorney responded to a request for comment.

The move to disqualify is fairly unusual, but analysts note that if the government thinks there is a conflict of interest, prosecutors have an obligation to bring this concern to the court’s attention.

Cole, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm, informed the Justice Department in January that he was representing Huawei. Later that month, the department informed Cole that he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.

In a follow-up meeting, Cole and representatives of the Justice Department and the FBI discussed the issue, and after giving Cole a one-day clearance, the government provided him with “privileged and classified” information “in order to have a fulsome discussion,” prosecutors said.

In March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel “were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.”

Later that month, he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference, on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole’s motion for the time being. Last week, prosecutors asked the court to remove him.

“It’s a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole’s pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,” said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. “But the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.”

While the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department’s most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.

“It’s difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. “The court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination.”"
DOJ charges Chinese man over 'one of the worst data breaches in history' which took 79 million people’s personal data from Anthem health insurers,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Bill Bostock'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-hacker-stole-data-78-million-anthem-doj-say-2019-5,"A Chinese national has been charged with orchestrating the biggest data hack in US healthcare history, in which 79 million people had their personal information stolen.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""

"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
"Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: 'Rumors' Trump is quashing DOJ, FBI investigations",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-rumors-trump-is-quashing-doj-fbi-investigations,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Friday there are ""rumors"" that President Trump is quashing investigations run by the Justice Department and the FBI.

During an interview on MSNBC, Baker told host Rachel Maddow he decided to speak out because of Trump's bullying tactics.

He said ""it could have a significant negative impact in the long run"" because people are worried about their careers and reputations.

""When the president of the United States starts to go at you on Twitter it's ... unnerving,"" he said. ""If you're concerned about your reputation and your long-term career, you're more likely to be hesitant to do things that will attract that type of ire.""

Maddow asked if he is aware of any investigations that have been impeded because of Trump's behavior, and Baker said he has ""heard rumors to that effect"" but none that he could confirm. He did acknowledge that this dynamic was ""currently"" at work.

""Whether it's true or not, it's something to worry about,"" he said. He noted that ""certain types of investigations, especially as they start to touch the political system or political leaders"" are the ones to worry about.

Baker's interview comes after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, which details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. He declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

The FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Baker, who is under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media, has been subject to criticism by Trump for his role in allowing the use of an unverified dossier to obtain the authority to spy on a member of his 2016 campaign, Carter Page.

“Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled,” Trump tweeted in January. “They relied heavily on the unverified Trump ‘Dossier’ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for ‘a Russia probe.’ This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax.”

Baker said Trump's intimidation tactics against the FBI are ""very dangerous,"" but believes that the career officials at the bureau are highly resilient and are going to ""resist"" Trump as much as they can."

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not “in the same class” as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

“Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,” Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

“History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,” Khan said. “President Trump is not in the same class as those two.”

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit — but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan “rude” and “ignorant” on “Good Morning Britain.”

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. “It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,” Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.”

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

“The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,” Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. “There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.”

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in “Hugh Grant-type, public scene,” referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie “Love Actually.”

“We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn’t do so,” Khan said. “Your relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.”"
US Treasury Ironically Accusing Vietnam of Currency Manipulation,https://beincrypto.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-ironically-accusing-vietnam-currency-manipulation/,"Recent months have seen increasing tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) via increases in interest rates. These have come in response to a robust US economy, a high-flying stock market, and a strong US dollar.

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong — the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country’s actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam’s active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam’s tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‘trustless’ environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

DOJ brass praise Rosenstein’s Russia probe leadership at send-off ceremony,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-brass-praise-rosensteins-russia-probe-leadership-at-send-off-ceremony,"Top current and former Justice Department leadership praised Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for his “exceptional” leadership throughout the Russia investigation at his send-off ceremony Thursday, marking the conclusion of his nearly 30-year tenure at the agency.

Rosenstein was honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Building Thursday, following submitting his resignation to President Trump last month. Rosenstein sat on stage between Attorney General Bill Barr, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director Christopher Wray—all of whom touted Rosenstein’s record and character throughout his career, but specifically over the last two years.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

“Rod, you did your duty as it fell upon you,” Sessions, who resigned last year after the midterm elections, said on Thursday. “You didn’t ask for it—that’s for sure.”

Rosenstein, 54, previously served as deputy assistant attorney general and a U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland. But during the Trump administration, he became deputy attorney general to Sessions. Rosenstein ultimately took oversight of the Russia investigation upon Sessions’ recusal in early 2017 due to his work with the Trump campaign.

Sessions added that Rosenstein “didn’t start” the investigation, and noted that sometimes, “these things just become unstoppable.”

“Decisions had to be made, and those decisions fell to him,” Sessions continued, adding that decisions were made “all in accordance with procedures of the Justice Department.”

“Rod understood better than most that justice would be best served by appointing a special counsel.”

He added: “You have honorably overseen this process, which has affirmed the rule of law and achieved a degree of justice.”

Sessions called Rosenstein a “friend and a loyal partner,” and reminisced on their “many wonderful times"" together.

Wray also praised Rosenstein and thanked him for his “dedication and service.""

“I have been grateful for Rod’s counsel and support,” Wray said. “A friend whose service has weathered the test of time.”

Rosenstein submitted his resignation following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Rosenstein worked alongside Barr and Mueller, to determine which portions of the report could be released to Congress and to the public, and which needed redactions to protect sources and methods and grand jury material.

Barr himself has fallen under intense scrutiny over the handling of the report. The House Judiciary Committee this week voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying documents.

But Barr praised Rosenstein on Thursday and said he has been “fortunate” to work with him.

“It’s been a real privilege and pleasure to have him with me these last several weeks,” Barr said, adding that Rosenstein has “exceptional intelligence, sound judgment crafted from experience, composure even amid scrutiny” and an “upbeat spirit” and “sense of humor.”

“He is an exceptional leader,” Barr said and presented Rosenstein with a flag that was flown above the main Justice Department.

Rosenstein fell into the political crosshairs throughout his tenure and was on the receiving end of the president’s ire over the Russia investigation.

Early on in his oversight of the probe, on May 8, 2017, at his recommendation, Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Just a week later, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller and took oversight of that probe until November 2018, when former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker took over.

IMPRISONING BILL BARR IS LEFT'S NEW RALLYING CRY: 'HAVE HIM LOCKED UP'

Rumors of Rosenstein’s resignation, or even firing, swirled for months—especially after Trump accused him of pursuing a “treasonous” plot against him. Last year, a report revealed that during a meeting, Rosenstein suggested wearing a “wire” to record the president - some of those there said he was joking - and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The meeting reportedly took place in the days after Comey’s firing.

Fox News learned that the meeting included several high-profile FBI officials, including former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI counsel Lisa Page on May 16, 2017. Mueller was appointed as special counsel the following day. Rosenstein, though, repeatedly denied pursuing a recording of the president and pushed back on claims of considering invoking the amendment.

But last month, Rosenstein officially resigned, and thanked Trump for “the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens.’”

On Thursday, after thanking his Justice Department colleagues, Rosenstein took the podium and said: “I leave here confident that justice is in good hands. It’s in your hands.”

"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump’s $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation’s two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan’s third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan’s second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, “Given the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.”

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

“The problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president’s budget will do that,” said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president’s request."
"State Department should be investigated too, for actions overseas",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'L. Todd Wood']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/9/state-department-should-be-investigated-too-for-ac/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

With the investigations of the investigators beginning under the watch of Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department, we would like to highlight that it has not just been the FBI, and America’s other intelligence agencies, who were corrupted during the Obama administration.

The State Department is also knee deep in the Deep State with Obama holdovers working their seditious black magic in the cubicles of Foggy Bottom and around the world.

We have written extensively on these pages about the corrupt actions of Ambassador *Donald Lu in Albania, where he used the powers of his office to interfere in the political discourse of a foreign country, supporting the socialist government of Prime Minister Edi Rama, a man who is so close to Leftist philanthropist and activist George Soros that he was invited to his wedding. Mr. Lu even went so far as to cancel American visas of Albanian opposition figures in his bid to curry favor with the far left and ensure socialist rule. He has since left Albania for Kyrgyzstan, where he is up to his old tricks, once again interfering in local affairs and pushing the globalist agenda, right under the nose of the leadership in Washington.

Mr. Lu’s supposed replacement for Albania, former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Kathleen Ann Kavalec, had her nomination withdrawn from consideration in Congress after information surfaced that she was connected to the Fusian GPS attempted coup by the Deep State.

The current U.S. Charge d’affaires Leyla Moses-Ones was caught blatantly and arrogantly tweeting against her boss, President Trump last year. More precisely, she retweeted a disloyal Twitter ramble about Mr. Trump by possibly soon to be indicted former head of the FBI, James Comey. Once exposed, Moses-Ones’ tweet was swiftly deleted.

We have also written about how the American embassy in Tirana has been actively involved in ‘judicial reform’ in Albania, which has led to complete lawlessness in the country of oligarch rule, because no constitutional court has been empaneled. That was the goal all along of course. The law was written by Soros consultants.

Former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, meanwhile, was caught ‘unmasking’ scores of Americans during her tenure with the Obama administration. This situation has not really been delved into by authorities, as the Trump-Russia hoax has sucked most of the oxygen from the room for the past two and a half years. Ms. Power’s actions should be investigated, however. Why in the world would the ambassador to the United Nations need to unmask American citizens via FISA surveillance? Hopefully we will know the answer to that question one day.

Just this week, the American representative to Ukraine, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was forced out two months early from her post. The allegation is that she played a role in State Department collusion with the Ukrainian government to ensure the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by releasing damaging information on Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

Reports are that Ukraine’s prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Ms. Yovanovitch actually gave him a “list of people whom we should not prosecute” during their first meeting. Of course, these were allegedly all Obama administration officials.

The Soros’ cancer runs deep and wide throughout the State Department, where American tax dollars are a convenient piggy bank for his army of NGOs around the world which routinely are granted large amounts of money to work the open borders and open society globalist agenda.

This has to stop.

Americans are tired of big government working behind their backs for other nations and other agendas rather than Trump’s America First. To fully drain the swamp, Foggy Bottom needs to receive a visit from the Trump plumber.

Suicides on VA properties sound the alarm on veteran care,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Dean Reynolds'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-military-veteran-suicides-on-veterans-affairs-properties-sound-the-alarm-on-veteran-care/,"Veterans can talk with a trained counselor through the Veterans Crisis Line.

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
U.S. EPA proposes hike in biofuel mandate to 20.04 billion gallons in 2020: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels/epa-proposes-hike-in-biofuel-mandate-to-20-04-billion-gallons-in-2020-sources-idUSKCN1SF2J6,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed increasing the volume of biofuels refiners must blend into their fuel annually to 20.04 billion gallons in 2020, from 19.92 billion gallons in 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

The proposed mandate, now under review by other government agencies before being finalized, includes 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol, unchanged from 2019. It also includes 5.04 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, like those made from agricultural wastes, up from 4.92 billion in 2019, the sources said.

The EPA is charged with setting biofuel blending requirements for the refining industry as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a more than decade-old regulation that is aimed at helping farmers and reducing U.S. dependence on oil.

The policy has helped farmers by creating a huge market for ethanol and other biofuels, but oil refiners say compliance can cost a fortune.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud confirmed the agency submitted a proposal for review, but did not comment on its contents.

“The proposal is currently under interagency review, which places the Trump administration on track to release the Renewable Fuel Standard Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) on time for the third consecutive year,” he said.

As part of the advanced biofuel proposal, the agency set mandates for cellulosic fuel at 540 million gallons and non-cellulosic at 4.5 billion, according to the sources.

It also proposed a biodiesel mandate of 2.43 billion gallons for 2021, unchanged from 2020, they said. The EPA sets biodiesel mandates a year in advance.

Small refineries can be exempted from biofuel blending if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain, and the Trump administration made extensive use of such exemptions in the last two years.

That has saved refiners money but angered the corn lobby, which argues the practice erodes biofuel demand."
Schiff subpoenas DOJ for unredacted Mueller report and counterintel info,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/08/adam-schiff-subpoena-mueller-report-1313078,"Alex Wong/Getty Images mueller investigation Schiff subpoenas DOJ for unredacted Mueller report and counterintel info

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to the Justice Department on Wednesday for the unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in addition to all of the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information collected during the 22-month investigation.

The subpoena comes after Schiff (D-Calif.) and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, made a rare joint request for the documents. Schiff said the Justice Department had yet to respond to the committee’s request, prompting him to issue a subpoena.

“The department has repeatedly failed to respond, refused to schedule any testimony, and provided no documents responsive to our legitimate and duly authorized oversight activities,” Schiff said in a statement.

“The department repeatedly pays lip service to the importance of a meaningful accommodation process, but it has only responded to our efforts with silence or outright defiance,” Schiff added. “Today, we have no choice but to issue a subpoena to compel their compliance.”

The committee’s subpoena requires the Justice Department to turn over the documents by May 15.

Schiff and Nunes penned joint letters to Barr — one on March 27 and another on April 25 — demanding the full Mueller report and its supporting materials. In the second letter, the lawmakers threatened a subpoena “absent meaningful compliance” by the end of last week.

In his letter to Barr informing the attorney general of the subpoena, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee required the information in order to “discharge its unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities,” including conducting oversight, examining potential national security issues and drawing up legislation to address vulnerabilities.

Schiff said the Justice Department claimed that it was accommodating his and Nunes’ request by allowing the lawmakers — in addition to 10 other senior members of Congress — to view a less-redacted version of the report.

“Neither of these responses amounted to a good faith effort to negotiate an accommodation of the committee’s request,” Schiff wrote, adding that his staff reminded the Justice Department of its “expansive and voluminous” production of documents related to the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

“These materials were of the precise type the department now claims it is prohibited from giving to the full committee, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information, documents related to third parties, and those pertaining to ongoing investigations,” Schiff wrote.

The committee’s announcement comes the same day the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel’s subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence.

Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the full report and its underlying materials — at Barr’s urging — in order to prevent the Justice Department from complying with the committee’s subpoena.

Schiff’s and Nunes’ numerous requests for the full Mueller report come despite efforts by Republicans on the Judiciary panel to back the Justice Department’s position that Congress does not have a right to the materials — in particular, the grand-jury information.

Dispute over Bible at Manchester VA hospital divides veterans,https://www.concordmonitor.com,"['Leah Willingham -', 'Wilson Ring -', 'Jim Gomez -']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.concordmonitor.com/Northwood-NH-veteran-bible-display-at-manchester-va-25467746,"An Air Force veteran is suing the Manchester VA Medical Center over the display of this Bible.

John Newman, pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, holds up his Bible on his property on Lucas Pond in Northwood on Friday. GEOFF FORESTER / Monitor staff

John Newman, pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, holds his Bible in front of the cross at his home compound on Lucas Pond in Northwood on Friday, May 10, 2019. GEOFF FORESTER—Monitor staff

Religion played an important role in John Newman’s Irish-Catholic family when he was a young boy growing up in Newfoundland, Canada, but he says it wasn’t until he faced combat in Vietnam that he fully realized his belief in God.

“Your most heavily involved combat veterans, they find a piece of faith in there somewhere, and they cry out to God one way or another, I know I did, when you think you’re going to get killed and the bullets are flying,” he said.

Newman recalled several close brushes with death during his service, including a harrowing rescue mission where he and his men went into enemy territory to find a U.S. aircraft that had wrecked. The pilot died when the plane went down, he said, but Newman and his men made it out alive. He later received a Bronze Star for that mission.

Through the decades that followed the war, Newman’s faith grew. He is the pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, a church he established in 1986.

His identity as a veteran has also remained important in his life, attending reunions with other men from his battalion and playing bagpipes at memorial services at the Veteran Cemetery in Boscawen.

Newman has been receiving medical care at the Manchester VA ever since he returned home. When he learned that a group of veterans was calling for the removal of a Bible on display at the hospital, he grew frustrated and feared it could set a precedent to remove other religious symbols from veteran memorials.

In Newman’s opinion, the Bible in dispute over at the VA – which was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II – represents more than Christianity.

“That Bible is probably the best thing there because it represents all religions and so many different sects of religion,” he said in an interview at his Northwood home tucked away on Lucas Pond. “I’m very disappointed in these guys.”

The display is called the Missing Man Table and honors missing veterans and prisoners of war. The table is stationed at the main entranceway to the hospital and is sponsored by Northeast POW/MIA Network.

A federal lawsuit was filed against the VA this week in Concord, demanding the Bible be removed immediately and permanently.

The plaintiff is James Chamberlain, an Air Force veteran and New Hampshire resident as well as a devout Christian. The lawsuit, penned by Chamberlain’s attorney, Lawrence Vogelman, argues the inclusion of the Bible is unconstitutional.

The lawsuit says the government cannot “give favoritism to one religious belief at the expense of others.”

“We would all be outraged if the MVAMC only provided care to Christians, or denied care to non-believers, or those who worship their God in other ways,” the suit reads. “The placement of a Christian Bible on this sacred table is just as objectionable.”

In January, 14 veterans who also receive care at the Manchester VA submitted complaints about the Bible display to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, a civil rights advocacy organization for active military members and veterans, according to the suit.

Shortly after the MRFF received the complaints, the organization’s president, Michael Weinstein, called the Manchester VA leadership and demanded the Bible be removed, according to the lawsuit. Weinstein received an email later that day from the acting staff assistant to the director of the Manchester VA saying the Bible would be taken off the display.

“I want you to know that can inform your clients that the Manchester VAMC has the utmost respect and admiration for all Veterans, regardless of belief,” the email read, according to the suit. “As such, we are going to be removing the Bible from the display to better serve all veterans.”

Less than a month later, on Feb. 23, some of the veterans who called for the Bible’s removal reported to the MRFF that the Bible had returned to the display and was locked in a plexiglass box.

It was at this point, according to the court papers, that Chamberlain came forward as another complainant and was willing to be the named plaintiff in a lawsuit, despite also receiving care at the VA.

“Despite his strong personal religious beliefs, he believes that the Christian Bible has no place being displayed on the POW/MIA table,” the lawsuit reads. “As a Christian, he respects and loves all his military brothers and sisters and does not want to be exclusionary by the placement of the Christian Bible.”

The other complainants, who come from a variety of religious backgrounds, wanted to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation, according to the suit.

The press secretary for the Department of Veteran Affairs, Curt Cashour, issued a statement shortly after news broke that the Manchester VA was being sued.

“This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,” Cashour said.

When the Bible was removed, officials at the VA say they received “an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action.”

The Bible was returned to the table after the hospital consulted their lawyers. Cashour said the decision to initially remove the Bible was made “out of an abundance of caution.”

“We apologize to the veterans, families and other stakeholders who were offended by our incorrect removal of this Bible,” he said.

Newman, a Vietnam veteran from Northwood, said he believes the VA made a knee-jerk decision to pull the Bible off the table after hearing the complaints.

“Every time there is one voice against something ... we immediately bend,” he said. “This erosion, it starts with this Bible issue, and when one thing starts there’s a domino effect. We have a table with a Bible on it at our Veterans Cemetery. Once they start with this, do they want to take everything away?”

Shanahan’s nomination comes as the Pentagon chief ‘spins a lot of plates’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/shanahans-nomination-comes-as-the-pentagon-chief-spins-a-lot-of-plates,"SHANAHAN GETS THE JOB: Patrick Shanahan learned yesterday afternoon during a visit to the White House that after serving more than four months as acting defense secretary, he’ll be nominated by President Trump to keep the job.

The official announcement came in a tweet from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who said that over the last several months Shanahan has proven “he is beyond qualified” to lead the Department of Defense.

The long-expected nomination comes two weeks after an investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general cleared Shanahan of allegations that he attempted to exert undue influence on behalf of his former employer Boeing.

CALLED MOM: A “very excited” Shanahan spoke briefly with reporters outside the Pentagon as he awaited the arrival of Japan’s chief cabinet secretary and said one of the first things he did was make a phone call. “I called my mom. She was super happy.” Asked about his priorities once confirmed, Shanahan said simply, “Do the job.”

Shanahan has been juggling multiple crises — Iran, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela, and Afghanistan — all while facing a showdown with Congress over the president's budget, which will require an elusive bipartisan agreement to be fully funded. “As you can tell, there are real-world events that happen every day, and so you have to spin a lot of plates,” he said.

In his formal statement, Shanahan said he was honored by Trump’s intention to nominate him. “If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy. I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.”

PLENTY OF SUPPORT: While Shanahan has his critics on Capitol Hill, who think his résumé is light on foreign policy experience, most lawmakers seem to understand that as he seeks to carry out Trump’s directives, he’s not always defending policies he created or supported.

Earlier this month Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., questioned Shanahan about a dubious White House plan to get around spending limits by shifting almost $100 billion to the overseas contingency operations account, or OCO.

“This OCO thing is a gimmick. We all know it's a gimmick,” Cole lectured Shanahan, but then gave him a pass. “Look, I know who you work for. And I know that OMB, you know, sets these things up.”

Republicans have already signaled they will support his confirmation. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement that “after working with him closely over the last few months, I welcome his selection.”

“I applaud the nomination,” said Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “Pat Shanahan has proven his willingness and ability to take on important reforms at DOD.”

And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. — who by his own account locked horns with Shanahan in a tense exchange at the Munich Security Conference in February — also signaled he’ll vote to confirm him.

Graham, who is no longer on the Armed Services Committee but remains an influential voice on national security issues, called Shanahan “a logical choice” to be Trump’s second defense secretary. “He has demonstrated to me his detailed understanding that a strong, modern, and well-trained military is essential in a dangerous and complex world.”

Graham seems to be over his irritation with Shanahan for not being a more forceful advocate for keeping U.S. troops in Syria after Trump ordered a full withdrawal in December. Graham told Shanahan at the conference, “That’s the dumbest f—ing idea I’ve ever heard.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Every new administration makes the same vow, promising to overhaul the Pentagon’s arcane and notoriously inefficient acquisition rules that consistently result in weapons programs that are over budget and overdue.

This morning, Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s under secretary for acquisition and sustainment, will brief reporters on the latest reforms designed to spend the taxpayer’s money on smarter purchases. The rare on-camera press briefing will be live streamed at 10 a.m. at www.defense.gov/Watch/Live-Events .

TRUMP BLAMES KERRY: President Trump suggested yesterday that were it not for illegal interference by former secretary of state John Kerry, he might well have been able to conduct productive talks with Iran over its nuclear program by now.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump said at a White House event. “You know, John Kerry speaks to them a lot. John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act. And, frankly, he should be prosecuted on that.”

The Logan Act bars private citizens from conducting unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments. No has been convicted of violating the 1799 law, although some suggested fired national security adviser Michael Flynn may have run afoul of it in his discussions with the Russians in the weeks before Trump took office.

The Boston Globe reported last May that Kerry had secretly been in talks with the Iranian government to salvage the nuclear deal after the Trump administration withdrew from it.

KERRY’S REBUTTAL: Trump's claim ""is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesman for Kerry told CNN in a statement. ""He's wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he's been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe,” said Matt Summers. “We'd hope the President would focus on solving foreign policy problems for America instead of attacking his predecessors for theater.”

‘NOBODY’S HAPPY’: President Trump said yesterday the United States is still assessing what message North Korea is trying to send by firing off short-range missiles for the second time in a week. But it seems clear Kim Jong Un is frustrated by the hardline stance of Trump’s negotiators, who are refusing any sanctions relief until Pyongyang shows it is serious about denuclearization.

“We're looking at it very seriously right now. They were smaller missiles, short-range missiles,” Trump said. “Nobody's happy about it, but we're taking a good look and we'll see. We'll see. The relationship continues, but we'll see what happens.”

“I know they want to negotiate. They're talking about negotiating. But I don't think they're ready to negotiate,” he added.

MAKING THINGS WORSE: “While this recent launch of short-range missiles does not violate Pyongyang’s promise to halt longer-range tests, North Korea has now made it clear it will not halt developing other parts of its military capabilities that threaten the region,” says Harry Kazianis, Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest.

Kim’s goal is quite clear, Kazianis argues, namely “to show America and its allies that if they aren’t willing to compromise on the terms of denuclearization that Pyongyang will indeed go its own way, with missile launches once again becoming the new norm and even longer-range tests like ICBM and nuclear weapons tests potentially coming by the summer.”

U.S. SEIZES N. KOREAN SHIP: The Justice Department announced yesterday that for the first time ever the United States has seized a North Korean cargo ship, alleging it violated international sanctions. “This sanctions-busting ship is now out of service,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement , which outlined what the Justice Department called “a scheme to export tons of high-grade coal to foreign buyers by concealing the origin of their ship, the ‘Wise Honest.’”

Maintenance for the ship, one of North Korea’s largest carriers, was paid for in U.S. dollars through unwitting U.S. banks. So far, there has been no reaction from Pyongyang.

CHARGED WITH LEAKING: A former intelligence analyst and Afghanistan veteran has been charged with leaking classified information to the media. Daniel Everett Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., was arrested on federal charges yesterday.

The recipient of the leak is not named in the indictment, but the charging document identifies him as Jeremy Scahill of the Intercept, an outspoken critic of America’s military activities overseas.

GUILTY OF SPYING: A former CIA case officer has pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to commit espionage on behalf of China. “I conspired to gather and send secret-level information to PRC, the government of PRC,” said Jerry Chun Shing Lee in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Lee, 54, served in the CIA for 13 years but left in 2007 and went to live in Hong Kong. In 2010, he was approached by two Chinese intelligence officers who offered to pay him a gift of $100,000 cash in exchange for national defense information Lee had acquired while at the CIA.

IT SLICES, IT DICES: The United States military and the CIA have been using a previously unknown missile variant designed to minimize unintended civilian casualties when targeting terrorists, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

The modified Hellfire missile, called the R9X, has been outfitted with two different payloads that do not explode. Instead, the missiles can carry 100 pounds of metal designed to cut through the tops of cars and buildings and ""a halo of six long blades"" that shred through anything in its path.

“The R9X is known colloquially to the small community of individuals who are familiar with its use as ‘the flying Ginsu,’ for the blades that can cut through buildings, car roofs or other targets. The nickname is a reference to the popular knives sold on TV infomercials in the late 1970s and early 1980s that showed them cutting through both tree branches and tomatoes,” the Journal report says.

The payloads were said to have been created in response to targets placing themselves among civilians so normal explosive ordnance could not be used without risking civilian casualties.

The Journal says it has confirmed the weapons killed Ahmad Hasan Abu Khayr al-Masr, al Qaeda’s second in command, in 2017 and, most recently, Jamal al-Badawi, who was accused of being behind the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole.

GOLD STAR RELIEF: A group of 29 senators has “introduced legislation to provide tax relief to the surviving spouses and children of military members killed in action,” according to a statement from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. The Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act is an attempt to correct an unintended consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which “inadvertently treats military and VA survivor benefits as trusts or estates, subjecting these benefits to a much higher tax rate.”

“The Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act effectively fixes this error by treating any military and VA survivor benefits as earned income, rather than at the trust or parent tax rate,” Warner’s statement says. Elaine Luria, D-Va., introduced companion legislation in the House last week.

LBJ’S PHONY VALOR: Last month’s christening of the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, the newest Zumwalt-class destroyer, brought to mind a now-mostly-forgotten story of how Johnson, who had a brief undistinguished naval career while serving in Congress, posed as a war hero by wearing a Silver Star lapel pin that he knew he didn’t rate.

In 2001, while working for CNN, I spent months exhaustively researching the story behind what famed Johnson biographer Robert Caro called “one of the most undeserved Silver Stars in history.”

In today’s social media age, anyone who wore a decoration for the third-highest military award for valor when in fact all he did was fly on a plane as a passenger, never encountering the enemy, would face ridicule and shame. But Johnson got away with it for decades and even bragged about his fictional bravery under fire.

If you don’t know the history of the lie behind Johnson’s phony valor , you can read about it in this week’s issue of the Washington Examiner magazine.

Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

W.Va. first responders oppose Homeland Security bill,https://www.wdtv.com,[],,,,https://www.wdtv.com/content/news/WVa-first-responders-oppose-Homeland-Security-bill-509797901.html,"West Virginia first responders have voted unanimously to oppose any legislation that would reorganize the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.

The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register reports the vote Friday from emergency management directors in all 55 counties in Moundsville was in anticipation of the introduction of a potential bill at an upcoming special legislative session. A similar bill died during the regular session earlier this year.

The plan would establish the Cabinet-level position of state resiliency officer under the state National Guard.

The division has operated under the National Guard's authority since Gov. Jim Justice's order in October. Justice said then the move would make the division more effective and efficient.

Some emergency managers say they are civilians and don't want to be working within a military presence.

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Read More: CIA Gives Tech Rivals Chance to Take on Amazon in Cloud Services

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
James Comey on DOJ inspector general's Trump-Russia investigation: 'Let's hear it',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-on-doj-inspector-generals-trump-russia-probe-lets-hear-it,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but ""if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it.""

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, exactly two years after he was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, Comey said no matter what is found by Horowitz's probe or by the investigation being conducted by Attorney General William Barr, ""they should be transparent about it.""

Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper told Comey that “the inspector general, the attorney general, they're now obviously looking into the origins of the investigation into the president and his campaign.” He asked Comey: “Are you confident you did everything by the book, and that the FBI, the people around you did everything by the book?”

[ Related: DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier]

Comey said he was confident that he, and the FBI more broadly, had done nothing wrong, replying, “Yes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn't mean I'm against review of it. That's totally fine.”

Cooper then pressed him further, asking, “So you think the inspector general will find nothing inappropriate?”

Comey said, “I don't think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.”

The Justice Department inspector general is looking into alleged FISA abuse related to surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The watchdog is also investigating the FBI’s reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier. That research was compiled at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier was a key part of FISA applications and renewals; Comey signed off on three of them.

[ Also read: Barr says 'multiple criminal leak investigations underway']

Cooper told Comey that “CNN has spoken to people within the FBI that say they have concerns that the inspector general could find something, and that they are bracing for what may be uncovered.”

Comey emphasized he looked forward to the results of the investigation and stressed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by himself or by the FBI. “Again, I'm a big believer in the truth. If the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it. I don't know of anything like that,"" he said.

Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during 2016 was criticized in a voluminous report released by Horowitz in June 2018, which Cooper reminded Comey of by saying that the Justice Department inspector general “called your decision not to inform the bosses about the Clinton press conference, they called it extraordinary, insubordinate.” Cooper further reminded him that “they also said your letter to Congress about reopening the Clinton emails investigation to the emails was based on your personal views even if it meant rejecting long-standing department policy or practice.”

Comey replied, “Yeah, that's fair criticism.”

Cooper then asked, “Is it true? Extraordinary and insubordinate and that it rejected long-standing policy practices?”

“Yes, except for the insubordinate part,” Comey contended.

Barr has said Horowitz’s Trump-Russia investigation into the actions of the Justice Department and FBI should be completed in either May or June."
"Schiff, Nunes send joint letter blasting DOJ for stonewalling on documents",https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-nunes-send-joint-letter-blasting-doj-for-stonewalling-on-documents,"The leaders of the House Intelligence Committee have threatened to issue a rare bipartisan subpoena that would compel the Justice Department to turn over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's complete and unredacted report on the Russia investigation, as well as allow Mueller himself to brief the committee about the probe.

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

DEMS WHO FUMED AT NUNES FOR JEOPARDIZING 'SOURCES AND METHODS' NOW DEMAND MUELLER REPORT IN FULL

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

"Trump's new plan to aid American farmers faces many hurdles, says ex-USDA chief",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Daniels'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/trumps-new-plan-to-aid-farmers-faces-many-hurdles-says-ex-usda-chief.html,"President Donald Trump Carlos Barria | Reuters

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Friday said President Donald Trump has directed his agency to work on a plan to help farmers impacted by the ongoing trade war with China. Perdue didn't offer further details on a possible plan but Trump via Twitter on Friday indicated that the U.S. could use some of the money from tariffs on Chinese goods to buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products from American farmers, or ""far more than China buys now."" The president also said U.S. agricultural products could be shopped ""to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.""

The Department of Agriculture declined to comment on plans it might have under consideration. However, a former USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, told CNBC that the administration has ""very limited options"" although it could some funds by tapping into the Commodity Credit Corp., a federal agency given authority during the Great Depression. ""The secretary's options are limited given the size of the challenge,"" said Vilsack, currently president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, a trade group. Vilsack also suggested the program may require congressional approval, although a trade mitigation plan the USDA unveiled last year for American farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs didn't require it. Vilsack added, ""They could do something. Whether they could do it to the extent that he's [Trump] suggested I think would require some congressional authorization and direction. I don't think there's enough flexibility in the USDA budget to be able to carve up and be able to identify $15 billion.""

Last July, Perdue unveiled a $12 billion trade aid program for American farmers that included trade promotion, food purchases, and direct payments to producers of soybeans, pork, corn, cotton, dairy and several other commodities. That earlier program utilized the CCC for so-called market facilitation payments to farmers, with the top five commodities being soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum. ""I think what the president was talking about was buying a bunch of soybeans,"" said Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served in the USDA during the Obama administration. ""And even if the secretary can identify the resources to purchase crops and products, getting them to countries requires a second step by USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] and the State Department."" Soybeans have been hard hit by Chinese tariffs, falling near 10-year lows on Monday amid the threat of an escalated trade war with China. Before the trade war, China was buying more than $12 billion worth of U.S. soybeans annually, or roughly 1 in 3 rows of soybeans grown on the nation's farms. Last year, China bought about $3.2 billion worth of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. But China last year imposed 25% tariffs on a variety of agricultural products including soybeans — a top commodity in many states where Trump received strong support during the 2016 presidential election. Trump's suggestion that the U.S. government buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are targeting the Midwest states for support. Meantime, Vilsack said it may be difficult for the administration to move quickly on the plan for other reasons. For one, he said some countries might not want to take the food commodities because it could have negative repercussions domestically. ""They would prefer to take cash because they don't want to disrupt their own agricultural economy by having foreign crops come in and displace domestically produced crops,"" he said.
