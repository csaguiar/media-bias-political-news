President Donald Trump predicted Friday there’s a “good chance” that congressional Democrats decide to work with him to pass his recently unveiled immigration plan before next year’s elections, despite every indication to the contrary.

“Will the Democrats give our Country a badly needed immigration win before the election?” he wrote online. “Good chance!”

Trump on Thursday unveiled his long-awaited plan to overhaul the immigration system, which proposes a merit-based system to admit more high-skilled, well-educated immigrants, rather than those who enter the U.S. based on family ties or because their native country has a low rate of immigration to the U.S. It would also include measures boosting security at the southern border similar to ones he has called for previously but includes no language concerning Dreamers, which Democrats have indicated would be necessary to garner their support.

Before the plan's release Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it “dead on arrival,” and the plan has received paltry support even from lawmakers of Trump’s own party.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal, saying Thursday he looked forward “to reviewing the president’s proposal.”

And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of Trump’s biggest Hill supporters, said the White House plan is “not designed to become law.”

Still, Trump appears eager to use the proposal as campaign issue heading into his reelection fight next year, attempting to paint Democrats as unwilling to cooperate to solve what they have acknowledged is a humanitarian crisis at the border.

At a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday to announce his blueprint, he suggested any lack of Democratic support was “possibly political.”

""If for some reason, possibly political, we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and of course, hold the presidency,"" Trump said. ""But wouldn't it be nice to do it sooner than that?""

He continued to drive that point Friday, tweeting, “the Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that, if we work together, it can be immediately fixed. We need Democrat votes and all will be well!

“Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border,” he added in a second tweet, claiming “many” migrants being detained were “bad hombres” and that those captured “are being detained & will be sent home.”

“Those which we release under the ridiculous Catch & Telease loophole, are being registered and will be removed later!” he wrote, misspelling ""release.""

Trump also tweeted a message to those in the country illegally: “All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed. Please do not make yourselves too comfortable, you will be leaving soon!”"

Rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran are also magnifying strains among President Donald Trump’s top foreign policy advisers: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton.

Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against the mullahs in Tehran has exacerbated fissures between the two men over the tight control Bolton has tried to exert over the national security decision-making process — and introduced new ones over the direction of U.S. policy.

Story Continued Below

Pompeo and his special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, have indicated that the administration’s goal in squeezing Iran is renewed negotiations with Iranian regime, according to two sources familiar with their thinking — something Trump has expressed a desire to do. But Bolton is a deep skeptic of the value of negotiating with adversaries who, before joining the White House, called publicly for regime change in Tehran.

While Pompeo has worked to carry out the president’s foreign policy directives, Bolton has done more to try to shape them — at times contradicting the president, as when he walked back Trump’s call for a rapid U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria.

Pompeo, 55, is widely seen as a loyalist to the president who rarely challenges Trump’s views. Some administration officials believe the former Kansas congressman, who recently flirted with a run for U.S. Senate, is exceedingly mindful of his own political future.

Bolton by contrast is capping a decades-long government career during which he has never hesitated to offer unpopular opinions — and is conscious that, at the age of 70, the position he holds as national security adviser is likely to be his last government post.

“Pompeo has demonstrated himself to be somebody who very much sees his job as realizing Trump’s vision for foreign policy, whatever that may be,” said David Rothkopf, a business consultant who has written books on the making of U.S. foreign policy.

In the case of Iran, U.S. officials say, their divergent approaches to working with the impulsive president has strained their relationship as the U.S. rattles a military saber at Tehran and the Iranians threaten to violate the 2015 nuclear deal struck with the Obama administration and five other nations.

Though Bolton and Pompeo largely have the same hawkish instincts, when disagreements have arisen, Bolton has made clear why he has a reputation as bare-knuckled bureaucratic infighter. He has placed the interagency national security process in a tight grip, aggressively shaping policy rather than acting as an impartial arbiter as many of his predecessors have done.

His predecessor, H.R. McMaster, was widely praised for the way he ran in the interagency process. Some officials, including Pompeo and former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, even complained that McMaster hosted too many meetings. On Bolton’s watch, those practices have gone by the wayside. The twice weekly 7:30 a.m. phone calls McMaster hosted to coordinate plans amongst senior national security officials stopped the day Bolton arrived at the White House.

A more informal process has since taken root, including a weekly breakfast attended by Bolton, Pompeo, and acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan.

One result is more centralized decision-making, which can leave Pompeo feeling excluded from a decision-making process he must later defend.

“Bolton is not very collaborative, he likes to do stuff himself. Pompeo is more collaborative by nature. And even if he weren’t inclined to be collaborative, he feels that he should be collaborated with because he’s the secretary of State,” said a former administration official who remains close to Pompeo.

Pompeo has specifically expressed irritation at Bolton’s use of Twitter to announce U.S. policy moves about which he has at times not been consulted about, said a senior administration official.

Bolton’s frequent tweeting is just one of several ways in which he has adopted an unusually visible profile more befitting a diplomat. While many national security advisers travel infrequently, he has made numerous foreign trips, including to Israel, Russia, Turkey, and Latin America.

Trump denied this week that there is “infighting” within his national security team. But days after Bolton released a strikingly bellicose statement threatening Iran with “unrelenting force,” Trump told reporters last week that he sometimes has to “temper” his senior aide’s “strong views.”

That same day, Pompeo issued a statement of his own that also threatened force, but ended on a markedly different note, citing Trump’s previous call for the Iranians to negotiate.

“As President Trump stated yesterday,” Pompeo wrote, “he ‘looks forward to someday meeting with leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves.’”

Allies of both men dismissed any disagreements between the two as the vanity of small differences.

“I think this is a debate between two Iran hawks that’s taking place between the 40-yard lines,” said Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who is close to senior Trump officials. “Any differences they have are tactical over the appropriate sequencing of maximum pressure measures and coercive diplomacy.”

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador Bolton and fully aligned on Iran policy,” said a State Department spokesman.

Further exacerbating the tension is a quiet campaign waged by Bolton’s team against Hook, Pompeo’s point man on Iran. Hook, backed by Pompeo, had sought to extend waivers granted by the Trump administration to eight countries allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran despite U.S. sanctions. That effort included outreach to friendly reporters with whispers that Hook was going weak on Iran and had landed on the wrong side of the debate — intended to shape the internal battle, in which Bolton ultimately prevailed. The State Department announced in early May that it would not grant additional waivers.

“At the president’s direction, Ambassador Bolton worked closely with departments and agencies to ensure the U.S. government brought Iran’s oil exports to zero,” said National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis.

Bolton and his allies say that he has not elbowed out his colleagues but reshaped the national security process to reflect Trump’s personal style. Bolton’s critics complain that he has largely phased out “principals committee” meetings, the forum for top Cabinet members to prepare and discuss policy options before presenting them to the president.

And he has also convened fewer formal in-depth meetings of the formal National Security Council with the president and more 15-minute Oval Office sessions where Bolton pulls in experts and advisers as he sees fit.

“You’ve got a national security adviser who doesn’t really want to have a process, he just wants to be the president’s chief adviser,” Rothkopf said.

That has frustrated Pompeo, who has joked about starting his own interagency, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the remark.

“The power of the national security adviser comes at the principals level, and the national security adviser controls access to the president,” said a senior administration official. “If you have lower-level meetings but very few Principals Committee meetings, then the final level is owned by the national security adviser.”"
What threatens democracy? Legendary Navy SEAL warns of Trump's attacks on US institutions,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Susan Page', 'Published A.M.

AUSTIN — Once the longest-serving Navy SEAL on active duty, Admiral William McRaven played a key role in thousands of dangerous missions abroad, including commanding the one that cost Osama bin Laden his life.

Now retired, McRaven warns that the greatest threat to American democracy he's seen during his decades in national security comes not from a rogue regime or a terrorist group but from the caustic rhetoric of President Donald Trump.

""An attack on the press or an attack on the Department of Justice, or to imply that there are dirty cops at the FBI or to ignore the intelligence community, I think, really undermines our institutions,"" McRaven told USA TODAY in an interview about his memoir, Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations, out Tuesday. ""And that makes me fearful of the future direction of the nation.""

McRaven: Trump's media attacks 'greatest threat to our democracy'

Five years after retiring as commander of U.S. Special Operations, McRaven retains the ramrod bearing and the reserve of a career officer with more than 37 years in uniform. In his new book, being published by Grand Central Publishing, he also reflects the military tradition of expressing nothing but regard for the presidents he served in top jobs, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

His account of daredevil missions — to intercept Somali pirates, free American missionaries held hostage in the Philippines, interrogate Saddam Hussein and recover long-frozen military remains in British Columbia — ends with his final salute in dress whites in 2014.

But in 2017, during a stint as chancellor of the University of Texas, McRaven began raising objections to Trump's attacks on the press in an address that also called on journalists to hold themselves accountable for accuracy and fairness. Last year, he wrote an open letter protesting the president's decision to revoke the security clearance of a frequent critic, former CIA director John Brennan, and asking that his own security clearance be revoked as well.

That brought a rebuke from the president — he dismissed McRaven as a ""Hillary Clinton fan"" who should have caught bin Laden faster — and blowback from some of his former military colleagues, who argued it was inappropriate for him to publicly criticize the commander in chief.

""It has been an unwritten rule that senior military officers don't come out against the president, and I think that's a good unwritten rule,"" McRaven said. ""But I've got to look myself in the mirror and make sure I'm doing what I think is the right thing.""

His concerns about Trump's attacks on democratic institutions have only deepened, he said, noting the president's increasingly defiant response to congressional investigations.

""When the lawmakers of this nation ask for a person to testify or ask for certain documents, I think sooner or later, the White House needs to comply, as does the military or anybody else that's being subpoenaed to provide information,"" he said.

At stake, in his view, is faith in the foundations of democracy.

""If the American people feel like they can't trust those institutions, then what do they turn to?"" he asked. ""Our institutions really have got to be able to survive whoever's in the White House.""

He said he doesn't plan to play a role in the 2020 presidential campaign but added that he's ""learned never to say 'never.'""

Climbing the walls

When the Navy SEALS were established in 1962, McRaven was 6 years old and to all appearances already in training for the special operations force.

His father was a Spitfire combat pilot in World War II who was then assigned to the military arm of NATO, based in France. The youngster would terrify his older sister by scaling from window to window on the outside of their three-story chateau, or by climbing down the well in the backyard. When their father was assigned to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, McRaven became a regular visitor to the Wilford Hall Air Force Hospital emergency room to have gashes stitched up and broken bones set in the aftermath of adventures.

At the University of Texas, he graduated with a bachelors degree from the journalism school, but only because he saw the subject as easier to ace than his previous majors, in pre-med and then accounting, where his grades were so borderline that they might have made it difficult for him to get the Navy commission he wanted.

He joined the elite SEALS (an abbreviation for Sea, Air and Land teams), was pushed out of SEAL Team Six when he complained about a lack of military discipline, then thrived. He would hold command at every level. Finally, in 2011, he designed and executed the special-ops raid in Pakistan that led to the death of bin Laden a decade after the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington.

Osama bin Laden's son: Hamza emerging as new al-Qaeda leader

In some ways, he said, the experiences of his long career seemed to be in preparation for Operation Neptune's Spear.

""I was at the top of my game,"" he said, having run Special Operations longer than anyone else. ""I had seen thousands of missions. I knew the personalities of the people involved. I knew how to do this mission. I knew how to command this mission, because my life had brought me to that point."" The mission succeeded even though one of the stealth helicopters crash-landed during the assault and had to be abandoned.

When the other Black Hawk helicopter carrying the body of the man they believed to be bin Laden returned to the Jalalabad airfield in Afghanistan, McRaven went to the hangar to confirm his identify. He unzipped the rubberized bag, pulled out the body and stretched it to its full length. He looked like bin Laden, but McRaven wanted to double-check before he informed President Obama.

""Son, how tall are you?"" he asked one of the SEALS, who told him he was 6'2"". ""Good,"" McRaven said. ""Lie down next to the body."" Bin Laden was reported to be 6'4"", and unorthodox way of measuring the corpse indicated it was him.

In the office of his home, in a leafy area of Austin, McRaven has a plaque that Obama presented him a few days later. On it is mounted a bright yellow 25-foot metal tape measure. ""If we can afford a $60 million helicopter,"" the inscription reads, ""I think we can afford a tape measure.""

'Which time was that?'

McRaven already is a best-selling author. His 2014 commencement address detailing 10 principles he followed as a Navy SEAL was published in 2017 as a self-help volume titled Make Your Bed. (The title of Chapter One: ""Start Your Day with a Task Completed."") It has sold more than a million copies.

He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2010, when he was on duty in Afghanistan. He managed the symptoms of the blood cancer for years but hit ""a perfect storm of bad health"" in 2017 that forced him to retire as chancellor of the University of Texas the next spring. Exposure to Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals has been tied to the disease.

""I've been exposed to so many things over the course of my career,"" McRaven, now 63, said. ""I used to dive under nuclear submarines and nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. You're diving in waters that are hardly crystal-clear.""

But he expressed no regrets. ""I wouldn't change it for anything.""

It was dangerous duty from the start.

Asked in the USA TODAY interview to describe more details about ""that time when you were sure you were going to die,"" McRaven replied, brow furrowed, ""Which time was that?""

No one in American politics understands the dark art of ridicule better than Donald Trump. (“Welcome to the race, Sleepy Joe.”) And when it comes to seeing himself on the receiving end, nobody in American politics has a thinner skin. His fury at President Barack Obama’s roasting of him at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner may have motivated his own run for the presidency. More recently, his sensitivity to ridicule has been on sharp display in his seething reaction to Alec Baldwin’s running impression over the past three years on “Saturday Night Live.”

Baldwin has carved out a late-career niche as the nation’s highest-profile interpreter of Trump. For most viewers, his performance, all preening and bluster, has settled into comedy-staple territory. And for most presidents, rolling with SNL’s punches is just another part of the job. Neither is true for this particular viewer-in-chief. The performance gets further under Trump’s skin with each passing season.

Story Continued Below

“Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!” he tweeted on October 16, 2016, three weeks before winning the election. By early 2018, safely ensconced in the White House, Trump was still taking it personally: “Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch.”

This year, Trump was back decrying the unfairness of it all, to the point of calling for an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission. “Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution.”

The SNL season wraps up on Saturday, with many fans wondering whether Baldwin will make an appearance. His sketches are by now guaranteed crowd-pleasers, expertly crafted portraits of the inner boob behind the blowhard. They’re eye and ear candy for the mostly liberal urban sophisticates at whom the show is aimed. But if those viewers think they’re watching an evisceration of Trump, they should look more closely at what the sketches are really saying about their nemesis. And while it’s certainly within the president’s rights to refuse to laugh along, he’s dead wrong in suggesting that Baldwin’s portrayal is politically damaging. In fact, it may be one of the best things he has going for him.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2484/1155968404_6037800732001_6037799162001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The sheer relentlessness of Trump’s disdain suggests that Baldwin’s impersonation must go beyond satire into something more subversive—that the 61-year-old actor is spewing poisonous propaganda against a duly elected leader. But to look back over the full Baldwin/Trump oeuvre since 2016 is to realize just how tame it is—and, in an important way, what a favor it does the president. Baldwin’s Trump bears a closer resemblance to the befuddled governor on the old “Benson” sitcom than it does “Dr. Strangelove” or “The Manchurian Candidate” or any other of the darker historical figures to whom he’s been compared. In Baldwin’s hands he’s foolish and self-deluded, all right, but he also sometimes seems abashed by the reactions he provokes and the trouble he accidentally stirs up. (“It’s awful. Everything’s falling apart. Sometimes I wish I had never been president,” he moans at the start of an “It’s a Wonderful Life” parody; “All alone again. No one understands me,” he sighs in a skit on his trip to South America.)

By giving Trump qualities he’s shown little evidence of in public—conscience, introspection, even regret— “SNL” does him an enormous favor. It offers a glimmer of sympathy about his motives, inviting the generous assumption that there’s a better and more self-aware man lurking behind the Twitter feed. In portraying the president as a beleaguered figure, it even allows the conclusion that the real threat to democracy isn’t Trump’s venomous rhetoric or disregard for constitutional norms, but the ruthlessness of the Washington system that confronts this blustering, fumbling uncle.

Now, as House Democrats debate the level of the president’s culpability for a series of actions that might reasonably appear to be attempts to obstruct justice, the “SNL” skits seem like grounds for exculpation. In the wake of the Mueller report, politicians, along with average Americans, are struggling to separate two competing notions of Trump—the fast-talking interloper who just got in over his head on some legal stuff, and Trump the deliberate lawbreaker. For instance, when the new president asked Chris Christie to tell then-FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, how much he liked him and considered him “part of the team,” did he know—as Christie, a former U.S. attorney, immediately did—that the request was inappropriate?

Baldwin’s characterization, as harshly as it may be intended by the actor and the writers who shape it, offers up an answer to that kind of question: No, of course, he had no idea. It’s a picture of the president as an uncomprehending naif. In the high-stakes argument about his fitness for the presidency, it amounts to an exhibit for the defense. Perhaps Trump should be thanking Baldwin, not threatening him.

The hidden influence of this kind of comedy, the widely seen late-night material that ends up as YouTube clips and watercooler fodder, lies in its ability to shape a narrative outside the news, interpreting people’s motives rather than just character. The comedian professes to peel off coats of varnish and reveal an essential but hidden truth. Often that truth is anodyne but amusing, and becomes an instant trope—a predictable laugh line, like Bill Clinton’s lustfulness. Baldwin’s vain but incompetent Trump is well within this tradition, with the audience chuckling along with his every ego-shattering overreach. But the long history of late-night comedy, especially the 44 years of “SNL,” shows that sometimes these comedy missiles really do land on the target. That’s the charge that Trump is leveling against Baldwin and “SNL.” He’s right about the power of late-night hit jobs. He’s just wrong in pitching himself as a victim.



***

Like many great satirical portrayals, Baldwin’s Trump is built around a single mannerism that isn’t so much copied from life as interpreted to express an inner truth. When this Trump messes up, his lips turn into a stupefied O. This gesture of surprise—the signature of Baldwin’s portrayal, which draws the biggest guffaws—usually comes when Baldwin/Trump does something impetuous (such as naming Kanye West his new strategist) or merely embarrassing (picking up a phone and finding Stormy Daniels on the line).

The narrative that emerges from three years of Baldwin’s Trump skits is that of an overeager salesman who gets swept up by a political wave he can’t control and washes ashore at the White House, the unintended victim of his own stunt. There he is, armed with nothing but his reserve tank of bluster and bravado, trying to brave his way through a job for which he is manifestly unprepared.

Like the subgenre of political movies in which average guys accidentally end up president, typified by “Dave,” the Trump sketches on “SNL” are essentially fish-out-of-water comedies. The humor comes from watching the imposter fake his way through the White House obstacle course. That may not be entirely flattering to Trump, but it is closer to his own view of his situation—which he once described as “surreal”—than to that of his most worried critics. For the jokes to work, the audience has to sympathize, at least a little, with his predicament.

For a franchise built on having an edge, especially when it comes to culture and politics, it might feel like “SNL” has gone soft. But despite its reputation for pushing boundaries, earned mostly in its early, pathbreaking days, “SNL” has only rarely been a source of political blasphemy. When it comes to public figures, it draws more giggles than gasps.

Over its four-plus decades, the show has cut down eight presidents (nine, if you count its early retrospective Nixon skits) and dozens of candidates, all without drawing much electoral blood. Its skits about Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were built around great comic turns by Darrell Hammond and Will Ferrell, but otherwise tracked closely to other late-night depictions of Clinton as louche and Bush as a dim-witted cowboy; “SNL” only added to the archetypes. That was better than it fared during the eight-year presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, who were their own archetypes. The show failed to produce consistently funny portraits, striking pure comedy gold only once in those years, in the late Phil Hartman’s memorable “Reagan Mastermind” sketch at the height of the Iran-Contra era. The joke then, unlike today, was that the president might actually be a master of self-control.

Dana Carvey’s memorably wacky, way-out-there take of George H.W. Bush remains a milestone of comic impersonation, though it’s arguable whether it had any political impact; the same with Dan Aykroyd’s know-it-all Jimmy Carter.

In retrospect, the show’s most politically lethal presidential portrait was its very first. When what was then known as “NBC’s Saturday Night” went on the air in October 1975, Gerald Ford had been in the White House a little more than a year, and America still wasn’t sure what it had gotten in its first unelected president. The amiable Ford arrived with a barrel full of goodwill from his decades as a popular House leader, but struggled to project himself on a broader stage. “Saturday Night” filled in the gaps. A former college football player (at the University of Michigan, no less), Ford was one of the country’s most athletic chief executives. Assuming the presidency at 61, he spent his vacations slaloming down the slopes of Vail rather than sipping wine on Martha’s Vineyard. But one of those ski trips included a rather mundane spill caught on camera, which combined with another slip when he carried his own umbrella down the rain-soaked steps of Air Force One to make a trend.

Enter Chevy Chase, the floppy-haired, insouciant writer and sketch comedian who became the show’s first star. He started interpolating falls in which the president tumbles within an inch of his life only to emerge with his chin high, his expression a Peter Sellers-like deadpan. Pretty soon, the show’s opening act every week was Ford falling down, and Chase began enacting other made-up gestures of presidential clumsiness, like hearing a phone ring and putting a full water glass to his ear. The message sank in: The unelected president was truly an accidental president.

Ford never quite survived that depiction; Chevy Chase’s falls cut him down to size, emphasizing his ordinariness. They became the physical expression of his illegitimacy and lack of charisma. When Ford lost the 1976 election by 2 percentage points, one could argue that “SNL”’s role in shaping his image had really hurt him.

Nonetheless, the good-natured Ford praised Chase and even appeared briefly on the show, thereby cementing his nice-guy reputation. In so doing, he started a trend in which the targets of “SNL” skits gritted their teeth and pretended to play along with the joke. George H.W. Bush invited Carvey to perform for his White House staff; in characteristic Bush fashion, a friendship ensued that lasted 25 years.

No doubt someone told the stories about Ford and George H.W. Bush to Sarah Palin, the subject of an epic impersonation by Tina Fey that was both as inspired as Carvey’s Bush and as devastating as Chase’s Ford. The real-life Alaskan governor and 2008 vice presidential candidate appeared on the show, looking like she’d rather be elsewhere, and offered a few uneasy one-liners, but the good-sport vibe didn’t carry over: Viewers kept laughing at her, not with her.

Palin’s flop didn’t deter the Hillary Clinton of 2016 from trying her own version of the Ford approach for dealing with “SNL,” appearing as a world-weary bartender while Kate McKinnon, playing Clinton, soaked up her advice. It was a funny moment, and the real Clinton looked reassuringly human standing behind a bar and calling herself Val. But like a dash of spritzer in a very dry wine, it barely reduced the acidity of McKinnon’s years of skits mocking Clinton as power-hungry and insincere. In interviews, McKinnon has expressed her admiration for Clinton, and no one doubts her sincerity. But McKinnon happens to be the most unsparing of caricature artists, a sketch-comedy assassin. Just ask Kellyanne Conway, Jeff Sessions, Lindsey Graham or many other targets of her image-shaping lacerations.

Trump may have been the one grumbling, but Clinton was on the losing end of 2016’s “SNL” primary. A transparently phony, cackling laugh; a finger wave that managed to be both withholding and condescending; an unquenchable thirst for power that provided the undercurrent for almost every skit: This was the Clinton-from-hell of voters’ nightmares, just plausible enough to settle over the campaign like an indictment. (If you aren’t convinced, just compare with the far more flattering, earnest Clinton portrayed by Amy Poehler during her 2008 run.) Yes, McKinnon’s Clinton was better-informed and far, far smarter than Trump—that was the rub, however. Where was her moral core? McKinnon provided an answer: ruthless ambition.

Like Chevy Chase and Tina Fey, Kate McKinnon is a writer as well as a performer, and her characterizations seem to come from somewhere outside her own persona: They’re like a few devastating paragraphs in a satirical novel. Alec Baldwin followed a different path to fame. He was a cinematic leading man who grew into a character actor. He learned in the proving ground of situation comedy how to show glimpses of humanity in otherwise objectionable figures—thus securing at least a winking share of the audience’s affection. That put Trump in the hands of a gentler satirist.

Despite his well-known aversion to the president—he has said it pains him to play Trump, and has described the president as a con man, a stooge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and worse—Baldwin unconsciously allows some of himself to spill over into his Trump. When Baldwin’s Trump listens to a barely coherent ramble from Kanye West in a sketch from late last year, he is in on the joke. “Oooh, this guy might be cuckoo,” he says to himself, in one of Baldwin’s verbal thought bubbles. He compares West to Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un (“and they made a lot more sense than him”) before musing, “He doesn’t stop. He doesn’t listen to anyone but himself. Who does he remind me of? Oh my God, he’s black me!”

If these types of self-aware interior monologues serve a humanizing function, warming up Trump’s image, why is he complaining? One reason is, of course, Trump’s renegade populism, which requires enemies. Trump has to appear as the victim of powerful elites in order to define himself by what he’s up against. His assault on Baldwin and “SNL” is of a piece with his similar rants against Jim Acosta and CNN.

There’s also vanity. Attacks on Trump’s competence and intelligence land on sore spots. For a candidate who scores his best numbers, by far, among the demographic that never attended college, he’s surprisingly quick to assert his Ivy League bona fides. He even ordered Michael Cohen to keep his educational transcripts under wraps, lest any bad grades from half a century ago find their way into the media.

These two possible explanations for Trump’s attacks on Baldwin frame the key question of his presidency, the one people are grappling with in post-Mueller Washington: Is Trump calculating, or is he improvising?

Trump-the-calculator presumably knew that his out-of-the-box praise for Putin during the 2016 campaign would increase his chances of a lucrative score with Trump Tower Moscow, using one of the sacred rituals of American democracy for his business advantage. Trump-the-improviser was just faking his way through, letting politics and business become intertwined mostly because he was acting on instinct and didn’t know the guardrails.

What appears to be authenticity is one of Trump’s greatest electoral calling cards, and Republicans tend to take it at face value. He’s an amateur in a professional game, and that explains why he sometimes breaks the rules. There’s a kind of everyman logic behind his actions, and his supporters want him to shake up the system. Despite their antipathy toward him, there are many Democrats who assess him on similar terms. In their eyes, Trump is woefully, agonizingly, even dangerously unqualified for the presidency, but he’s not fundamentally ill-intentioned, except perhaps in some of his prejudices. This may seem to them like a devastating judgment, which is embedded in Baldwin’s portrayal on “SNL.”

But there are, of course, much harsher assessments of Trump. One, suggested by the Mueller report, is of a man who willfully used the tools of his office for his personal benefit, who demanded illegal and unethical acts from his subordinates, threatened them and tried to replace them when they refused to go along and shredded legal and political norms in the process. In trying to save himself, that version of Trump isn’t some rogue elephant acting on instinct, but a narcissist who puts his own interests ahead of the country’s. There is, presumably, no twinkle in Trump’s eye when he orders his Treasury secretary to refuse a congressional subpoena of his tax records, no sharp intake of breath when he invokes executive privilege to shield an investigation into his own campaign. His mouth doesn’t twist into a petrified O when he maligns Robert Mueller or calls on Republican appointees of the Supreme Court to protect him.

This Trump isn’t the stuff of caricature, or the hapless figure of fun portrayed on “SNL.” He’s the one who shows up on TV nearly every day, president of the United States despite the disdain of all those knowing elites, bending Washington to his will."
Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."
"Investigators Urge E.P.A. to Pursue Scott Pruitt for $124,000 in ‘Excessive’ Travel Costs",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/climate/scott-pruitt-epa-travel-expenses.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — Federal investigators concluded in a report Thursday that Scott Pruitt had spent nearly $124,000 on “excessive” travel arrangements as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and recommended that the agency try to recover the money.

The report, issued by the E.P.A.’s inspector general, brings to a close a nearly two-year investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s travel. It found that 40 trips or planned trips that were later canceled during 10 months starting in March 2017, the time frame of the investigation, had cost taxpayers a total of more than $985,000.

About 82 percent of that was for first-class and business-class airfare, and 16 of the trips involved stops in Tulsa, Okla., where Mr. Pruitt owned a home. The expenses also included a $629-per-night hotel room in Italy. Many of the trips were approved by agency officials retroactively after Mr. Pruitt’s travel.

Of the total cost, inspectors concluded that $123,942 had been spent “without sufficient justification and, initially, without appropriate approval authority.”"

Democrats are examining options for their next steps. But both sides agree the matter is headed to the courts.

All indications are that Treasury and the IRS won’t provide the requested documents, since Mnuchin already rejected Neal’s requests for the returns made in letters that cited Section 6103 of the federal tax code. Mnuchin said Wednesday that he expects Treasury to provide some type of response by the deadline and that “you can guess which way we’re leaning on our subpoena.”

Neal has long said that he expects the dispute over Trump’s tax returns to result in a court case, and Mnuchin also said Wednesday that he thinks the issue will end up in the courts. Those closely following the issue expect that Democrats will pursue a lawsuit to enforce their subpoenas and Section 6103.

A court case could be lengthy, but legal experts say it could be effective in achieving Democrats’ goal of obtaining Trump’s returns.

In order to pressure Treasury and the IRS to comply with their request, Democrats “need leverage from an outside source that they don’t have right now,” said University of Pittsburgh law professor Philip Hackney.

It’s not certain exactly what the process for Democrats to bring a lawsuit would look like, but they would be expected to get authorization.

Legal experts say that there have been questions about whether the full House would need to vote to authorize a lawsuit, or whether the House’s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) could do so. The experts say that it would be best for the House to vote to authorize a lawsuit, since it’s unclear whether House rules allow the BLAG to authorize lawsuits to enforce subpoenas.

“I would imagine that if they try to do that, there would be protests from the minority and appeals to the parliamentarian,” Mike Stern, a former senior counsel in the House counsel’s office, said of using the BLAG.

In addition to filing a lawsuit, there have been growing calls for action to be taken against Mnuchin if he doesn’t comply with the subpoena.

Ryan Thomas, spokesman for the progressive group Stand Up America, said he hopes Democrats start contempt proceedings against Mnuchin on top of filing a lawsuit. He said that contempt proceedings would help to ensure that the public knows that Mnuchin didn’t comply with the demands for Trump’s tax returns.

“Creating additional visibility I think is important,” he said.

The House could vote to refer a criminal contempt citation against Mnuchin to the Justice Department, but the department would be unlikely to prosecute him. House Democrats could also try to impeach Mnuchin, but the GOP-controlled Senate would be unlikely to vote to convict him.

Neal told reporters last week that holding Mnuchin or Rettig in contempt hadn’t been discussed.

Another option would be for Congress to use its inherent contempt authority to detain or fine Mnuchin until he complies with the subpoena for Trump’s tax returns.

When asked Thursday about using inherent contempt to fine people who are defying subpoenas, Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiGrateful Dead drummer: 'Nature's rhythm is dying because we're killing the Earth' Overnight Defense: Congressional leaders receive classified briefing on Iran | Trump on war: 'I hope not' | Key Republican calls threats credible | Warren plan targets corporate influence at Pentagon The Memo: Trump's new immigration plan finds few friends MORE (D-Calif.) said that “nothing is off the table” but did not say that the House was planning it.

University of Southern California law professors Samuel Erman and Edward Kleinbard suggested in a Washington Post op-ed this week that Congress use its inherent powers in order to put the burden on seeking court action on the administration rather than on Congress.

“Congress should not be required to go cap in hand to go to the judicial system,” Kleinbard told The Hill.

But some don’t think Democrats will ultimately pursue inherent contempt since Congress hasn’t pursued it in years.

“I don’t see the IRS commissioner or Secretary Mnuchin in jail,” said University of Iowa professor Andy Grewal.

Democrats could also obtain some of Trump’s tax documents if the state of New York enacts a law that allows the chairmen of Congress’s tax committees to request state tax returns from New York’s commissioner of taxation and finance. The state senate passed the bill last week, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) backs it.

University of Chicago law professor Daniel Hemel called the New York bill “an ace in the hole” for Democrats.

He said the documents that could be turned over to New York wouldn’t tell Democrats everything they want to know about Trump’s taxes, but would tell them if Trump has reported an adjusted gross income of zero in recent years. A New York Times story published earlier this month found that Trump’s large business losses from 1985 to 1994 meant that he only paid income taxes in two of those years.

The New York returns would show “whether there are any real whoppers,” Hemel said.

Neal may opt against seeking Trump’s state tax returns if the bill allowing him to request them becomes law. Neal’s stated purpose for requesting Trump’s federal returns focuses on interest in oversight about the IRS’s audits of sitting presidents.

“Our request is in furtherance of the committee’s investigation into the mandatory presidential audit program and to decide whether that program needs to be codified into federal law,” Neal spokesman Dan Rubin said. “This is part of our oversight over the IRS. State returns from NY would not help that investigation.”

Many of Democrats’ options are not mutually exclusive, and they could take multiple approaches in their effort to obtain Trump’s tax returns.

Recent polling from Morning Consult and Politico found that about half of registered voters support Democrats’ efforts, with responses divided along party lines.

Some see a fight over Trump’s tax returns as a political winner for Democrats, particularly those in predominantly Democratic districts.

“For Chairman Neal, there are only political pros to filing a lawsuit,” Hemel said, adding that if you are a House Democrat who stands in the way of the public seeing Trump’s tax returns, “that’s an uncomfortable place to be in.”

But others suggested that Democrats would be better-served if they focused more on policy matters such as middle-class tax cuts, rather than Trump’s tax returns.

Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said that Trump tends not to be hurt by the various scandals associated with him.

“I think it’s time for Democrats to focus on issues,” he said."
CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
Rod Rosenstein’s replacement has officially been confirmed by the Senate,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/16/18626754/jeffrey-rosen-bill-barr-confirmation-deputy-attorney-general-mueller-report,"Jeffrey Rosen, an attorney who’s never served at the Department of Justice or as a prosecutor, just became Attorney General William Barr’s second-in-command.

Rosen was most recently deputy secretary at the Transportation Department, and while he’s not the first to take on this role with little DOJ background, he was widely panned by Democrats for his inexperience at the agency. Given solid backing from Republicans, however, he was confirmed by the Senate 52-45 in a vote on Thursday.

Rosen joins the DOJ as deputy attorney general at a time of immense change. Rod Rosenstein vacated the role in early May, and special counsel Robert Mueller is set to leave the agency shortly as well, now that his probe into Russian election interference is complete.

Mueller’s review may be over, but the fallout from it is just beginning — and that will likely be a key issue Rosen will have to deal with in this role, which also includes overseeing the day-to-day operations of “107,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $28 billion,” according to a Politico report by former DOJ career attorney Julie Rodin Zebrak.

Already, Democrats have pushed for an unredacted version of the report and testimony from Mueller himself, while Republicans are urging the DOJ to conduct other reviews about bias against the Trump campaign. Rosen’s predecessor, Rosenstein, was ultimately pivotal to ensuring that the Mueller investigation was able to continue.

Rosen will report directly to Barr, someone he worked alongside previously at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Barr previously offered a hearty endorsement of Rosen’s nomination, praising his “more than 35 years’ experience litigating complex matters in state and federal courts across the country” earlier this year.

Who is Jeffrey Rosen?

Rosen has split his more than three-decade career between jobs in the government and stints at Kirkland & Ellis. According to his biography on the Transportation Department website, Rosen served as general counsel for the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Transportation Department between 2003 and 2009, under President George W. Bush. He had also worked at Kirkland & Ellis for almost three decades, including for clients like General Motors and Hyundai.

Rosen was confirmed for the deputy transportation secretary position 56-42 in May 2017, with predominantly Republican support.

According to Politico, Democrats’ primary concerns about his appointment to that role centered on Rosen’s approach to environmental policy. And some of these certainly proved warranted: While at the Transportation Department, Rosen has undone prior regulations established during President Barack Obama’s administration and helped roll back rules on fuel efficiency.

Rosen, during his April confirmation hearing, was also pressed on how he would handle the job at the Justice Department, including questions about his stance on releasing the full Mueller report. Rosen wouldn’t commit to sharing the entire report, though he did say he would support federal investigations that may be generated from it to continue. “If I’m confirmed, I would expect in all criminal investigations and prosecutorial matters that they proceed on the facts and the law,” he said.

Additionally, Rosen emphasized that he’d push back on potential political pressure from the White House around Justice Department activities, when needed. “If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no,” he noted.

The deputy attorney general is responsible for the day-to-day functions of the agency

The deputy attorney general’s job, which has historically been a relatively low-profile one, also includes an expansive set of responsibilities, Rodin Zebrak writes. And because Rosen hasn’t worked at the Justice Department before, a lot of these could prove entirely new to him:

The deputy attorney general oversees day-to-day operations and policies of the entire DOJ, a sprawling institution of more than 107,000 employees and an annual budget of approximately $28 billion. The department includes the litigating divisions such as the Civil Rights Division, Criminal Division, Antitrust Division, National Security Division, Civil Division, and the Environmental and Natural Resources Division. The deputy supervises all 93 United States attorneys and their work around the country, as well as immigration judges. DOJ also includes the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, United States Marshals Service and Bureau of Prisons. For someone completely new to DOJ, managing all that will require a steep learning curve.

Rosen was confronted with this question at his confirmation hearing, during which he emphasized his experience overseeing more than 55,000 employees at DOT and his lengthy legal career.

He’ll be joining the agency at a time of major scrutiny related to the Mueller investigation, blowback to Trump’s immigration policies, and looming questions about antitrust enforcement. Now that he’s been confirmed, he’ll have the opportunity to prove that he can handle it."
Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""
Treasury Official Hired to Fix Fannie and Freddie Is Leaving,https://www.nytimes.com,['Emily Flitter'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/business/craig-phillips-treasury-fannie-mae-freddie-mac.html,"Investors snapped up Fannie’s and Freddie’s shares in anticipation. One of the big bettors was the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, run by William A. Ackman, which first took a position in the shares in 2013. The fund held 116 million Fannie shares at the end of March, according to securities filings compiled by FactSet, a data provider. That position would currently be worth more than $300 million.

Shares of both Fannie and Freddie have more than doubled this year, although they are still far below their pre-crisis levels.

But overhauling Fannie and Freddie has proved to be a complicated and politically thorny endeavor. The Obama administration tried and failed. Congress is deeply divided on the issue, which has the potential to affect the lives and finances of tens of millions of Americans.

Trump administration officials have been trying to jump-start the overhaul efforts this year, but with limited results.

Mr. Phillips and other Treasury officials have been meeting with the biggest American banks to determine how best to raise capital for Fannie and Freddie — a prerequisite to releasing them from government control — as well as how the housing finance system might be restructured, according to two people who participated in the meetings.

Mark Calabria, the recently confirmed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, said in a speech this week that he had the power to release the companies back into the private sector. But, he said, Congress would need to act to make such a plan viable by empowering the agency to better regulate the privatized companies.

Mr. Phillips is not the only confidant of Mr. Mnuchin on his way out. The Treasury’s assistant secretary for international markets, Heath Tarbert, has been nominated to be chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will leave if confirmed by the Senate. And Eli Miller, who was Mr. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, left in April to join the private equity firm Blackstone."

Schiff told reporters that the committee has “reluctantly scheduled” a business meeting next week to take an ""enforcement action"" to compel the Justice Department to turn over the files –– but he offered no details on what that action would be.

“We gave them a reasonable period of time to produce them and ask them to do so as a demonstration of good faith, and an initial part of what would be a rolling production of documents. The long and the short of it is, the deadline came and went without the production of a single document, raising profound questions about whether the department has any intention to honor its legal obligations,” Schiff said.

“So we are reluctantly scheduling a committee business meeting for next week, where we plan to take up an enforcement action,” Schiff said.

The Democratic chairman issued a subpoena for Mueller’s unredacted report, underlying evidence, and the counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials generated in the course of the Russia investigation last week. Schiff set a 3 p.m. deadline Wednesday for the Justice Department to comply.

A spokesman for the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment on Schiff’s remarks.

The chairman said the committee will defer to the House counsel to decide what their best course of action is to enforce the subpoena, a matter being examined across multiple House committees grappling with how to compel the White House to cooperate with Democrats’ multiple oversight investigations.

“We will continue to urge the Department to render that unnecessary but if they don't demonstrate some good faith, we will be forced to compel them to honor their legal commitments,” Schiff said.

Schiff noted that despite asking for a “narrow” set of documents, the Justice Department’s response to their request was “largely unresponsive,” though the chairman declined to share their back-and-forth communication.

The House Judiciary Committee has similarly subpoenaed for Mueller’s full, unredacted report and underlying evidence. The Justice Department has resisted the panel’s requests, saying that turning over Mueller’s full report -- including grand jury material -- would amount to violating the law and compromising ongoing investigations.

The Judiciary panel voted to hold Barr in contempt last week for failing to comply with the subpoena. The resolution has not yet reached the floor for a vote by the full House.

Schiff has noted that his panel’s request for the files is distinct from that of the Judiciary Committee, arguing his committee is entitled to the foreign and counterintelligence information as a result of its oversight of the intelligence community.

Schiff, who issued the subpoena last Wednesday, accused the Justice Department of failing to negotiate with the committee or comply with its bipartisan requests for Mueller’s report and other files over the past several weeks.

"Amid US-China trade war, Americans need to know who they're dealing with",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/amid-us-china-trade-war-americans-need-to-know-who-theyre-dealing-with,"President Trump is not backing down in his trade war. After initially raising tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of goods coming from China, the Trump administration also hiked tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of goods.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said: ""We're having a little squabble with China because we've been treated very unfairly for many, many decades or actually a long time, and it should've been handled a long time ago, and it wasn't, and we'll handle it now. I think it's going to turn out extremely well. We're in a very strong position.""

The additional tariffs come after China announced it will raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods coming from the United States. Trump is excited about this escalating trade war. Others in Washington are not.

Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, both Republicans, have expressed concern and pessimism over Trump’s trade policy, especially when it comes to agriculture. The state they both represent, Iowa, ranks second in the nation in terms of agricultural exports between corn, soybeans, pork, and eggs. It’s also the nation’s leader in producing and exporting corn and ethanol, a biofuel additive for gasoline.

Meanwhile, the 2020 Democratic candidates are pinning all the blame on Trump.

Following the news of the initial tariffs being raised, Joe Biden told reporters in New Hampshire this week, ""The president has done nothing but increase the tariffs, the debt, and the trade deficit. The way we have to proceed is we have to have our allies with us. It’s not just us. We have to keep the world together.” Earlier in May, Biden said that China are not bad folks and are not competition for the U.S.

The problem here is that many Democrats, like Biden, are pretending there's a moral equivalence between China and the U.S.

China is an authoritarian state run by the Communist Party. The Chinese people simply don’t have the same freedoms as Americans. Political dissent is punished. Freedom of religion is a farce.

Consider the Uighur Muslims, a religious and ethnic minority in the western province of Xinjiang, who have been persecuted by the Chinese government for practicing Islam. In addition to being subject to increased surveillance in daily life that includes owning books about Uighurs, growing a beard, having a prayer rug, or even quitting smoking or drinking, over a million Uighur Muslims are imprisoned in “re-education camps,” which can be argued as modern-day concentration camps.

Looking at the bigger picture, Trump’s trade war could be the extent of how far he’s willing to go with China. Yes, U.S. farmers and consumers will arguably be hurt by the tariffs. But China is a bad actor that has no interest in making the lives of Americans better. All they care about is expanding and cementing their power on the world stage. American politicians on both sides of the aisle should be quick to remember that."
"Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says",https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/student-loans-education-department-1447485,"Kathy Kraninger, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo education Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says

The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Education Department is impeding access to information that regulators need to oversee the nation’s largest student loan servicing companies.

Kathy Kraninger, the CFPB director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has accused the bureau of abandoning its responsibility to police companies that collect payments from student loan borrowers.

Story Continued Below

Kraninger said that “student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations” related to federal student loans, based on a December 2017 directive from the Education Department. The department is headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The CFPB “has pursued options that would have permitted it to obtain” the information it needs to supervise student loan servicers, Kraninger said in the letter, but she didn’t say whether those options had been successful. The letter was first reported by NPR.

Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Senate Democrats called Kraninger’s disclosure “disturbing news” in a letter to student loan servicers.

The senators said the Education Department had “removed a key weapon from CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers.” They also expressed concern that “federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' request for information.”

The CFPB has the authority to supervise large student loan servicing companies, regardless of whether they collect private student loans or federal student loans. That has long created tension between the Education Department and the CFPB over student loans.

The Education Department policy cited by Kraninger, first reported by POLITICO last year, orders federal student loan servicers to refuse requests for information from third parties like state attorneys general or the CFPB. The policy says those requests must instead be funneled through Education Department officials in order to comply with federal privacy laws.

The policy has been at the center of ongoing disputes between DeVos and state attorneys general seeking to investigate or take legal action against student loan servicers. DeVos has argued that her agency provides adequate oversight over the companies, rejecting efforts by state regulators to police the industry.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency “cooperates fully with federal law enforcement officials on matters related to the federal student aid programs.”

Hill said the policy prohibiting student loan servicers from responding directly to information requests by the CFPB or other regulators is about protecting the privacy of loan borrowers. Such requests for information “should be made to the Department, where they will be evaluated for compliance with the Privacy Act,” she said.

The Education Department has previously refused to say how many of those information requests it receives — and whether or not it has granted them. Senate appropriators last year directed the department to publicly disclose those decisions, but the department has declined to do so.

Court records reviewed by POLITICO last year showed that the Education Department had also turned down requests for student loan records made directly by state attorneys general.

The department last year also refused a request for information by the CFPB for information about Navient in connection with CFPB's massive lawsuit against the student loan servicer.

The CFPB said at the time that the Education Department was refusing to give permission for Navient to turn over a trove of documents relating to how the company collects and manages the payments of federal student loan borrowers.

A federal judge ultimately sided with the CFPB in the dispute. He ruled that Navient “cannot assert that the records may ultimately belong to the Department of Education or use the Privacy Act to shield the requested borrower documents” from the CFPB’s requests.

Sean Hannity: DOJ inspector general FISA abuse probe is 'done and it's devastating',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-probe-is-done-and-its-devastating,"Fox News host Sean Hannity says he is hearing that the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse is ""done and it's devastating.""

He made the assertion during his evening program on Wednesday and asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if he also had heard any word on the investigation.

Graham, whose Judiciary Committee had been conducting his own FISA abuse inquiry, said he could not verify if Inspector General Michael Horowitz is done, but added that he expects the eventual report to be upsetting to anyone who cares about the rule of law.

Hannity first brought up the prospect of Horowitz's investigation being complete earlier in the show, speaking with Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor.

""I have sources telling me that Horowitz perhaps is even finished with his report and certainly the attorney general has been briefed on what is coming,"" Hannity said. He also referred to former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova saying Horowitz determined that the three FISA extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained and was on the brink of finding the first FISA was completely illegal.

The completion of Horowitz's investigation would be news. Attorney General William Barr recently predicted that it would be complete in either late May or June, but there has been no official word of its progress since.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Horowitz announced his investigation in March 2018 in a statement that said his office was examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into President Trump's campaign. Horowitz also said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia that was used by the FBI in the Page warrant applications.

Horowitz can recommend that people be prosecuted. Jarrett noted that U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation, could then ""subpoena people to haul them in front of a grand jury. I suspect there is a grand jury and they're well on their way to potential criminal indictments.""

Jarrett said the people ""likely"" in legal jeopardy are former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI General Counsel James Baker, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, ""maybe"" former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and ""certainly"" Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson."
China sells most U.S. Treasuries in nearly two-and-a-half years,https://www.reuters.com,"['Richard Leong', 'Min Read']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-securities/china-sells-most-us-treasuries-in-nearly-two-and-a-half-years-idUSKCN1SL2U4,"(Reuters) - China sold the most U.S. Treasuries in almost 2-1/2 years in March amid uncertainty about a trade deal between Beijing and Washington, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Wednesday showed.

Since last week after a dismal 10-year Treasury auction, there has been renewed speculation whether China may sell its U.S. debt in retaliation for increased tariffs on $200 billion of its exports to the United States.

The latest data on China’s U.S. bond holding were collected before a sudden breakdown in trade talks between the world’s two biggest economic powers 1-1/2 weeks ago and prior to the U.S. duty hike on Chinese goods, which went into effect on Friday.

China sold $20.45 billion in Treasuries in March, the most since October 2016, following $1.08 billion in purchases the month before.

China’s stake in Treasuries fell for the first time in four months to $1.121 trillion in March, which was the lowest since May 2017 when it was $1.102 trillion. It was $1.131 trillion in February, the data showed.

“The decline this month brings China essentially flat to where they were in February, erasing the increases from December through February,” Jefferies LLC’s senior money market economist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

Despite the drop in Treasuries holdings, the world’s second-largest economy remained the largest U.S. creditor.

On the other hand, Japan raised its Treasuries holdings to $1.078 trillion, the highest since November 2017, from $1.072 trillion in February.

However, another set of Treasury data showed Japan sold $11.07 billion in U.S. government debt in March, the most for U.S.’s No. 2 foreign creditor, since February 2018.

(Graphic: China, Japan's sales of U.S. Treasuries - tmsnrt.rs/2J43Ggv)

Meanwhile, foreigners resumed sales of Treasuries in March as U.S. 10-year yields fell to 15-month lows after the Federal Reserve signaled it would not raise interest rates in 2019, according to the latest Treasury data.

They sold $12.53 billion in U.S. government debt in March after buying $19.91 billion the month before.

“Private investors have been big buyers of Treasuries since the beginning of the second half of 2018, but foreign official institutions have been inconsistent,” Simons said.

Official overseas selling of Treasuries coincided with a dollar rally in March spurred by safe-haven bids for the greenback amid worries about the global economy, trade tension and uncertainty around Brexit.

Central banks of export-oriented countries often sell their Treasury holdings to defend their currencies from a sharp appreciation of the greenback.

Overseas accounts also sold stocks for 11 straight months, reducing their equity stakes by $23.64 billion in March.

On the other hand, they bought $4.74 billion in agency securities and $1.11 billion of corporate bonds.

OUTFLOW PERSISTS

The latest data showed a net outflow from the United States totaling $8.1 billion in March, slower than the revised $21.5 billion in February.

Foreign central banks and other government entities accelerated their reduction of U.S. assets, selling $21.7 billion in March versus a revised $10.1 billion the month before.

The official foreign sales in March were offset by net purchases by private overseas investors which acquired $13.6 billion in U.S. assets after a revised $11.4 billion in sales in February."

David Bernhardt, secretary of the Department of the Interior, in his office in Washington. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about what his department is doing to address the causes and effects of climate change, noting that levels of carbon dioxide just hit their highest in human history.

His response? “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.”

The exchange is the latest escalation between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over what responsibility the Interior Department, which oversees more than 400 million acres of federal lands, bears in blunting a worldwide problem such as global warming. It came amid a barrage of legal citations from Democrats who claimed that current law compels the leader of the department to protect public lands from its impacts.

The remark came as Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) pressed Bernhardt about how concerned, on a scale of 1 to 10, he was about the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsing 415 parts per million, as recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

“Okay, so you're a zero or a one, is that it?” Cartwright said in response.

Later in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) gave Bernhardt the chance to expand on his comment, saying that for climate scientists it is a “hair-on-fire crisis.”

“It’s one of those clips of testimony that will reverberate,” he said. “People will look back to what you said.”

Indeed, after the hearing, environmental groups shared widely on social media videos of Bernhardt's “sleep” comment.

In response, Bernhardt said: “I absolutely care that our climate is changing and that we need to factor that into our thinking. I absolutely believe that. And I've said that over and over and over.”

He noted that among developed nations, the United States is “number one” in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The hearing Wednesday in front of the House Natural Resources Committee, ostensibly to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal for the department, was Bernhardt's second since being confirmed as interior secretary.

Last week in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Bernhardt punted the climate issue to Congress, telling members it was up to them to pass legislation compelling him to reduce emissions from public lands. Between 2005 and 2014, a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

“There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said, referring to the word in law that indicates a legally binding requirement. “You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

In the intervening days, House Democrats had clearly dusted off law books.

During the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) chided the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that sought to limit the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by oil and gas wells on the Bureau of Land Management lands.

And another Democrat, Mike Levin of California, rattled off four laws that, for example, compel the interior secretary to ensure that national parks are “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” and to “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” to BLM areas.

Bernhardt suggests the language in those laws did not direct him to do anything specific in response to climate change, such as stop leasing land for coal, oil or natural gas extraction.

“What I specifically said is you haven’t given me any direction to stop any particular activity,” he said.

John Leshy, interior solicitor under President Clinton, said that the legal language authorizing the government's land management programs is “necessarily general.”

“I give Bernhardt credit,” Leshy told The Post. “He's a wily guy.”

Leshy said Levin could also have mentioned the Endangered Species Act, which compels the interior secretary to use the “best available” science to determine whether a plant or animal is under threat of extinction.

On the dangers of climate change to biodiversity, he said, “the science is increasingly clear.”

At one point in yesterday's hearing, Democrats got Bernhardt to acknowledge that some laws — including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions — compel him to take climate change into account when managing lands.

“Certainly, NEPA would be one to them.”

Correction: The original version of this story referred to California Rep. Mike Levin as Mark Levin.

— Controversial mining leases renewed: BLM has renewed two federal minerals leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine by Minnesota mining company Twin Metals. The controversial decision follows a years-long clash over opening the state to minerals mining, the Star Tribune reports. The leases were ended by the Obama administration in 2016 over concerns about the environmental risks of mining near a protected wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

Trump administration touts economic benefit of new mining: “Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management.

“Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management. But Minnesota lawmakers are gearing up for a fight: ""Every sulfide-ore mine has failed to contain pollution and has affected the surrounding water quality,"" said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.). ""Once polluted, this incredible landscape and its wildlife will never been the same.""

— 2020 watch: Two Democratic presidential candidates, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, are out this week with new climate policies.

Warren: In a post on Medium, Warren laid out a plan requiring the Pentagon to reach net-zero carbon emissions for its infrastructure and non-combat bases by 2030. Her plan also calls for creating a “dedicated source of funding to adapt our bases in the United States and around the world."" It also targets contractors hired by the Defense Department, proposing that any contractor that doesn't reach the net-zero emissions mark pay 1 percent of the value of the contract, which would be used to “to invest directly in making our military infrastructure more resilient.”

— A plan to put up border wall through protected lands: The federal government is looking to replace barriers across 100 miles of the southern border with Mexico in California and Arizona, including through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Associated Press reports, citing environmental advocates and government documents.

The refuge specifically is meant to provide a designated home for 275 wildlife species. The report follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous laws in order to build more border wall. “The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,” the Center for Biological Diversity’s Laiken Jordahl told the AP.

— ""So you think we can innovate our way out of this?"" The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday hearing on climate change was the first to focus on the issue in a dozen years, the Washington Examiner reports, and lawmakers discussed various topics, including a carbon tax and clean energy.

During the hearing, Republican members also acknowledged there’s been a shift in rhetoric on the issue from their party. “We have gone from full of claims of [being] climate deniers to now we seem to be progress deniers,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said, suggesting Democrats haven’t appreciated the shift. “We are making progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we can learn from what’s brought us that progress to solve the challenge ahead of us, which is real.”

But: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) meanwhile, dismissed what he called “happy talk” about progress. “There was no acknowledgment about the terrible [climate change] impacts that are getting worse, and the Trump administration's concerted effort to make it even worse. So you think we can innovate our way out of this? We are on a path that is going to be very grim.”

— New York's pipeline predicament: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has until Thursday to decide whether to approve a proposed pipeline that would connect natural gas fields in Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York. The pipeline has been at the center of debate about the state’s energy future, the New York Times reports.

Environmental advocates are worried about the impact on vulnerable ecosystems and establishing a reliance on fossil fuels as some New Yorkers look toward pushing renewable energy sources. “While the pipeline has not attracted anywhere near the attention of the Keystone XL or Dakota Access pipelines in the Great Plains region, which carry oil, supporters and opponents alike said the gas project could be similarly consequential,” the Times reports.

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California state fire officials have concluded that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. equipment is to blame for the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in November and was the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the deadly blaze was sparked by electrical transmission lines controlled by the state’s largest utility and located in the community of Pulga, The Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler reports. In February, the company acknowledged it is “probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”

— An “an invisible cost” to deadly fires: Fire officials spoke to state lawmakers at a joint California Senate and Assembly hearing this week about the toll frequent deadly fires are having on firefighters and their mental health, as one fire captain from Sacramento called it an “invisible cost that’s rarely discussed.”

In California alone, the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance reports there have been 46 firefighter and emergency medical worker suicides in the past five years. Across the country, there have been 33 firefighter and emergency medical personnel suicides this year, E&E News reports. “At the hearing, fire officials said they needed more mental health support for emergency workers, both in the field during events and after the fires. They also said they needed more fire suppression personnel overall.”

— A trade-off for fast-growing trees: Although certain types of plants and trees could experience accelerated growth as a result of higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, a new study suggests those same trees could die faster, too. That means even as some experts say faster-growing trees could help combat global warming by drawing carbon in and storing the gas at higher rates, a new study in Nature Communications found “faster-growing trees also die younger, meaning the carbon they store goes back into the atmosphere more quickly,” E&E News reports.

The State Department has ordered all ""non-emergency"" U.S. government employees to leave Iraq right away.

The travel advisory specifically orders the departure of employees at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Irbil (sometimes spelled Erbil), noting that ""normal visa services will be temporarily suspended at both posts.""

Employees were urged to depart the country by commercial transportation as soon as possible and avoid U.S. facilities within Iraq.

It was not immediately clear what led to the order on Wednesday. The advisory instructs U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq because of high risks of terrorism, kidnapping and armed conflict.

The State Department warns that ""the U.S. government's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited.""

The New York Times reported this week that sources said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented an updated military plan last week — a plan that envisioned sending up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East in case of a move by Iran. It's not evident that President Trump has a desire to send so many U.S. troops to the region. Sources told the Times that the plan was ordered by those in line with national security adviser John Bolton, who is known for a hawkish stance toward Iran."

Horowitz’s work for the Justice Department, but he did say those who “love the rule of law” will be “very upset.”

“We now have two sources that told the FBI and the DOJ, the upper echelon, not the rank and file, I always make the distinction,” Mr. Hannity said. “I am told in both cases that with the [former British spy Christopher Steele] dossier, that [Department of Justice lawyer Bruce] Ohr warned them it was unverified — Hillary paid for it, Steele hated Trump. Also, now, we have the emails before the first application went in. It sounds like a premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud on a FISA court. I’m also hearing: Horowitz is done and it’s devastating.

“I can’t tell you what he found, but I can tell you that if you care about the rule of law you’re going to be very upset about how the DOJ and the FBI behaved themselves during the 2016 election,” he said. “If you hate Trump, you won’t care. If you love the rule of law, you’ll be very upset.”

Mr. Horowitz announced the investigation into alleged FISA abuse in March 2018.

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

The commerce ban does not prohibit U.S. telecom companies from purchasing Huawei gear, but instead bans Huawei from sourcing its supply chain components from U.S. companies. The move will hamper Huawei’s ability to conduct business internationally because of its reliance on U.S. companies for components for its gear, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The move comes one day after U.S. president Donald Trump declared a national emergency in relation to telecom equipment, claiming that “foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services.” Trump’s executive order prohibits U.S. companies from sourcing telecom gear from companies that pose a national security risk, but does not name Huawei nor China as specific threats.

RELATED: Trump to ban U.S. carriers from using network gear posing security risk: Reuters

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the ban is the result of President Trump’s request that the department to be “vigilant in its protection of national security activities.”

“This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign-owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Ross said in a statement.

In a statement, Huawei argued the ban would hurt American efforts to roll out 5G networks. “Restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior. yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of U.S. companies and consumers,” the company said. “Unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues.”

“We are ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security,” Huawei said.

The Commerce department made a similar move in 2016 against China-based telecom equipment maker ZTE, over allegations that ZTE was breaking U.S. sanctions. The ban had a devastating effect on ZTE’s business, causing the company to suspend its operations, as it was unable to source components from U.S. companies. Last year, ZTE reached an agreement with the U.S, government to pay over $1 billion in fines to have the ban suspended."

"Trump’s China Tariffs Are Worrying Farmers, Politicians",https://www.usnews.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2019-05-17/trumps-china-tariffs-are-worrying-farmers-politicians,"President Donald Trump leaves the Rose Garden after a press conference at the White House on May 16, 2019. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

Farmers are frustrated. Automobile workers are edgy. Consumers are bracing for cost increases. And the nation poised this year to eclipse the United States as the world's biggest consumer market is refusing to budge as the Trump administration tries to get China to play fair on trade.

This was not the sort of wartime leader most presidents expect to be. But Donald Trump, praised by his acolytes (and himself) as a master negotiator and derided by his critics as more bully than bully pulpit orator, has gotten the country in a good old-fashioned trade war. And it's one that may produce no economic or political winner.

Lawmakers in both parties have been irritated for some time over what they see as unfair trade practices by China, where there is more state control over the economy. The United States suffers from an enormous trade deficit with China, importing such items as electronics, clothing and manufactured goods. One exception is agriculture: The U.S. exports more to China than it imports. The Trump administration and other critics have also accused China of intellectual property theft and a variety of unfair trade practices.

""Most of my state's farmers support the president ... Yet, in return, these trade policies have taken money out of their pockets.""

Trump responded this month by increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent. China responded by saying it would raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. exports starting June 1. The stock market tumbled, then recovered somewhat, and Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on virtually every import from the Asian giant – a tactic meant to force China to make trade concessions at the bargaining table.

But there appears to be no sign of blinking from the Chinese, and that's worrying American farmers, who rely on China as a market, as well as other U.S. businesses that buy supplies from Chinese manufacturers.

""The president is essentially betting the farm. Somebody else's farm,"" says Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. ""It's his M.O.,"" Blumenthal added, his annoyance with the president bleeding over into a distaste for the president's overall approach to business and negotiations. ""He always makes bets with other people's money. Usually it's the banks' money. That's why the banks don't lend him money anymore.""

Republicans are mad, too, though they are reluctant to publicly criticize the president for the situation. Many of the worried farmers and manufacturers are in states Trump won and which are now represented by GOP senators. Lawmakers are working on an aid package, tentatively set at $15 billion to make up for agricultural losses, but an extended trade war could do more long-term damage, economic experts say.

And consumers across the country are certain to be hit with higher prices for everything from washing machines to sneakers, as manufacturers are forced to pass on the cost of the China-imposed tariffs. That's especially unappealing to lawmakers up for reelection next year.

Political Cartoons on the Economy View All 218 Images

""We need to stand firm against China's trade policies. They've stolen intellectual property from the United States,"" says Sen. Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado and one of the most vulnerable GOP senators in next year's elections. But ""I don't like tariffs. I think they are a tax on American consumers, and it has to end. Now.""

Sen. Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat who scored an upset victory in a special election last year and must defend his seat in 2020, found in the tariffs a perfect opportunity to tell his conservative, agrarian constituents that the president they overwhelmingly supported in 2016 did not have their best interests at heart.

""This is a dire situation. I am not trying to just light fire somewhere. This is really serious for these folks,"" Jones said on the Senate floor. ""Many of my state's farmers – probably most of my state's farmers – support the president, as do others around the country. They have had his back over the last two or three years, even during the campaign,"" Jones added. ""Yet, in return, these trade policies have taken money out of their pockets."""

"Homeland Security to allow border wall to go through national monument, wildlife refuge",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-to-allow-border-wall-to-go-through-national-monument-wildlife-refuge/,"The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding will come from the Defense Department following the emergency declaration that President Donald Trump signed this year after Congress refused to approve the amount of border wall funding he requested.

Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona.

Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.

""The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,"" said Laiken Jordahl, who works on border issues at the Center for Biological Diversity.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has typically not said much about construction plans.

At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, row after row of cactuses decorate 516 square miles of land that once saw so much drug smuggling that over half the park was closed to the public. But illegal crossings in that area dropped off significantly in the past several years, and the government in 2015 reopened the entire monument for the first time in 12 years.

While Arizona has seen an increase in border crossers over the last year, most are families who turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. The number of drugs that agents seize in the state has also dropped significantly.

But the government is moving forward with more border infrastructure.

The waivers the department issued Tuesday are vague in their description of where and how many miles of fencing will be installed. The Center for Biological Diversity says the plans total about 100 miles of southern border in both Arizona and California, near Calexico and Tecate.

In Arizona, construction will focus on four areas of the border and will include the replacement of waist-high fencing meant to stop cars with 18- to 30-foot barriers that will be more efficient at stopping illegal crossings.

The government has already demolished refuge land in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and construction is set to begin any day. On one section of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, crews have used heavy construction equipment to destroy a mix of trees, including mesquite, mulberry and hackberry. Those trees protect birds during the ongoing nesting season.

According to plans published last year, the cleared land will be filled in and a concrete wall will be installed, with bollards measuring 18 feet installed on top.

After months of public outcry, Congress forbade U.S. Customs and Border Protection from building in the nearby Santa Ana wildlife refuge or the nonprofit National Butterfly Center.

Dems request investigation of lobbyist-turned-EPA employee who met with former boss,https://thehill.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/444125-dems-request-investigation-of-lobbyist-turned-epa-employee-who-met,"Three Senate Democrats are requesting an investigation into a former lobbyist, now an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employee, who met with her former boss as well as members of the trade group she once worked for.

Elizabeth Bennett, who works in the external engagement office for EPA, met with both her former employer, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), and utilities that are members of the group that were seeking to change EPA policies.

Bennett was on the job for more than seven months before signing a recusal from dealing with NRECA, where she was a lobbyist, but EPA said it was determined on Day One she should not be in contact with her former employer.

“She was recused or still is recused from working with NRECA, her former employer, not the members. She inquired about just that during her initial ethics briefing upon joining the agency,” said Michael Abboud, an EPA spokesman.

Democrats argue Bennett’s correspondence and actions may violate ethics rules that encourage government employees to step away from issues where their impartiality may be questioned.

The issue stems from two Missouri-based power plants run by Associated Electric Cooperative Inc. (AECI), a member of NRECA. Those facilities were hit with a notice of violation from EPA in 2011 for failing to get required permits and for failing to install the best pollution controls.

According to a timeline constructed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which the three senators are members, Bennett was on the job for less than a month when she began communicating with NRECA members, setting up a visit to the two power plants by former EPA Secretary Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOn The Money: New financial disclosures provide glimpse of Trump's wealth | Walmart, Macy's say tariffs will mean price hikes | Consumer agency says Education Department blocking student loan oversight Overnight Energy: EPA watchdog finds Pruitt spent 4K on 'excessive' travel | Agency defends Pruitt expenses | Lawmakers push EPA to recover money | Inslee proposes spending T for green jobs Lawmakers take EPA head to task for refusing to demand Pruitt repay travel expenses MORE in April 2017.

“Within weeks of starting at EPA, Ms. Bennett participated in undisclosed meetings with her former employer,” the senators wrote, adding that she “facilitated and participated in substantive conversations between NRECA and EPA regarding issues of interest to NRECA, and facilitated and participated in substantive conversations regarding an electric generation facility in Missouri owned by one of NRECA’s member companies, Associated Electric Cooperative Inc.”

Once the upcoming meeting was revealed by MissouriNet, a Missouri media outlet, Bennett participated in discussions with NRECA members about how to manage the resulting press.

Bennett looped her former boss at NRECA into the discussion and directed her deputy to contact MissouriNet to “right the ship.”

“With a little direction, they might be helpful to our effort,” she said.

The next day Bennett met with her former boss at NRECA along with power plant operator AECI and Pruitt.

Abboud said the EPA had yet to receive the letter from the senators, instead learning about it through reporters.

“We will respond through the proper channels when received,” he said.

Bennett signed the Trump ethics pledge about two months into her job at EPA and signed a formal recusal from dealing with NRECA about 7 months into the job.

“Democrat members requested a written recusal statement, and Ms. Bennett complied,” Abboud said.

Abboud did not address Bennett’s meetings with NRECA but said contact with their members, doesn’t violate her ethics pledge since “a member of a trade association is not considered a ‘former employer.’ ”

A spokesperson for the Senate Environment and Public work committee disagreed.

“Our documents clearly illustrate that as an EPA employee Ms. Bennett worked directly with NRECA just weeks after leaving the trade association, so it doesn’t appear that she was ‘recused’ from working with them at the time that work took place,” the committee said in a statement to The Hill. “Regarding EPA’s defense for her work for AECI – that’s a distinction without a difference. NRECA is a trade association that advocates for the shared interests of their voting members cooperatives, one of which is AECI. These cooperatives help shape and set the agenda of NRECA’s advocacy efforts.”

Democrats have requested investigations into a number of EPA staffers, most recently William Wehrum and David Harlow.

The men came under fire for their work with the Air Permitting Forum and the Utility Air Regulatory Group — both groups included companies that both men had recused themselves from dealing with.

In responding to the allegations against Wehrum and Harlow, EPA argued the men had recused themselves from dealing with companies that were former clients — not the trade association groups those companies were a part of."
"State Department official cited Steele in emails with Ohr after flagging credibility issues to FBI, docs reveal",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-department-christopher-steele-bruce-ohr-judicial-watch-russia-dossier,"Shortly after the 2016 presidential election, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec and Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr discussed new allegations concerning the Trump campaign's Russia connections that were sourced to British ex-spy Christopher Steele, according to documents made public Wednesday.

The previous month, in October 2016, Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavelec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims were apparently false, to a senior FBI executive.

Despite Kavalec's concerns, the FBI used Steele's information to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page just weeks later. The warrant application did not clearly state that the dossier's creation was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

The email correspondence between Ohr and Kavalec highlighted Steele's influence in the DOJ and State Department even as concerns about his reliability mounted, and shed new light on a pivotal period in federal authorities' probe of the Trump team.

The documents were unearthed this week as part of a transparency lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch.



On Nov. 21, 2016, Kavalec began by thanking Ohr for stopping by to discuss the OCDETF (Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force), then added: ""Regarding the person I mentioned, Simon Kukes, below are a couple of links to the story I mentioned.""

DEEP STATE OF PANIC: DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER WHETHER BRENNAN, COMEY PUSHED STEELE DOSSIER



The first was a Mother Jones piece entitled, ""A Major Russian-American Oil Magnate Is Putting Big Money Behind Trump’s Campaign."" The second was an OpenSecrets article, ""Russian-born oil magnate gives big to Trump Victory.""

The articles reported that Russian-American oil magnate Simon Grigorievich Kukes had donated $150,000 to the Trump campaign and a related committee, his first donations in a federal election campaign.



""On this campaign donation story, I just wondered what, assuming this is true, the original source of the funding might have been,"" Kevalec wrote, noting that State Department colleague Tom Firestone had previously introduced her to Kukes personally.



Ohr responded: ""Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I really hope we can get something going here."" Ohr did not specify exactly what he meant.



""This is very interesting -- I may have heard about him from Tom Firestone as well, but I can't recall for certain,"" Ohr continued. ""We will take another look at this. Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing everyone at the next meeting.""



In a follow-up email, Kevalec said she was ""re-looking"" at her notes from her October 2016 meeting with Steele, whose anti-Trump views are now widely known.

“I see Chris [Steele] said [Simon] Kukes has [sic] some connection to Serge Millian,"" Kevalec wrote to Ohr. Millian is a Russian businessman and a purported source for the Steele dossier.

The Hill's John Solomon first reported details of Kevalec's meeting with Steele, which Fox News later confirmed. On Nov. 1, 2016, the FBI fired Steele as a source, citing his leaks to the news media.



But the FBI had already relied on much of Steele’s work to pursue a FISA warrant against Page in October 2016. And emails previously uncovered by Judicial Watch revealed that Ohr remained in regular contact with Steele even after he was fired by the FBI as a source -- effectively providing Steele a back channel to reach the FBI and Justice Department.

According to Kevalec's notes, Steele told her of “a technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and acknowledged that he wanted his allegations publicized in advance of the 2016 presidential election.

Steele also told Kevalec that “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami,"" according to Kevalec's notes. Kevalec quickly debunked Steele's assertion, writing in her memo: “It is important to note that there is no Russian consulate in Miami.”

WHO IS THE US ATTORNEY THAT BARR APPOINTED TO LOOK INTO FBI, DOJ MISCONDUCT?

Fox News reported earlier this year that Ohr's own meetings with Steele in 2016 were shared by Ohr with his expansive circle of contacts inside the department -- including senior FBI leadership and officials later assigned to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.



Additionally, Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS, the research group that commissioned the dossier. Nellie Ohr conducted extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working there, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress released earlier this year.

Her tenure at Fusion GPS lasted from October 2015 to September 2016.

Nellie Ohr also testified that when she was hired by the firm’s co-founder Glenn Simpson, he was aware that her husband was a high-level Justice Department official."
"Exxon and Energy Department Team Up on Biofuels, Plastics Research",https://www.scientificamerican.com,"['John Fialka E E News', 'About The Author S', 'John Fialka', 'Recent Articles', 'E E News']",,,,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-and-energy-department-team-up-on-biofuels-plastics-research/,"Research collaborations for cleaner, more energy-dense biofuels and recyclable plastics are at the heart of a new agreement between Exxon Mobil Corp. and Department of Energy laboratories.

Bill Farris, associate director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., explained that the agreement will give scientists better insights into future energy markets and ways to scale up cleaner forms of energy.

“Exxon has to think about how you scale things up,” Farris said in an interview about Exxon’s commitment to contribute $100 million to research by NREL and 16 other DOE laboratories over the next 10 years. “That’s probably one of the things we’re most excited about: taking things into the marketplace at scale. NREL could never do that alone.”

He said discussions that led to the agreement last week—one of the largest research projects that DOE labs have with a commercial company—started with biofuels and then expanded to a broad array of joint research discussions that are still underway. The labs and Exxon started talking about the agreement in November 2017.

They began with Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering Co. “Sparks started to fly, we developed a good relationship,” recalled Farris.

In a statement released last week, Swarup said the research partnership is intended to “explore ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and [energy] storage to commercial uses across the power generation, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.”

Exxon is the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, and it has stressed that the agreement with DOE is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “on a global basis.”

Biofuels will likely be essential to that effort in the transportation sector, explained Farris, because while research has shown that electric cars can reduce greenhouse gases, the trucking and aircraft industries will require more energy-dense fuels to reduce their emissions. NREL has been experimenting with various biofuels to deliver extra energy, and Exxon has focused on algae-based fuels to fill the gap. But it will likely take more experiments and collaborations to see what technology can be scaled up for global use.

One possibility that’s intriguing researchers is fuel made from captured carbon dioxide emissions. Both NREL and its sister laboratory in West Virginia, DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), are working on capturing emissions and putting them to use.

Exxon is interested in that, as well, along with ways to store energy. The use of hydrogen-based fuels as a way to store renewable forms of energy from electricity sources, such as solar and wind power, is another research objective.

“We see renewable energy producing electricity at very, very low costs in the future,” explained Farris, pointing to uses in transportation, buildings, factories and homes.

NREL has smaller research partnerships with other major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Norway’s Equinor ASA and France’s Total SA. “They’re all trying to figure out what future markets are going to look like. Where Exxon is coming from, for example, the planet is going to have 9 billion people, and the quality of their life depends on that energy, and that energy has to have lower carbon,” added Farris.

One of the questions under scrutiny by oil companies, he said, is what future gas stations will look like. While Exxon hasn’t raised the question yet in its discussions with DOE, “I have to think they’re interested in that,” Farris said.

Major oil companies own a large number of gas stations, and in the future they may be required to supply fuel cell-powered cars with hydrogen to recharge electric cars quickly and to supply biofuels for heavy trucks.

Exxon, Farris noted, has a substantial presence in the chemical industry, and one of its research objectives is plastics that don’t use petroleum feedstocks, or that can be recycled to rid the world of its plastic waste problem, which is mounting annually.

In the near future, dozens of Exxon scientists from Texas and the East Coast will be coming to Golden to work on some of these projects with their counterparts at NREL. “If you can increase the contact time between researchers, we think you get better results,” Farris said.

The DOJ won’t say why Rudy Giuliani hasn’t registered as a foreign agent under FARA law,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/why-isnt-rudy-giuliani-registered-as-a-foreign-agent-fara-lobbying-in-ukraine-a9289f19677e/,"Amid last week’s furor about Rudy Giuliani pledging to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — and Giuliani’s claim that he wanted to “meddl[e] in an investigation” regarding Biden’s son in Ukraine — was a small, buried detail that may yet unravel Giuliani’s entire plan.

Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, has worked in Ukraine since Trump’s inauguration, nominally as a security adviser to the city of Kharkiv with his firm Giuliani Partners. However, one of his local clients claimed last week that Giuliani provided far more than technical advice and a handful of photo-ops.

According to Ukrainian developer Pavel Fuks, Giuliani had been hired to work as a “lobbyist” for the government of Ukraine, as well as for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. “This is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the Times. The claim backs up local media coverage of the relationship, with one Ukrainian magazine writing that Fuks hired Giuliani in order to create an office in the U.S. for “supporting investment” in Kharkiv. As Mother Jones reported, Giuliani connected with Fuks via TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a New York-based company that has “advised Russian oligarchs and others with Kremlin ties.”

Giuliani denied Fuks’ claim, saying that Trump remains his “only client.” Giuliani didn’t respond to ThinkProgress’ questions on the matter, and ThinkProgress’ efforts to contact Fuks were unsuccessful.

If anyone needs to be investigated, it’s Rudy Giuliani. Rudy was “a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine” but failed to register under FARA. His clients, Pavel Fuks and Gennadiy Kernes, have reported ties to organized crime. How is he different than Manafort? https://t.co/O0ZdUkmoex — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) May 10, 2019

However, Fuks’ claim adds significant fuel to longstanding concerns about Giuliani’s decision not to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department — even as the agency goes to unprecedented lengths to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

FARA regulations, on the books since 1938, had remained an afterthought for decades. But thanks to Trump’s rise, and due especially to the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, FARA has seen new life. The DOJ already created a new task force to strengthen FARA, making sure that those working on behalf of foreign governments and officials disclose and detail their work with the DOJ, and prosecutors have shown a new willingness to finally enforce the regulations.

In just the past year, failing to register with FARA has tripped up former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former White House counsel Gregory Craig — both of whom were found guilty of failing to register their work on behalf of the former Ukrainian government. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA.

Giuliani, though, has thus far managed to escape scrutiny. And no one’s quite sure why.

Last September, months before Fuks claimed that Giuliani had been hired directly to lobby on behalf of Ukraine, a number of Democratic senators signed a letter to the DOJ requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA filings (or lack thereof). Giuliani admitted last year that he’d never filed a single FARA registration.

The senators specifically pointed to Giuliani’s work in Ukraine, including a press release linking Giuliani with Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, himself a former member of the party affiliated with ousted Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Both Manafort and Craig were indicted for failing to disclose FARA-related work on behalf of Yanukovych’s regime.

The senators writing to DOJ — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) — specifically singled out Giuliani’s work in Ukraine:

Giuliani’s work on behalf the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, whose mayor is a member of the Party of Regions is also concerning. The Ukrainian Party of Regions’ connections to the Russian Government and anti-democratic activity are well-documented. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who both served in senior roles on the President’s 2016 campaign team, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to criminal acts in part because of their work on behalf of this Russian-backed Ukrainian political party. Mr. Giuliani’s financial connection to the organization, the organization’s close ties with the Russian government, and Mr. Giuliani’s ongoing public advocacy against Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election raises further questions that warrant review.

And it’s not just Giuliani’s work in Ukraine. As the senators noted, Giuliani’s efforts at recruiting foreign clients — all while working closely with the sitting president — have spanned the globe. He’s represented the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, in its efforts to lift their Foreign Terrorist Organization designation from the State Department. He recently signed up with Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior, as The Daily Beast found. And, perhaps most notably, he wrote a remarkable letter to Romanian authorities, chastising the country’s prosecutor for being too effective at combating corruption — all while working at the behest of another lobbyist representing an official caught up in Romania’s anti-corruption dragnet.

But it was Giuliani’s misadventures in Ukraine that gained the most notoriety. And over the past week, the questions — about Giuliani’s aims, about who’s paying for his travel, about how much Trump knows — have only grown.

The DOJ, though, has been silent. As multiple staffers working for the Democratic senators told ThinkProgress, the DOJ never even bothered to reply to their inquiries about Giuliani’s FARA status.

“DOJ never responded to our letter,” a spokesperson for Udall told ThinkProgress. “However, we did confirm that they received it.”

As Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), another signatory of the letter requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA status, tweeted last Friday, “Giuliani has reportedly been paid by foreign [governments] + political parties, including in Ukraine, but FAILED to register as a foreign agent as the law requires. This is EXACTLY why I joined @SenatorTomUdall to ask DOJ to investigate. We never got a reply.”

Giuliani, unsurprisingly, has long denied any need to register as a foreign agent. Despite the fact that experts on FARA regulations have pointed to Giuliani’s foreign work time and again — both in terms of his speeches and political activities — as examples of FARA-related work, Giuliani has claimed that he’s not influencing American policy.

However, Giuliani also offered a caveat last week: “I don’t think I’m influencing American government except on behalf of my client to further an investigation.” That is, Giuliani admitted that he’s not working to “influence” U.S. policy — except when it comes to his client, the president of the United States.

It doesn’t appear concerns about FARA regulations will slow Giuliani’s work anytime soon. Despite calling off his trip to Ukraine — and despite Fuks’ claims that he has paperwork clarifying Giuliani’s work as a lobbyist in Ukraine — Giuliani has refused to acknowledge any issues with his work in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to FARA.

As he said on Friday, when it comes to Ukraine, “I’m going to make sure that nothing scuttles the investigation that I want.”"
Homeland Security asks military to build tent cities for migrants near border,https://nypost.com,['May'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/homeland-security-asks-military-to-build-tent-cities-for-migrants-near-border/,"The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military to build half a dozen tent cities near the southern border to house some 7,500 migrants, according to a report.

A Defense Department spokesman confirmed to NBC News that DHS made the request, which acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan is expected to sign.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the military, will handle the detention and custodial duties at the six camps, which will likely not be on military bases, according to the report.

In a statement, a Defense Department rep said DHS made the request for assistance on May 9.

“After discussions with DHS on the details of the RFA, DHS has agreed to ask that DOD will loan and erect on-hand DOD tents in support of ICE, and provide contracting support to ICE for wraparound services for which ICE will reimburse DOD,” Maj. Chris Mitchell said.

Meanwhile, President Trump is set to announce his administration’s immigration plan Thursday during a speech in the Rose Garden.

The plan, which has little hope of getting through a divided Congress, was devised by the president’s son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, the administration’s most prominent hardliner on immigration reform.

According to a Bloomberg report, the plan includes wall funding — the hot-button issue that prompted a government shutdown this year — without enticements for Democrats like granting legal status to so-called “Dreamers.”

The plan places immigrants’ skills above family ties to the US and overhauls the asylum process, which is meant to ease the crush of migrants coming over the border."

The panel approved the measure in a 29-23 vote along party lines, advancing it to the full House, which is expected to take up the proposal in June.

Trump's budget proposal unveiled in March called for 23 percent cuts to State as well as large cuts to other departments in an attempt to curb debt and shift spending toward defense.

The Appropriations-approved 2020 spending bill also takes aim at several of Trump’s foreign policies, including provisions that would restrict the Trump administration from selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and block withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

It would boost spending for the state department and related agencies by $885.8 million and $174.2 million for the United States Agency for International Development operations. It also includes $6.3 billion for fighting HIV/AIDS.

During the markup, the committee rejected GOP amendments that would have stripped out provisions supporting the Paris climate accord, withheld certain funds from United Nations peacekeeping forces, and kept abortion-related restrictions in place.

The bill would reverse the “gag rule,” also known as the Mexico City policy, which stops U.S. funds from going to any organization that performs, educates about or advocates abortion.

Rep. Robert Aderholt Robert Brown AderholtDems advance bill defying Trump State Department cuts Maryland raises legal tobacco purchasing age to 21 Anti-smoking advocates question industry motives for backing higher purchasing age MORE (R-Ala.) warned that Trump had threatened to veto any bill that impeded on his administration’s abortion policy.

“The president has made his intentions clear,” Aderholt said. “Right now, if the bill stands at is it is, it could be vetoed and we could go toward a continuing resolution.”

The bill is the fourth of 12 appropriations bills to advance through the full committee, while eight have already passed through subcommittee, with another on the docket for Friday.

The bills are unlikely to become law as they are. Democrats are using their own set of overall spending numbers to guide the spending bills, despite the lack of an agreement with the Senate and White House on new spending caps.

The White House has proposed leaving current legislative caps in place, which would lead to dramatic spending cuts in both defense and nondefense spending.

While Senate appropriators opposed keeping the caps in place, they are waiting for a deal before starting the process of writing and marking up their versions of appropriations bills, which will have to be reconciled with the Democratic House bills.

Trump reportedly favors a yearlong continuing resolution that would keep current spending levels in place."
Cobb veterans welcome new clinic amid uncertainty over VA plans,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cobb-veterans-welcome-new-clinic-amid-uncertainty-over-plans/hkuHsbc4SyoLMY4GsiceYO/,"The Department of Veterans Affairs celebrated the opening of the first of four new clinics in Cobb County Thursday as the agency prepares to expand and shift services in the county.

The $1.2 million, 9,400-square-foot facility on Roswell Road in east Cobb will offer mainly primary care and is one of several facilities replacing a clinic in Austell, which had been Cobb’s only facility and is now slated to be closed.

Veterans who spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution expressed hope the new facility would improve veteran care, even as some raised concerns over the lack of public transit access to the new clinic and ongoing communication problems with the VA.

They also pointed out that closing the Austell clinic could pose problems for veterans in the southern part of the county who will now have to travel farther to see a doctor.

“I’m so grateful that they are building a new building because Austell is ancient,” said Dan Hydrick, a Vietnam veteran and volunteer with the Cobb Veterans Court. But, he added, most veterans he’s spoken to haven’t been informed of the changes and “Change is always stressful for veterans that are trying to seek treatment.”

That’s especially true of those in treatment for mental health issues, he said. The Roswell clinic will have psychologists but not psychiatrists on staff.

The other clinics in the pipeline will be on Dallas Highway in west Cobb, Herodian Way in Smyrna, and Bells Ferry Road in north Cobb.

In a statement, the VA said its clinic locations were chosen “based on the needs of Veterans through a competitive solicitation process.”

“The VA would be interested in learning of opportunities for improved transportation in Cobb County that would serve our Veterans and support efforts to do so,” it said. “The Austell clinic will not close until the South Cobb County and West Cobb County clinics are fully operational.”

Gregory Kendall, a spokesman for the VA, said the agency had sent letters to affected veterans but “we can always do a better job of communicating.”

The VA is also working to expand telehealth options, officials said.

Robert Smith, 59, an Army veteran of Operation Desert Storm, had his first appointment at the new clinic Thursday. Smith, who lives in south Cobb, said even though it was a longer commute for him, he is willing to travel for better service.

“I like what I see and what I’m feeling,” he said. “They seem like they’re more up to helping a soldier here. Austell, I wasn’t too happy there.”

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: DOJ inspector general FISA probe will find 'mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-doj-inspector-general-will-find-mistakes-in-fisa-probe,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Monday he expects the Justice Department inspector general to find ""mistakes"" committed by the bureau in its handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."

A DOL spokesperson confirmed Nick Geale‘s departure Tuesday but did not provide further details.

White House officials instructed Acosta to fire Geale after its review concluded that Geale's interactions with employees were damaging DOL morale, according to two former Trump administration officials with direct knowledge of the investigation.

According to the former officials, Geale created a culture of fear inside DOL’s headquarters with profanity-laced tirades and belittlement of subordinates.

“There are times when he goes completely loony,” said one of the former Trump officials, recalling Geale pounding the table and screaming during a meeting.

Geale, in a written statement, called the DOL staff “dedicated and professional,"" and said he was “very excited to spend time with my new family and take on the next challenges of our journey.”

One of the former Trump officials recalled a particularly fraught encounter in which Geale became furious about what he perceived as poor preparation for a meeting.

“Nick came into my office screaming and yelling and throwing papers on my desk,” the former official said. “I chose to leave [DOL] because I didn’t get any work done.“

“He’s abusive, he’s abrasive, he tries to be intimidating, he’s condescending,” the former official added. After this person complained to Acosta about Geale's rages, nothing changed. “He ratified Nick’s behavior,” the former official said. “He was privy to it.“

Bloomberg Law reported that in April 2018 Geale sent out a memo ordering the agency's top political appointees to ""physically remain in the Frances Perkins [Building] on the day before a hearing until all hearing preparation is completed.... No agency head is allowed to be out of town or otherwise even leave the building on the day before the Secretary testifies without affirmative permission from either Molly [Conway, deputy chief of staff] or me.”

A third person with knowledge of the situation said Geale alienated not only DOL officials but also ""people at the White House."" Some White House officials also expressed frustration to POLITICO with the slow pace of deregulation at DOL, and blamed that at least in part on Geale.

Acosta’s own proclivity for caution continues to bother Republican allies who expected a more forceful advocate for business. For instance, DOL has struggled for months to finalize a rule that would privatize some of the agency's apprenticeship training, as it was instructed to do by a 2017 order from President Donald Trump. Enthusiasm for the initiative is tepid inside DOL.

“Very few people, if any, in the building think that this will work,” another DOL official said.

News of the dismissal was first reported by Axios.

Geale‘s forced departure is more bad news for Acosta, who has spent the last few months fending off criticism of a 2008 plea deal he reached with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida. A federal judge in February ruled that the Justice Department’s failure to notify Epstein's victims of the plea deal before it was finalized violated the 2004 Crime Victims' Rights Act.

""In many positions at the Department of Labor, on Capitol Hill, and as a member of the National Mediation Board, Nicholas Geale is a national expert on labor issues,” Acosta said in a statement. “After years of hard work here at the Department, I wish him the best on his future endeavors.”

President Trump’s Immigration Vision Would Reshape the Visa System,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-16/president-trumps-immigration-vision-would-reshape-the-visa-system,"President Donald Trump pauses while speaking about immigration in the Rose Garden at the White House, Thursday, May 16, 2019, in Washington. The Associated Press

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced an immigration reform proposal that seeks to reshape the legal immigration system and enhance border security but does not address immigrants already in the country illegally or those with protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Trump outlined the plan's broad strokes in a Rose Garden speech at the White House, but the administration has not released a detailed summary or the full contents of the effort. Despite being touted as a policy proposal, the plan has not been converted into legislation.

As expected, the proposal centers on establishing a merit-based system for legal immigration. It would increase the proportion of skill-based visas given each year from 12% to 57% while dramatically limiting visas given to immigrants who have family in the U.S., Trump said.

""We discriminate against genius, we discriminate brilliance, and we won't anymore,"" Trump said of the current immigration system, calling the rules ""senseless."" Trump also said the current rules bar Americans from entry-level jobs and drive wages down.

The plan notably does not decrease the number of visas given each year – a reversal of one of Trump's earliest immigration promises and one that may alienate immigration hard-liners.

Instead, it calls for the creation of a points-based visa program that would prioritize immigrants with high educational achievement or skill, those who are young and those who would earn high wages. All existing visa categories would be replaced with a new visa dubbed the ""Build America"" visa, Trump said.

""This will bring us in line with other countries and make us globally competitive,"" Trump said.

The proposal also includes efforts to revamp border security. Trump touted the creation of a border security trust fund that would be financed through fees and revenue collected at the border. The plan would also ensure that 100% of people and vehicles crossing the border are scanned for drugs and other illicit goods, Trump said, but he did not give specific details on how that would be accomplished. The president also said the plan would eliminate child smuggling and screen out ""frivolous"" asylum claims but similarly did not provide details on those promises.

Trump made no mention of the Obama-era DACA program, which allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay in the U.S. Trump has tried to do away with the program but has been blocked by the courts. DACA holders can currently renew their status, but new applications are not being accepted. DACA has been a key immigration priority for Democrats, and any plan without DACA protections is almost certainly a non-starter with Democratic lawmakers.

Trump positioned the plan less as a policy proposal and more as an advantage for himself and other Republicans heading into the 2020 election, saying that the vision will be one of the reasons Republicans will flip the House and retain the Senate and presidency.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, devised the plan, and Republican senators were reportedly briefed on its contents this week to mixed levels of enthusiasm.

Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare,https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/democrats-doj-obamacare-1318932,"Attorney General William Barr's decision to stop defending the constitutionality of Obamacare has lead to heightened scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Health care Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare

House Democrats are mounting yet another confrontation with the Justice Department that could lead to subpoenas, but this time it's not about special counsel Robert Mueller's report — it's about health care.

Five committee chairmen foreshadowed a possible subpoena as soon as May 24 if Attorney General William Barr declines to provide documents related to his decision to stop defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act — the health care law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Story Continued Below

In letters to Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the chairmen wrote they've been asking since April 8 for documents connected to the decision, as well as testimony from four key officials involved in the effort. The request, they said, sought a response by April 22 but that the reply fell short. Now, they've given the Justice Department two more weeks to meet the committees' demands. They've also asked the White House to make budget director Russ Vought available for an interview.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The letters are signed by Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

Nadler's committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report to Congress as well as Mueller's underlying evidence. But the full House has yet to consider the committee's effort. Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week that other committees may want to combine similar contempt proceedings into one overarching floor vote that could come in the next few weeks.

Democrats are also locked in confrontations with the Trump administration over accessing Trump's tax returns — a request made by Neal's Ways and Means Committee. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded access to Mueller's report, as well, on national security grounds and has issued a subpoena for his files last week.

The new effort on health care could become part of Democrats' broader strategy if they continue to accuse the Justice Department of stonewalling by the time the new deadline arrives on May 24. But persuading other lawmakers to wait until June — after a weeklong Memorial Day recess — for a comprehensive contempt vote could be difficult. Rank-and-file Democrats have been clamoring for punitive measures against Barr for weeks for his handling of Mueller's report.

Democratic leaders believe that picking a fight on health care is better politics than other demands are — and the skirmish shows their efforts to confront the Trump administration have policy dimensions and aren't just Trump-focused investigations.

Democrats have attributed the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the health care law, known as Obamacare, to ""politically motivated forces"" in the White House. The Obama White House took a similar step in 2011 when the Justice Department, at Obama's urging, stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages — a move social conservatives denounced at the time.

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

State Department: US trying to remove protesters from Venezuelan Embassy in DC,https://www.cnn.com,"['Adrienne Winston', 'Eli Watkins']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/venezuelan-embassy-washington-dc/index.html,"(CNN) US law enforcement on Monday started the process of trying to remove protesters from the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, a State Department official said.

The move to evict the protesters from the embassy came after a group of US anti-war activists began moving into the embassy last month

Medea Benjamin, one of the founders of the anti-war group Code Pink, previously told CNN that diplomats from the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had given them access to the embassy before the diplomats left as the standoff unfolded between Maduro and Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido.

Venezuela's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for North America Carlos Ron denounced the removal of protestors on Monday

""The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not authorized the entry of police officers into the former Embassy building in Washington, DC.

BD’s CareFusion pays $3.3m to settle FCA claims with DoJ,https://www.massdevice.com,['Fink Densford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.massdevice.com/bds-carefusion-pays-3-3m-to-settle-fca-claims-with-doj/,"Becton Dickinson & Co. (NYSE:BDX) subsidiary CareFusion has agreed to pay $3.3 million to settle civil fraud claims alleging that it sold products without FDA approval, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

San Diego-based CareFusion faced claims that it bought and sold medical devices not approved or cleared by the FDA, which were then used in procedures by providers who went on to submit reimbursement claims through Medicare and Medicaid, according to the release.

CareFusion agreed to pay the government $3.3 million and admitted to buying and selling medical devices that had not received FDA approval of clearance, according to the DoJ posting.

“Medical devices that do not have the required FDA approval or clearance cannot be bought and sold for use on patients. When unapproved devices are used in medical procedures, it presents a public health and safety risk, and federal health insurance programs should not foot the bill. Medical device distributors must follow FDA rules and this Office will continue to hold them accountable when they don’t,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a press release.

In the settlement, CareFusion admitted to selling devices produced by a manufacturer that had not obtained FDA clearance or approval to market between 2007 and 2014, adding that the manufacturer wrongly claimed they were qualified for a pre-amendment status exception. The company went on to sell those devices to hospitals and other healthcare providers, according to the release.

After the manufacturer in question received a warning letter in 2014, CareFusion ceased selling the devices, according to the report.

“Americans rely on FDA oversight to ensure that their medical devices are safe and effective. When companies sell devices without proper authorization, they may be putting patients’ health at risk. We will continue to investigate and bring to justice companies that attempt to subvert the regulatory functions of the FDA, which are intended to protect the public health. We commend the efforts of the Department of Justice for their vigorous pursuit of justice in this matter,” FDA CDRH director Dr. Jeffrey Shuren said in a prepared statement.

Of the $3.3 million settlement, approximately $2.8 million will go to the U.S. while $478,460 will go to states “adversely affected by CareFusion’s conduct,” according to the release.

Earlier this month, Retractable Technologies (NYSE:RVP) said it inked a settlement deal with Becton Dickinson to resolve a long-running suit claiming BD engaged in false advertising, according to an SEC filing."
VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.
