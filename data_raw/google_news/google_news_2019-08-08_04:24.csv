Trump Comes to Console. El Paso Says No Thanks.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Simon Romero', 'Rick Rojas']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/el-paso-trump-escobar.html,"EL PASO — Earlier this year in his State of the Union address, President Trump described to the nation how the Texas border city of El Paso once had “extremely high rates of violent crime” and was considered “one of our nation’s most dangerous cities.” Then he turned it into the living argument for his border wall.

“With a powerful barrier in place,” he went on, “El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.”

In this West Texas border city, founded 360 years ago as an outpost of the Spanish empire, those words festered. So did words Mr. Trump repeated at a rally he held on the city’s outskirts a few weeks later. “Murders, murders, murders,” he said, in reference to immigrants, as the crowd chanted, “Build the wall!”

For many in El Paso, the potentially devastating consequences of the anger over immigration and race became apparent this weekend, when 22 people were killed at a Walmart and the white suspect warned of a “Hispanic invasion,” plunging the city into mourning. So Mr. Trump returned — this time to say he wanted to help the city grieve."
Owner of SoulCycle and the Miami Dolphins faces outrage and calls for boycott over Trump fundraiser,https://www.cnn.com,['Brian Ries'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/equinox-soulcycle-trump-fundraiser-boycott-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The billionaire owner of Equinox is planning a high-dollar Hamptons fundraiser for President Donald Trump , leading to calls for a boycott of the luxury gym and its associated businesses SoulCycle and Blink Fitness.

Real estate developer Stephen Ross -- who is chairman and majority owner of the Related Companies, which oversees Equinox Fitness -- will host a luncheon on Friday, according to the invitation, at which attendees will pay up to $100,000 for a picture with the President and $250,000 to listen in on a roundtable discussion.

The Washington Post first reported the fundraiser, sparking the outrage. The news didn't sit well with somepeople who frequent the gym, who assailed it as supporting a President whose inflammatory rhetoric and policies targeting people of color are out of sync with the gym's progressive and oftentimes famous clientele.

""Hey @Equinox - what's your policy for canceling memberships once a member finds out your owner is enabling racism and mass murder?"" comedian Billy Eichner asked

""Sorry @soulcycle ... you can't peddle 'inspiration' in your classes and have an owner funding hate and racism in the back room,"" actor Conrad Ricamora wrote. ""Byyyeeeeeeeeeee.""

Ross responded in a statement to CNN, saying that ""I have always been an active participant in the democratic process. ... I have known Donald Trump for 40 years, and while we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others and I have never been bashful about expressing my opinions. ... I have been, and will continue to be, an outspoken champion of racial equality, inclusion, diversity, public education and environmental sustainability, and I have and will continue to support leaders on both sides of the aisle to address these challenges.""

Samantha Bonizzi, a spokesperson for Equinox and SoulCycle, told CNN, ""Neither Equinox nor SoulCycle have anything to do with the event later this week and do not support it. As is consistent with our policies, no company profits are used to fund politicians.""

She added, ""We are committed to all our members and the communities we live in. We believe in tolerance and equality, and will always stay true to those values. Mr. Ross is a passive investor and is not involved in the management of either business.""

The Trump campaign has not responded to CNN's request for comment.

In a sign that the uproar may not be limited to boycott threats on Twitter, Equinox was added to a list of companies to boycott by Shannon Coulter, a self-described consumer advocate who manages Grab Your Wallet, a protest group that targets companies that support the Trump administration.

She said she was adding the company to her list Wednesday morning and encouraged supporters to contact Related Companies. Their demand : ""Cancel the Hamptons fundraiser. After that, it will only be possible to be removed if Stephen Ross is no longer with Related Companies.""

LGBTQ publications seemed to be especially offended.

And in a sign that the outrage could be spreading to other Related Companies businesses, Out magazine Editor-in-Chief Phillip Picardi called for fashion designers to boycott Hudson Yards in New York City -- one of the largest and priciest real estate developments in US history (and home to CNN offices) -- for Fashion Week.

Picardi wrote on Twitter , ""FYI I'm hearing designers for #NYFW are being offered Hudson Yards/the Vessel as a show space. Please, please: Don't give this man any more publicity or funds.""

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills also criticized Ross, who owns the team and a related nonprofit dedicated to equality in sports. ""You can't have a non profit with this mission statement then open your doors to Trump,"" Stills wrote on Twitter

Though it's early in the campaign to boycott Equinox, the move could be a boon for competitors.

On Instagram, users shared a message expressing hope that competing gyms such as Gold's, Crunch or 24 Hour Fitness would run promotions to get their business, so as to ""take your money out of the hands"" of Trump. Others expressed hope that Flywheel would welcome them in.

""I regret to inform you that the massive amounts of money you spend thinking it would go toward improving your health...is also going to Trump,"" Betches Media warned in its popular newsletter for young women.

""Stephen Ross, owner of Equinox, SoulCycle, PURE Yoga, and Blink Fitness, is hosting a massive fundraiser in Southampton this weekend for Donald Trump. This is the best reason I've ever heard for finally canceling that expensive gym membership. See you all at FlyWheel!"" they wrote."
White House drafting executive order to tackle Silicon Valley’s alleged anti-conservative bias,https://www.politico.com,"['Margaret Harding Mcgill', 'Daniel Lippman']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/07/white-house-tech-censorship-1639051,"Social media companies, including Twitter, have denied the allegations of bias, though they say they have blocked or removed users who violate community standards policies. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Exclusive White House drafting executive order to tackle Silicon Valley’s alleged anti-conservative bias

The White House is circulating drafts of a proposed executive order that would address allegations of anti-conservative bias by social media companies, according to a White House official and two other people familiar with the matter — a month after President Donald Trump pledged to explore ""all regulatory and legislative solutions"" on the issue.

None of the three would describe the contents of the order, which one person cautioned has already taken many different forms and remains in flux. But its existence, and the deliberations surrounding it, are evidence that the administration is taking a serious look at wielding the federal government’s power against Silicon Valley.

Story Continued Below

“If the internet is going to be presented as this egalitarian platform and most of Twitter is liberal cesspools of venom, then at least the president wants some fairness in the system,” the White House official said. “But look, we also think that social media plays a vital role. They have a vital role and an increasing responsibility to the culture that has helped make them so profitable and so prominent.""

Two other people knowledgeable about the discussions also confirmed the existence of the draft order.

None of the three people could say what penalties, if any, the order would envision for companies deemed to be censoring political viewpoints. The order, which deals with other topics besides tech bias, is still in the early drafting stages and is not expected to be issued imminently.

""The President announced at this month’s social media summit that we were going to address this and the administration is exploring all policy solutions,"" a second White House official said Wednesday when asked about the draft order.

Accusations of anti-conservative bias have become a frequent rallying cry for Trump and his supporters, seizing on incidents in which tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube have banned people like InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones or faced accusations of squelching posts by pro-Trump social media personalities Diamond and Silk.

The companies have denied the allegations of bias, though they say they have blocked or removed users who violate community standards policies. They have also faced complaints from liberal activists that they're too slow to remove hate speech, a category that some say includes Trump's own tweets.

The issue took center stage during a White House gathering in July in which Trump railed against censorship in front of a roomful of online conservative activists, and directed his administration to explore all “regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.” Just this week, Trump warned that he is “watching Google very closely,” citing the case of an engineer who has claimed the company fired him for his conservative views.

But the White House effort may be complicated by skepticism in some agencies involved in the discussions about tech policy. The Republicans at the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission have said publicly that they don’t see a role for their agencies in policing companies’ online content. The FCC and FTC have joined the Justice and Commerce departments in discussions about the potential bias crackdown.

“There’s very little in terms of direct regulation the federal government can do without congressional action, and frankly I think that’s a positive thing,” said John Morris, who handled internet policy issues at the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration before leaving in May.

He added: ""Although the government may be able to support and assist online platforms’ efforts to reduce hate and violence online, the government should not try to impose speech regulations on private platforms. As politicians from both sides of the political spectrum have historically urged, the government should not be in the business of regulating speech.""

One potential approach could involve using the government’s leverage over federal contractors, a tactic the Obama administration used to advance LGBT rights. A 2014 executive order prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against workers on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Trump earlier this year signed an executive order meant to promote free speech on college campuses by requiring schools to agree to promote free inquiry in order to receive federal research funding — something the schools were already supposed to do.

Concerns about harmful content online following last weekend's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, could become part of the discussion around the draft order on tech bias. The suspected gunman has been linked to a racist manifesto that, shortly before the shooting, appeared on 8chan, a fringe website known as a hotbed of white supremacy. Online screeds tied to two other gunmen in mass shootings in California and New Zealand have also appeared on 8chan.

Trump said Monday that he wants the government to work with social media ""to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike,” and the White House has invited internet and technology companies for a discussion on violent online extremism with senior administration officials Friday.

The first White House official said the administration sees no conflict between demanding that online companies allow free speech while expecting them to scrutinize people for signs of violence.

“They have a role, if not a responsibility, to monitor the content on their sites to ensure that people aren’t threatened with violence or worse, and at the same time to provide a platform that protects and cherishes freedom and free speech, but at the same time does not allow it to descend into a platform for hate,” the first White House official said when asked about the draft executive order.

But the federal government’s options on combating online bias are limited by the First Amendment. Another obstacle is a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which both protects online platforms from liability for content their users post and empowers the companies to remove content without fear of liability. That provision, Section 230, has increasingly come under fire from lawmakers of both parties frustrated with tech companies’ content moderation practices.

The administration could look to NTIA, the branch of the Commerce Department that handles communications policy, but that agency lacks regulatory authority and could simply convene interested parties to explore the issues.

And while the Justice Department has announced a sweeping antitrust review of whether tech giants are harming competition or stifling innovation, antitrust cases have not traditionally been used as tools to address complaints about online speech.

The prospects are also bleak at the independent agencies, the FCC and the FTC.

Section 230 doesn’t give the FCC a regulatory hook to act on, and the Republican commissioners who lead the agency have already taken a hard line against one major government effort to regulate broadband providers' conduct — the commission’s Obama-era net neutrality rules. And when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed proposing the creation of “third-party bodies to set standards governing the distribution of harmful content,” Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr derided it as a plea for the government to police speech.

“Outsourcing censorship to the government is not just a bad idea, it would violate the First Amendment,” tweeted Carr, who is a Trump appointee. “I’m a no.”

Conservatives have also spent decades opposing any attempt to revive the FCC's old Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to be balanced in their programming on controversial issues. ""FCC bureaucrats can neither determine what is 'fair' nor enforce it,"" the Heritage Foundation said in 1993.

Republicans at the FTC, which punishes companies for unfair or deceptive acts, also have said they don’t see a role for the agency in policing allegations of social media bias.

During an FTC oversight hearing in the Senate last year, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) argued that a tech company could be considered “actively deceptive” if it appears to be a neutral public platform and then engages in censorship. But Republican Commissioner Noah Phillips said the FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection authorities are “not authorities to police the First Amendment itself.”"
White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

The GOP has caught autocratic fever,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'August At Am']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/07/gop-has-caught-autocratic-fever/,"Five years ago, congressional Republicans blasted President Barack Obama as “Emperor Obama” and compared him to a king for his executive actions, most notably those protecting some undocumented immigrants. Ten years ago, conservative activists launched the tea party movement in large part as a call for a more limited federal government.

Today, conservative Republicans have moved sharply toward embracing a more powerful chief executive with fewer checks and balances.

A new Pew Research Center poll, in fact, finds that a majority of conservative Republicans (52 percent) agree that many problems would be solved “if U.S. presidents didn’t have to worry so much about Congress or the courts.” That number has doubled since last year (26 percent) and quadrupled from when Barack Obama was president in 2016 (13 percent).

Today, just 41 percent choose the other option, that it “would be too risky to give U.S. presidents more power” to confront problems.



via Pew Research Center (Pew Research Center/Pew Research Center)

Among the broader group of all Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, the numbers have also risen substantially in recent years. Just 14 percent favored fewer checks on the president in 2016. That number rose to around one-quarter in Trump’s first year-plus, and today it’s 43 percent of all Republicans.

And it’s not just a matter of partisanship either. It’s normal for a party to favor presidential powers more when it holds the office, but the shift among Republicans is considerably bigger than among Democrats. While the share of Republican-leaning voters favoring a more powerful executive has risen 29 points between 2016 and 2019, the corresponding drop among Democratic-leaning voters who favor that approach has been just 13 points, from 29 percent in Obama’s last year to 16 percent today.



via Pew Research Center (Pew Research Center/Pew Research Center)

(It’s possible being close to the 2016 election might have reined in support among Democrats for the proposition, given that could mean the more-powerful executive could soon be Trump. But this was still at a time when the vast majority of people — and especially Democrats — expected Hillary Clinton to be the next president.)

It’s difficult to separate this new poll finding from what has transpired over the entirety of the Trump presidency. Trump has sought to stretch his presidential powers to distances not even broached by Obama — including by using a national emergency declaration to build a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border — and along the way he has run into a series of adverse court decisions. Many of these decisions were momentary and/or came in particularly unfavorable jurisdictions. But the setbacks have also included a number of instances in which the administration simply didn’t make a valid defense of the change, including recently when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority blocked the 2020 Census citizenship question.

When met with such decisions, Trump has often attacked the judges behind them, regularly labeling them “Obama judges” and the like. His comments about judges in 2017 even earned him a rebuke from his then-Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch.

Trump has also been stymied by Congress, even though Republicans controlled it for his first two years. The GOP passed tax cuts but was unable to repeal and replace Obamacare, thanks to defections from its own members, including the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). As with the judges, Trump hasn’t held back in criticizing McCain, even continuing that criticism following McCain’s death.

Against that backdrop, perhaps it’s not surprising that Republicans view Congress and the courts as an impediment to the policy proposals they and Trump want. Obama occasionally decried the broken Congress and even criticized Supreme Court justices in a State of the Union address, but he didn’t ever go as far as Trump has.

A more sinister read, of course, would be that Republicans have warmed to a more autocratic type of leader given Trump’s regular praise and admiration for strongmen around the world. Whatever the case, it’s clear there has been a significant shift — not the kind that suggests the American people would sign off on a dictator, certainly, but one in which one of the two major parties has significantly less regard (or desire) for the checks and balances the Founding Fathers created."
"Former Freddie Mac CEO Donald Layton: Trump's Treasury says GSE reform has ""mostly happened""",https://www.housingwire.com,[],,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49799-former-freddie-mac-ceo-donald-layton-trumps-treasury-says-gse-reform-has-mostly-happened,"Donald Layton, who stepped down as the CEO of Freddie Mac a month ago, is providing some insight into the Trump administration’s view on GSE reform from his new perch at Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.

In a 17-page paper published on Monday – titled “GSE Reform: None or Mostly Done?” – Layton reveals a conversation he had a few months ago in a meeting with an unnamed senior official in the Department of the Treasury who told him: “GSE reform has already mostly happened.”

Layton described the comment this way: “One senior Treasury official said this, almost off-handedly as something fairly obvious, in a meeting I attended just before I retired from Freddie Mac.”

Layton’s paper supports the idea that the incremental changes over the last 11 years enacted by the Federal Housing Finance Agency have restored the so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, to a condition where they could be privatized without legislative input from a Congress that appears to be gridlocked.

Layton wrote: “In 2012, when I joined Freddie Mac, I was told, `legislation is imminent.’ So much for the predictability of congressional action!”

Layton lists all the Congressional efforts, including what came to be known as the “Crapo Plan” and the “Johnson-Crapo Bill,” before concluding:

“What has been the result of all the efforts at comprehensive reform listed above, with the two GSEs now in their eleventh year of conservatorship? The unadorned, no-spin, fully candid answer: nothing. There has been no comprehensive reform of the GSEs.”

But meanwhile, beginning with the 2008 creation of the FHFA, the new GSE regulator, reforms were underway, Layton said.

“Starting at the very beginning of conservatorship, even as debates about comprehensive reform requiring legislation took almost all of the public spotlight, the U.S. Treasury and the FHFA undertook incremental reforms that produced real improvement in the GSEs and the housing finance system, even if not revolutionary change,” Layton said.

Layton said he supports releasing the GSEs from conservatorship without input from Congress.

“While there are a number of technical and legal issues to be resolved for this exit to happen, especially those relating to raising capital and dealing with the outstanding preconservatorship common and preferred shares, there is no reason that the administration cannot put the GSEs on a path to be released from government control over the next several years,” Layton said. “On a pragmatic basis of actually getting something done, that would be my vote.”"
Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

So when Donald Trump’s improbable march to the White House picked up steam in the spring of 2016, Team Soros marched to the top of the State Department to protect some of those investments, according to newly released department memos providing a rare glimpse into the Democratic donor’s extraordinary access to the Obama administration.

Then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland received repeated calls, emails and meeting requests from Soros, according to the memos obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the conservative group Citizens United.

On May 25, 2016, for example, Chris Canavan of the Soros Fund Management firm provided Nuland a written briefing under the heading “Russia sovereign bond issue.” At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinUS Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman resigns The Hill's Morning Report - Trump, Democrats at odds over shootings' causes, cures Putin calls for talks after Trump pulls out of nuclear arms agreement MORE’s regime posed a threat to Soros’s vision for Ukraine.

“Toria, here is my take on Russia’s foray into the bond markets this week, based on the market chatter I’ve been able to pick up,” Canavan wrote in an email, released with heavy redactions hiding most of his advice to Nuland.

Canavan worked on the for-profit side of the Soros empire, and his cozy nickname relationship with the top State official responsible for Russia and Ukraine policy speaks volumes about the access Soros was afforded.

Six days later, the nonprofit side of the Soros empire rang the same doorbell. Soros and his top foundation official in Ukraine scored a hastily arranged call with Nuland to discuss European migration policy.

“Many thanks for sorting today’s call on such short notice — much appreciated,” a Soros official wrote Nuland’s aide. “During the call, Mr. Soros promised A/S Nuland he would send her his draft article on migration policy for the New York Review of Books.”

Few people in the world could command the attention of one of America’s busiest, most influential diplomats for a pre-publication read of a column. Soros apparently was one of those few.

A little over a week later, Soros's team reached out again to Nuland, this time seeking to discuss “EU visa liberalization for Ukraine and Georgia” after meeting in Brussels with a top European Union official. According to the emails to State, Soros’s team wanted the U.S. to intervene to get the EU to ease visa rules to help Ukraine, as that country pursued reforms advocated by Soros.

Nuland wrote back, alerting Soros’s top policy adviser on Eurasia, Jeff Goldstein, to a key piece of intelligence: One EU country “has changed its mind” and she was “happy to discuss this further.”

“We are working it. Not sure whether intervention by GS would help,” Nuland answered in response to Soros’s pressure.

Soros is arguably one of the largest, most influential donors of his generation, giving away as much as $1 billion a year to nonprofit and political causes and leaving an indelible imprint on policy positions of liberals worldwide. His reach and influence range from two dozen prosecutors he helped to elect in the United States, to fellows he helped train at the State Department, to global media institutions that he supports to the tune of $26 million annually.

His many admirers in America — including such financial beneficiaries as Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, as well as many of the 2020 presidential candidates — all advocate to eliminate the corrupting influence of big political money and the access that big donors win inside government. Often, those liberals suggest it’s a Republican problem.

But the 2016 State memos offer a powerful irony: In many ways, Soros is emblematic of the very financial influence and access that liberals seek to eliminate.

People close to Soros told me in interviews that he often had contact with government officials during the Obama years, including a 2010 meeting with Clinton at State. But they acknowledged the flurry with Nuland in spring 2016 was unusual both for its frequency and its intensity.

They said the exchanges were driven by Soros’s concerns about Ukraine’s future, not politics or business.

“George Soros is the founder of an organization that gives away a billion dollars a year to promote democracy and human rights around the world. It is for that reason that people at the State Department speak to him, not because he is a political donor,” top Soros aide Michael Vachon told me.

But a close examination of internal Soros organization documents show a close alignment of his political, business and philanthropic interests, especially in 2016.

Federal election records show Soros was one of the top 10 donors to Clinton’s 2016 election effort, giving a whopping $10.6 million to her campaign and the SuperPACs supporting it.

And when Soros sought to build U.S. pressure on Ukraine policy in 2016, he turned to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, as a prelude to Nuland.

“Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the U.S. as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally,” Vachon wrote Podesta in a March 2016 email that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russia and published by WikiLeaks. That email sought a meeting with the Clinton campaign chairman.

Politics and policy intertwined.

Likewise, Soros set out a bold vision in an internal 2014 memo for his Open Society Foundation to help root out corruption in Ukraine and build a “civil society” after the Maidan Revolution ousted the country’s Russian-friendly president. It worked with U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials to leverage the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative to fight corruption. The initiative enabled DOJ to prosecute or seek asset forfeitures from foreigners suspected of corruption, even if the crimes didn’t technically occur on U.S. soil.

Such initiatives are noble in principle. But, in Ukraine, some targets had political and business implications as well.

For example, one DOJ investigation in 2014 targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmitri Firtash. He and Soros both have significant energy interests in Europe — and rival plans to rebuild Ukraine. After Firtash’s indictment, Soros’s business announced plans to invest $1 billion in Ukraine.

Since then, significant problems have arisen with the DOJ’s case, thwarting efforts to extradite Firtash to the U.S. for trial.

Arguably, philanthropy and business collided.

On another front, a Ukrainian nonprofit funded in part by Soros was a cheerleader for the discovery of documents in Ukraine during the 2016 election that showed then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortJudge dismisses one of two charges against former Obama White House counsel Using the pardon power to encourage law breaking Federal prosecutors examining Trump friend's role in foreign lobbying: report MORE received millions in payments from Ukraine’s Russia-friendly political machine. The revelations led to Manafort’s resignation and eventual prosecution.

This time, philanthropy and politics found common ground for the Clinton-backing Soros.

And when Ukraine’s general prosecutor sought to investigate one of the country's nonprofits partially funded by Soros during 2016, the State Department pressured Ukrainian officials to drop the case.

Politics, philanthropy and governance were all intertwined.

Whatever political persuasion you hold, Soros’s election-year contacts at State speak volumes about the fact that big-money access to those in power is a bipartisan phenomenon.

Justice Department files amicus brief in Mazars case shielding Trump from House subpoena.,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/justice-department-mazars-subpoena-trump-barr.html,"Attorney General William Barr speaks at the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University School of Law on July 23 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice filed a disgraceful amicus brief urging a federal appeals court to block the House of Representatives’ subpoena of the president’s financial records. There is no clear purpose for the brief other than a blatantly partisan effort to shield Trump from congressional oversight. It is a startling departure from the DOJ’s traditional independence and another sign that Attorney General William Barr views his job as running interference for the president.

Donald Trump’s lawyers—his personal attorneys, not the DOJ—have been fighting this subpoena since the House Oversight Committee issued it in April. The committee sought eight years of financial records from Mazars USA, which provided accounting services to Trump. Congress has broad constitutional authority to investigate the president, and the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must honor any subpoena with a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Trump’s lawyers argue that the committee’s subpoena lacks such a purpose, and was merely intended to “harass” the president. In its amicus brief, the Justice Department parrots this argument, framing the House’s subpoena as an effort to torment Trump by inspecting his finances for political gain.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected that argument in May. Mehta noted that the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, had provided a memorandum detailing a number of legitimate reasons for the subpoena. Cummings wrote that the committee sought to learn whether Trump “accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics” so it could determine “whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws.” The committee also wished to discover whether Trump “has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions.”

The House has already passed an ethics bill, H.R. 1, this year with provisions aimed directly at the executive. Lawmakers plainly have a “legitimate legislative purpose,” Mehta wrote, in probing the president’s ethics to decide whether these reforms are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, the committee wished to know “whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office.” It “is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Finally, the committee sought to learn whether Trump had complied with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting any gift from a foreign government without Congress’ consent. “Surely,” Mehta wrote, “incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the President’s receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President’s compliance with the Clause.”

Trump’s lawyers promptly appealed Mehta’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of judges for the D.C. Circuit is currently mulling whether Mehta got it right.

The Justice Department had no reason to step in; Trump is amply represented by his own attorneys, and this matter does not require the defense of some federal law. To the contrary, the DOJ typically sits out such interbranch disputes, and it has no obvious interest in siding with the president against Congress here.

But the DOJ filed an amicus brief anyway—weeks after oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit—and it is flabbergasting. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts may not search for some covert illicit motive among committee members; if the committee states a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the judiciary must respect it. The DOJ ignores this rule. It argues that the House’s actions raise “the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch.” And it calls for a “searching evaluation” of committee members’ motives.

The DOJ argues that Cummings’ memorandum justifying the subpoena is “insufficient” because it was “not ratified by the full House.” It cites no authority for this proposition because it is made-up; the Supreme Court has never held that a committee’s subpoena is invalid until ratified by the full chamber. But even if that were the law, the DOJ has a problem: The full House already ratified the Mazars subpoena. In response to this fact, the DOJ claims that the House’s vote doesn’t count because “it did so only as part of a general authorization for pending and future investigations.” There is no precedent to support the argument that the House must ratify a subpoena with some unknown level of specificity; it is a blatant exercise in moving the goalposts. The DOJ is attempting to throw new roadblocks in front of the committee on the basis of its own pseudo-constitutional beliefs.

But that’s not even the strangest part of the brief. The DOJ insists that the House cannot investigate Trump pursuant to its impeachment authority. Why? Because it hasn’t asserted “jurisdiction over” impeachment. In other words, the House’s constitutional power of impeachment lies dormant until someone declares an intent to impeach. Who, exactly, holds this mystical authority? A committee chair? The speaker? A majority of lawmakers, shouting in unison? Who knows? The DOJ does not say when the impeachment power officially kicks in, because it has concocted this rule out of thin air. Maybe Mehta was on to something when he wrote that it “is simply not fathomable” that the Constitution could (silently) limit the impeachment power so arbitrarily.

Ironically, the DOJ ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to.

The DOJ brief fares no better in its dismissal of Congress’ authority over emoluments. Again, the Constitution explicitly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign states without Congress’ consent. But the DOJ argues that this power does not justify the subpoena because there’s no proof the House “is investigating the President with a view toward consenting to any undisclosed emoluments.”

That is a lie. Cummings’ memorandum expressly stated that the House sought “to assess whether [Trump] is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.” If that weren’t enough—and it is—Cummings is also investigating Trump International Hotel to determine whether it grants Trump unconstitutional emoluments. Recognizing, perhaps, that the courts cannot rigorously scrutinize a committee’s stated intentions, the DOJ has chosen to pretend the committee never stated those intentions in the first place.

Most gallingly, the DOJ urges the court to reject the legitimacy of the House’s legislative purpose by preemptively declaring its legislation unconstitutional. The DOJ writes that H.R. 1 and similar proposals do not deserve any “presumption of legitimacy” because they are probably illegal. It claims that the Constitution bars Congress from forcing the president to divest from his conflicts of interest. Thus, the House cannot investigate Trump to help it craft ethics reforms, since those reforms are unconstitutional.

This argument is astonishing. Federal courts are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions on the constitutionality of pending legislation. A bill cannot be challenged in federal court if it is just a bill; this is Schoolhouse Rock stuff. Yet the DOJ is essentially asking the judiciary to declare a provision of H.R. 1 unconstitutional before it becomes law. This vast expansion of judicial power would constitute an advisory opinion on steroids. The courts would be obligated to gauge the legality of bills under consideration in Congress every time they are asked to quash a congressional subpoena. That is not and cannot be the law.

Ironically, the DOJ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to. The Supreme Court curtails the judiciary’s ability to quash congressional subpoenas for a reason. Once courts start inspecting lawmakers’ motives, they become entangled in the legislative process. It is not the job of judges to decide whether the House really needed to issue a subpoena; once a committee stated a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the courts must butt out. Otherwise, judges will wind up curbing Congress’ constitutional powers and effectively killing legislation before it passes. The judiciary is ill-equipped to determine just how much information lawmakers require to govern effectively.

Still, counterproductive as the DOJ’s brief may be, it reveals the full extent of the department’s distortion under Barr. The Justice Department represents the United States, not the president himself, and it has no business putting its thumb on the scale of Trump in his fight against Congress. Barr may see the office of the attorney general as an outpost of the White House. He may see himself as a loyal foot soldier for Trump in his squabble with Democrats. But the Justice Department was never intended to be a weapon for presidents to wield against their political opponents. Tuesday’s brief degrades the institution, eroding its legitimacy for purely partisan goals."
China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
Six states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456560-epa-sued-over-decision-to-allow-use-of-pesticide-tied-to-brain,"Several states sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday over the agency's decision to allow further use of a pesticide linked to brain damage.

California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland and Vermont argued in court documents that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide, should be banned due to the dangers associated with it.

Earthjustice filed a similar lawsuit in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of groups advocating for environmentalists, farmworkers and people with learning disabilities.

“A chlorpyrifos ban is long overdue given the overwhelming evidence that says this pesticide harms brain development in children,” Tracy Gregoire, a project coordinator at the Learning Disabilities Association of America, said in a statement. “We are hopeful the courts will side with children who are now being exposed to irreparable, yet preventable harm.”

Chlorpyrifos, known on the market as Lorsban, is used on a wide variety of crops, including corn and cranberries. Farmers have called it the last line of defense against certain insects.

But it has also been linked to learning and memory issues and prolonged nerve and muscle stimulation.

The EPA banned chlorpyrifos for household use in 2001 over concerns it would cause brain damage in children.

EPA’s decision to allow continued use of chlorpyrifos came last month, the result of a court-ordered deadline to regulate the pesticide prompted by a lawsuit previously filed by Earthjustice.

EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said those challenging the use of chlorpyrifos did not have enough data to demonstrate the product is not safe. The EPA said it would continue to review the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022.

""Registration review is a comprehensive, scientific and transparent process that will further evaluate the potential effects of chlorpyrifos. EPA has also been engaged in discussions with the chlorpyrifos registrants that could result in further use limitations,"" the agency said in a statement to The Hill.

States argue that timeline is far too long.

“Parents shouldn’t have to question whether everyday fruits and vegetables will poison their children,” California Attorney General Becerra said in a statement. “The EPA is egregiously sacrificing our children’s health by refusing to make a determination on this dangerous pesticide.”

A month after former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Pair of GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule MORE began leading the department, the agency rejected an Obama-era recommendation from agency scientists to ban the pesticide.

In the absence of EPA action, some states have moved to regulate chlorpyrifos on their own. Hawaii last year banned its use, and California and New York are considering a similar move.

California, the nation’s top agricultural state, said it was obligated to take action due to research showing chlorpyrifos hinders brain development in children.

Farmers and other groups have urged the EPA to keep chlorpyrifos available.

“Without the ability to use chlorpyrifos, entire production fields could be lost,” the American Seed Trade Association wrote in a letter to the agency in 2017.

But many farmworkers say they have been injured by prolonged exposure to the pesticide.

“A nerve agent pesticide that poisons workers and damages children’s developing brain has no place near our fruits and vegetables,” Ramon Ramirez, president of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, a Latino farmworker group based in Oregon, said in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to seeing the courts do what EPA refuses to do, protect workers and children with a chlorpyrifos ban.”

Nikola receives $1.7M grant from US Department of Energy for fuel cell research,https://www.teslarati.com,['Simon Alvarez'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-rival-nikola-get-1-million-us-department-of-energy-fuel-cell-research/,"Nikola Motors was recently awarded by the US Department of Energy with a $1.7 million grant to help the startup advance its research into fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technology. The grant comes amidst the potential Tesla Semi rival’s continued efforts to develop durable hydrogen technology for commercial trucking.

In a press release, Jesse Schneider, Nikola’s executive vice president of Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Technologies, stated that the Department of Energy’s grant would allow the aspiring truck accelerate the development of hydrogen technology for its vehicles, which the company believes could potentially disrupt the lucrative trucking market.

“This award provides an opportunity for the highly talented Nikola team to leverage expertise in academia and exceptional resources within the DOE Fuel Cell Consortium for Performance and Durability to accelerate a breakthrough that will benefit the entire hydrogen and fuel cell industry and community,” Schneider said.

Nikola’s grant was given by the US Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Transportation Office, as part of the recently announced FY19 Commercial Trucks and Off-Road Applications FOA. NEL Hydrogen of Oslo, Nikola’s hydrogen partner, was also awarded a $2 million grant by the DoE.

The trucking startup’s fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) research is aimed at developing an architecture that could satisfy the power output needs and durability requirements of heavy-duty applications, such as the operations of the company’s long-haul vehicles like the Nikola One. The truckmaker noted in its press release that its research is being conducted alongside academics from Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, and Georgia Institute of Technology.

Nikola claims that it currently has 14,000 orders for its Class 8 trucks. The vehicles are expected to be manufactured in a factory in Coolidge, AZ. Testing is expected to begin on Arizona roads this year, with full production to commence in late 2022. Nikola is yet to reveal if its initial production runs will involve the original Nikola One sleeper truck, or the smaller, newer Nikola Two daycab, which was formally unveiled last April.

This timeframe would likely result in Nikola’s electric trucks entering the market later than the Tesla Semi, which is already undergoing extensive testing on multiple states across the US. Production of the Tesla Semi is expected to begin sometime next year, as noted by the electric car maker’s executives in the company’s first-quarter earnings call."

Former defense secretary Jim Mattis has been elected to the board of General Dynamics, the company announced after a vote on Wednesday, allowing him to reclaim a powerful position at the top of America’s defense industry.

The announcement comes at a time when General Dynamics ― one of the last military-industrial conglomerates remaining from the industry’s Reagan-era heyday ― is trying to remake itself for the information age. Last year, the company sealed a deal to buy CSRA, a massive Beltway IT contractor, for almost $10 billion. It is the fourth-largest corporate recipient of U.S. government contract dollars.

“Jim is a thoughtful, deliberate and principled leader with a proven track record of selfless service to our nation,” chief executive Phebe Novakovic said in a statement. “We are honored to have him on our board.”

Mattis’s compensation and benefits package is to be detailed in a later financial disclosure form.

[One of the Beltway’s biggest defense contractors is about to get a lot bigger]

Mattis is the latest influential military official to join a major defense contractor, part of the “revolving door” between business and government that has long concerned government ethics experts.

A report released late last year by the Project on Government Oversight found that defense contractors had hired at least 50 high-level government officials since Trump became president, among more than 600 such instances in the past decade.

Mattis began his first stint on the board of General Dynamics in 2013 after more than 40 years with the U.S. Marine Corps. From 2010 to 2013, he led U.S. Central Command, which spearheads the military’s operations in the Middle East, including in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.

He commanded a rare respect bordering on reverence among many members of the armed services, and cultivated a public image defined by uncompromising toughness.

He never married, and is often described as a “warrior monk” for his bookish devotion to military strategy and history. He adopted the call sign “chaos,” which stands for “Colonel Has An Outstanding Solution,” he told an audience at the National Harbor in 2017.

Mattis led the Defense Department during the first two years of Trump’s presidency. Trump frequently expressed admiration for him in public, referring to him as one of “my generals,” and calling him by his other nickname, “Mad Dog” Mattis.

Behind the scenes, Mattis often seemed to check the president’s instincts. According to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s 2018 book “Fear: Trump in the White House” Mattis once told an associate that “we’re not going to do any of that. We’re going to be much more measured,” after Trump had told the defense secretary by phone to kill Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Mattis left government for the second time in December. He had clashed with the president over a plan to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, saying Trump should appoint someone who was “better aligned” with his views.

[Mattis, once one of ‘my generals,’ loses his influence with Trump]

As defense secretary, he led numerous initiatives designed to make the Defense Department more efficient and business-friendly, an approach that was helpful to defense contractors such as his former employer.

When Mattis became defense secretary in early 2017, he resigned from numerous positions in the private sector — including one at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank — and a handful of charities. When he stepped down from General Dynamics’s board, he promised to divest all stock associated with his seat. He also forfeited stock holdings and options that had not yet vested at the time he rejoined the government, which must have added up to several hundreds of thousands of dollars, based on financial disclosure forms.

Additionally, Mattis pledged that he would not “participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that to my knowledge has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of General Dynamics” as defense secretary until he had divested of his holdings or obtained a written waiver, according to an ethics pledge he submitted at the time.

Mattis also promised not to participate personally or substantially in any matter concerning the now-disgraced Silicon Valley blood testing start-up Theranos, in which he was an investor. According to his ethics pledge at the time, Mattis was not required to divest of his Theranos stock. The company began plans to dissolve in September.

Board members at General Dynamics are given lucrative stock holdings and options, and are often closely involved in major business decisions. Board member responsibilities at General Dynamics include “reviewing, approving and monitoring the company’s business strategies, annual operating plan and significant corporate actions,” according to the company’s corporate governance guidelines. Board members also have responsibility for “advising and counseling management” and ensuring that appropriate ethics policies are in place with respect to the company’s relationship with customers.

Separately, a new provision included in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 prohibits retired officials such as Mattis from engaging in “lobbying activities with respect to the Department of Defense.” Such lobbying activities could include “any oral or written communication … to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official that is made on behalf of a client” with regard to a range of federal policies.

[Almost two years into Trump presidency, Pentagon’s revolving door still spins]

Currently, six of General Dynamics’s 12 board members are former high-ranking government officials. Rudy deLeon served as deputy secretary of defense from 2000 to 2001; retired Navy Adm. Cecil Haney led the U.S. Strategic Command from 2013 to 2016; retired Air Force Gen. Lester Lyles led the Air Force Material Command from 2000 to 2003; retired British Army Gen. Peter Wall was chief of the general staff for the British Army from 2010 to 2014; and chairman and chief executive Novakovic has worked for the CIA, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget.

General Dynamics is not the only company packing its board with former military and government officials. Former deputy undersecretary of defense Bob Work joined Raytheon’s board in 2017, and Nikki Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, joined Boeing’s board this year.

Big tech companies have benefited from the revolving door as well; Amazon recently hired Victor Gavin, the former deputy assistant secretary of the Navy, to assist with its cloud computing business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)"
Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-trump-1637094,"Data from Mike Pompeo’s State Department data suggests Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the Trump administration’s public charge regulation. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo employment & immigration Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department The numbers offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system.

The number of Mexicans refused immigrant visas to the U.S. because they might become dependent on government benefits skyrocketed under President Donald Trump, according to State Department data obtained by POLITICO.

Between Oct. 1 and July 29, the State Department denied 5,343 immigrant visa applications for Mexican nationals on the grounds that the applicants were so poor or infirm that they risked becoming a “public charge,” according to the statistics. That’s up from just seven denials for Mexican applicants in fiscal year 2016, the last full year under former President Barack Obama.

Story Continued Below

The number of public charge denials for applicants from all nations also rose during the past year. Preliminary data obtained by POLITICO shows 12,179 visa rejections on public charge grounds through July 29 — which puts the department on pace to surpass last year’s total. The State Department disqualified only 1,033 people on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016.

Public charge denials have increased in recent years as the State Department has issued fewer immigrant visas overall. Immigrant visas are the first step toward permanent residence in the U.S.

Consular officers approved roughly 534,000 immigrant visas in fiscal year 2018, down from 618,000 two years earlier.

Refused visa applicants are permitted to submit additional evidence to prove their economic self-sufficiency, but the statistics show that only 1,330 Mexican immigrants who applied in previous years reversed a public charge ruling during that period.

Applicants from various other countries — including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti and the Dominican Republic — also saw dramatic increases in denials attributed to the risk that they would consume government benefits.

The State Department statistics offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system. Under the regulation, which is expected to be finalized in the coming days, DHS will adopt a more aggressive public charge analysis to evaluate applications for green cards and visa renewals.

Under the DHS rule, consideration would be given not only to whether an applicant was so poor that they were likely to receive certain U.S. government benefits, but also to whether the applicant received these benefits already.

“It is imposing a tougher standard for working-class people,” said Charles Wheeler, a director with the pro-migrant Catholic Legal Immigration Network.

Wheeler added that the regulation mirrors Trump’s efforts to pass legislation that would reduce legal immigration and favor skilled workers over immigrants with family connections. A Trump-backed Senate bill along those lines drew few supporters in 2017.

The State Department data suggests that Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the public charge regulation. Trump has faced Democratic criticism in recent days over his anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric following a mass shooting in El Paso that killed 22 people, including eight Mexican citizens. Authorities have investigated whether the suspect posted a racist manifesto online that warned of a “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” The language echoed Trump’s own repeated comments about an immigrant “invasion” at the southwest border.

The State Department visa denials were based on statutory language dating to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act (later reaffirmed in 1952 in the Red Scare-inspired McCarren-Walter Act) that says immigrants and visitors to the United States can be turned away if they’re likely to become a public charge after admission. The phrase ""public charge"" isn’t defined in the relevant statutes, but guidance issued in 1999 said it applied to people who were primarily dependent — or likely to become primarily dependent — on cash assistance or long-term, institutionalized care.

The Trump administration is expected to finalize a regulation in the coming days that would expand that definition.

Based on a proposed version released in October, the new standard would consider the use of food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, prescription drug subsidies or Section 8 housing vouchers to make a public charge determination. Immigrants could be denied green cards based on the use of those benefits, or if they were deemed likely to use them in the future.

DHS calculated at the time that roughly 382,000 people seeking to become lawful permanent residents could be subjected to a public charge review each year. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimated that an additional 559,000 people annually could be scrutinized on public charge grounds when applying for immigrant visas from consulates abroad.

People with temporary visas could also be denied for possible benefit use. DHS said in its draft regulation that roughly 518,000 foreigners with non-immigrant visas seeking to extend their stay each year would be required to demonstrate that they haven’t received benefits.

Pro-migrant advocates argue the measure’s reach will be broader, partly because of a chilling effect on immigrant families.

Even while the DHS public charge regulation remained under development, the State Department forged ahead last year with related changes to its public charge standard.

In January 2018, the department revised its Foreign Affairs Manual — which is known to consular officers as the “FAM” — to toughen the guidelines around what triggers a public charge determination for immigrant visa applicants overseas.

Immigration: DACA Illegal Entry The Wall

Specifically, the department reduced the weight of an affidavit of support that many U.S. sponsors must provide to demonstrate that an applicant will not become a taxpayer burden. The new guidance stated that the affidavit should be considered only one factor in a broader test to determine whether a person might use cash assistance or require long-term, institutionalized care.

An affidavit of support previously would have been sufficient to override most public charge determinations, according to immigration lawyers and advocates. But the changes gave a “green light” to State Department officials with more restrictionist views, according to David Strashnoy, a former State Department consular officer.

“It basically opens the door for all sorts of egregious decision-making,” he said.

Following the revision, the number of visa denials based on public charge grounds spiked.

The State Department rejected 12,973 immigrant visa applications over public charge concerns in fiscal 2018, according to the latest statistics. The department turned down just 3,209 applications on those grounds in fiscal 2017 and a mere 1,033 in fiscal 2016.

The 2018 changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual also provided more detailed instructions for how consular officers should consider an applicant’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education and skills when making a public charge determination. Immigration lawyers and advocates contend that changes increased the burden on the applicant.

In addition, the department added new language to the manual tightening standards for applicants to the diversity visa lottery program. The program — a frequent Trump target — offers 50,000 visas annually to immigrants from countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S.

The new provision said consular officers “should review the totality of the [diversity visa] applicant’s circumstances … to determine his ability to become or remain self-sufficient in the United States.”

The statistics obtained by POLITICO include per-country breakdowns of denials that previously were not available to the public. The dataset varies slightly from public charge denials posted in the State Department’s annual visa report. The discrepancy is due to a new department methodology that subtracts any immigrants who overcame a public charge determination in that fiscal year from the annual total.

The city of Baltimore filed a lawsuit in November 2018 that argued the State Department’s foreign affairs manual changes had discouraged immigrants from accessing public benefits to which they were entitled. The city claimed the change discriminated “on the basis of race, national origin, nationality, income, or receipt of public benefits, and was motivated by animus and a desire to effect such discrimination.”

Several immigration lawyers told POLITICO that they had dealt with Mexican clients — some of them long-term U.S. residents but undocumented immigrants — stranded in Mexico because they were denied immigrant visas on public charge grounds.

While Mexico saw the steepest rise in public charge rejections, the number of public charge denials also shot up for visa applications from several other countries.

The State Department denied 1,254 Indian immigrant visa applications in fiscal 2018, a sharp increase over the 268 denials the year before. No Indian applicants were denied on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016, according to the data obtained by POLITICO.

The trend appeared to cool in the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, with only 129 public charge refusals to Indian applicants.

Applicants from Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced a similar increase in denials.

The State Department refused 1,502 Bangladeshi immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018. Consular statistics show no Bangladeshi denials in fiscal 2016. The department turned away 1,246 Pakistani immigrant visa applicants that year, an increase over just two denials in fiscal 2016.

Applicants from Haiti and the Dominic Republic, countries that sit side-by-side on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, also saw public charge rejections shoot up.

The State Department turned away 1,109 Haitian immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018, after no denials two years earlier.

Applicants from the Dominic Republic saw 1,012 immigrant visa denials through the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, up from a single rejection in fiscal 2016.

Some countries experienced little change. Only three Canadian immigrant visa applicants were refused on public charge grounds in fiscal 2018. A single applicant from that country was denied in fiscal 2016."
"Peter Strzok, key figure in Russia probe, sues FBI, DOJ over firing",https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/456399-strzok-key-figure-in-russia-probe-sues-fbi-doj-over-firing,"Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who came under fire for sending disparaging text messages about President Trump Donald John TrumpMSNBC's Geist presses Castro on sharing Trump donors names: These people 'are already being harassed' Marianne Williamson: Message of love 'absolutely' extends to Trump Hickenlooper says Democrats are falling for 'Trump's execrable politics of distraction' MORE and other political figures during the 2016 presidential race, is suing his former employer over his firing, claiming the decision was a result of ""unrelenting pressure"" from Trump.

In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday against the FBI and Justice Department, Strzok's counsel argued that his firing was politically motivated and in violation of two constitutional amendments.

In particular, they argued that he was fired for using his protected political speech under the First Amendment and that the FBI also “deprived” him of his due process under the Fifth Amendment by denying him the right to appeal the decision.

The lawsuit also alleges that unlawful leaks to the press violated the Privacy Act.

""The concerted public campaign to disparage and, ultimately, fire Special Agent Strzok was enabled by the defendants’ deliberate and unlawful disclosure to the media of texts, intended to be private, from an FBI systems of records, in violation of the Privacy Act,” according to the court documents.

Strzok, who was fired in August 2018, argued that his firing was politically motivated because a top FBI executive originally recommended a different, less extreme disciplinary response to his conduct.

FBI Assistant Director Candice Will, who led the Office of Professional Responsibility, initially recommended against firing the agent, instead proposing that he “be demoted and suspended for sixty days without pay,” the court documents read.

“Will’s decision was based upon the facts underlying the charges in the proposed removal, the agency’s schedule of disciplinary offenses, the agency’s record of discipline in comparable circumstances, and upon Strzok’s long and outstanding record of service to the FBI and the country,” the court documents argue, noting that it also reflected a “last chance agreement” that Strzok had accepted.

Nevertheless, Strzok was still fired, and because his firing was “effective immediately,” he was prevented him from appealing the decision to the FBI’s Disciplinary Review Board or any other formal avenue to receive due process.

“The discharge decision was made by Deputy Director David Bowdich, and was the result of unrelenting pressure from President Trump and his political allies in Congress and the media,” the court filing states.

Strzok’s firing came also after Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released a lengthy 500-page report last year that fiercely criticized Strzok for his conduct, saying he displayed a “biased state of mind” during a key phase of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOnetime GOP stronghold in California now has more Democrats than Republicans Conservatives buck Trump over worries of 'socialist' drug pricing Mississippi Republicans head to gubernatorial runoff MORE's email practices.

Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the bureau, sent messages critical of the then-Republican candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential race to then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page. The two were having an extramarital affair at the time.

One of the most explosive revelations from Horowitz's report was a text Strzok sent to Page in which he said they will ""stop"" Trump from becoming president.

Strzok described that text during public testimony before Congress last year as “written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then-candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero.""

Horowitz ultimately said his investigative team found no evidence that any decision made during the course of the investigation was a result of political bias or improper influence. Nonetheless, the report found that those actions cast a cloud over the department and was deeply critical of FBI and Justice Department leadership.

Strzok served both as the No. 2 official on the FBI Clinton probe as well as briefly on special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE’s investigative team. But Mueller promptly removed Strzok from his team after Horowitz's internal review uncovered the critical Trump text messages.

Revelations of the text messages sparked a barrage of attacks from Trump and Republicans, who have alleged that the top brass at the FBI and Justice Department harbored an anti-Trump bias during the 2016 election.

The Department of Justice declined to comment on Strzok's lawsuit.

Activists Say DHS Agents Racially Profiled Drivers Outside Miramar ICE Office,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Manuel Madrid'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/activists-say-dhs-agents-racially-profiled-drivers-outside-of-south-florida-ice-office-11237427,"Federal agents used limited parking outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Miramar as a pretext to racially profile drivers earlier today.

That's according to activists who intervened after they saw officers with the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service (FPS) demand driver's licenses from people of color who had stopped or slowed in no-park zones, and simply waved on white drivers to move their vehicles.

""I was shocked to see them simply letting white people drive off while stopping people of color,"" Maria Bilbao, an organizer with the immigration advocacy group United We Dream, tells New Times. ""They said what they were doing was legal, but I've never seen this sort of thing happen before.""

FPS did not immediately respond to New Times' request for comment.

The Miramar facility is the primary point of access for South Florida immigrants looking to check in with ICE. Lines to enter the facility begin before dawn and sometimes include hundreds of people, yet there's vastly insufficient parking to accommodate such large crowds. The constant flow of cars and pedestrians can make finding a place to park or idle difficult. New Times previously reported that tow truck drivers in the past have circled the lot outside the facility to haul away illegally parked cars.

According to Bilbao, FPS agents were targeting drivers of color who had stopped or slowed in no-park zones. On Twitter, Bilbao posted a video of the incident, in which she can be seen speaking with an FPS agent beside a stopped car. Bilbao is ushered back to the sidewalk by the agents as she asks why they're checking driver's licenses. One agent tells her it's part of their job.

""That's not part of his job,"" replies Carlos Naranjo, a community organizer with New Florida Majority. ""That's never happened before.""

WATCH NOW:



Our organizers at the ICE facility in Miramar, Florida found out that DHS is now checking the driver's licenses of the people driving to drop off their family members at the location. They are mostly stopping people of color. #AbolishICE pic.twitter.com/03o7BRGbCM — United We Dream (@UNITEDWEDREAM) August 7, 2019

Bilbao, along with other immigrant-rights activists, visits the facility every week to provide water and other support to immigrants waiting in line for their appointments with ICE. She says she's been going there for more than two years but had never seen DHS officers target drivers. Naranjo took photos of at least two drivers of color stopped by FPS agents. Bilbao says other activists counted as many as five cars stopped. Once Naranjo began filming the incident, the officers apparently stopped pulling people over.

Mark Myers, a staffer from the office of Miramar Democratic Rep. Cindy Polo, says he drove by the ICE facility to drop off water and was asked by FPS officers to move when he slowed his vehicle.

""I can't say that I wasn't stopped because I was a white guy in a tie. I can't be sure what was on the mind of the officer,"" Myers says. ""But I certainly wasn't asked for any information or identification.""

Another activist, Glenn Rice, responded to one of Bilbao's Facebook posts about the profiling, echoing Myers' experience. ""When I stopped on the side of the road this morning to drop off water, this same 'guard/ICE agent' [sic] tried to be very nice & professional with ME — asked me to 'please pull my car into a parking lot, SIR, if you're going to stay.' He even said thank you to ME!""

Thirteen states offer driver's licenses to undocumented residents. Florida is not one of them. An undocumented person in the Sunshine State could easily end up in deportation proceedings as a result of a traffic stop.

""I was undocumented for 18 years and often had no choice but to drive without a license,"" Bilbao says. ""I know what can happen when you get pulled over while undocumented — it can ruin your life.""

Besides that, the alleged racial profiling occurred outside a place where immigrants show up for legal check-ins with ICE. In other words, immigrants at the Miramar facility are there to comply with the law. Activists claim that ICE agents have routinely used the check-ins as a way to apprehend immigrants without warning, but this is apparently the first time FPS officers have requested documentation from people outside the facility.

The ICE office, located just off Miramar Parkway by I-75, has long been plagued by accusations of poor conditions, including insufficient shade outside and only two functioning toilets to accommodate hundreds of immigrants waiting in line. Activists have compared barricades used to fence immigrants to those used to corral farm animals. Bilbao worries FPS officers might use profiling tactics again when there are no activists present."

Obama urges Americans to reject language from leaders that 'normalizes racist sentiments' in pointed statement,https://www.cnn.com,['Paul Leblanc'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/politics/obama-statement-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio/index.html,"Washing (CNN) Former President Barack Obama on Monday released a pointed statement condemning ""language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders"" that ""normalizes racist sentiments."" The statement, which did not directly name President Donald Trump, follows two mass shootings in the US in the span of 13 hours -- one of which involved a white supremacist suspect.

""We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don't look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people,"" Obama said.

""It's time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much -- clearly and unequivocally,"" he added.

Even amid recent uproars over Trump's racist comments about four Democratic congresswoman and the city of Baltimore, Obama has largely remained silent. But mass shootings are an issue that Obama has long been frustrated by, including multiple massacres during his time in office. He's said the day of the Sandy Hook shooting was the worst of his presidency, and lamented Washington's collective inability to respond meaningfully."

The State Department puts China first on rare earth metals,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-state-department-puts-china-first-on-rare-earth-metals,"HARGEISA, Somaliland — To most Americans, anarchy, intervention, and the Black Hawk Down fiasco define Somalia. By any reasonable metric, the country has not improved much since. Somalia has had the dubious honor to be crowned the world’s most corrupt country by Transparency International for 14 years running. Terrorism is a weekly occurrence , and perhaps even a tool for some Somali politicians.

Somalia largely deserves its reputation. A generation of Somali politicians and clan leaders have siphoned off the billions of dollars which the U.S. government and other outside powers have invested in the country. The national Somali military, built to supplant the country’s patchwork of militias, exists largely on paper. In recent weeks, Somali elders, soldiers, and politicians have lined up to apologize to and swear allegiance to al Shabaab, an extremist group responsible for terrorism both inside and outside Somalia.

Somaliland, the northern third of the country and a former British protectorate, however, is a happy exception. It gained its independence (and U.S. recognition) in 1960, only to forfeit it days later when it entered into a union with the rest of Somalia. It was an unhappy marriage marked by dictatorship in Mogadishu and later genocide against the Somaliland population. Finally, in 1991, Somaliland left the union and reasserted its independence. Today, it is peaceful, stable, and even without international recognition, one of the most democratic countries in Africa. It is the first country in the world, for example, to use biometric iris scans for voter registration.

Alas, the State Department ignores Somaliland and instead operates under the fiction that Somalia works. Like a gambler who believes he can redeem his losses with just one more hand at the blackjack table, it continues to pour money into the country, never mind the historical reverse correlation in Somalia between aid and stability. This fiction and gambler’s addiction increasingly undermine vital U.S. national interests.

Historically, Somaliland’s greatest resource was livestock and, for better or worse, charcoal. Energy companies now explore for gas and oil both in Somaliland and Somalia.

The real strategic asset of Somaliland, however, might be rare earth metals.

Mining is a new industry, but already Somaliland is becoming a resource for the rare elements necessary for modern electronics and cutting-edge technology. China has tried to monopolize rare earth elements both to bolster its own economy and, for strategic reasons, to deny them to the United States.

Here is where the State Department strategy is so narrow minded. Somaliland officials say that Chinese companies are aggressive in seeking mining concessions in Somaliland. Somaliland, which has traditionally been both moderate in its outlook and pro-Western, prefers to work with the United States and Europe. But, in order to maintain the fiction that Mogadishu is a success (even though a half billion dollars each year buys the Somali government control over just a few square blocks in the center of Mogadishu) the U.S. government dissuades American companies from signing separate contracts with authorities in Hargeisa, the Somaliland seat of government.

After all, if the U.S. government does not recognize Somaliland’s legal right to issue contracts, then any American businesses operating in Somaliland are illegally infringing on Somali sovereignty. Any American support for Somaliland, the State Department also insists, would also undermine efforts to stabilize Somalia. Perhaps that makes sense in a sterile State Department boardroom or in the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, but China has no such qualms, and may tighten its rare earth monopoly while American diplomats wring their hands. Adding insult to injury, of course, is that despite the billions of dollars it has received in American assistance over the last decade, the Somali government also awards contracts to the Chinese.

It’s one thing for U.S. diplomats to fight for principle, but to do so absent a sense of vital U.S. national interests or a sense of Horn of Africa realities is counterproductive. Despite all the Trump administration’s rhetoric of America first, both the U.S. embassy in Somalia and the broader U.S. State Department appear effectively to be putting China first.

The Cybersecurity 202: Here's how the Justice Department wants to befriend ethical hackers,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joseph Marks', 'Reporter For The Cybersecurity Newsletter', 'August At Am']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/08/07/the-cybersecurity-202-here-s-how-the-justice-department-wants-to-befriend-ethical-hackers/5d49ace188e0fa1454f801cf/,"THE KEY

The seal of the US Department of Justice on a podium (ERIK S LESSER/EPA-EFE/REX)

LAS VEGAS — The Justice Department's relationship with the cybersecurity research community has historically been tempestuous, but Leonard Bailey is on a mission to improve it.

That's what brings him here, to the BSides cybersecurity conference. The head of the cybersecurity unit of DOJ’s computer crimes division is extending an open invitation today to ethical hackers to air some grievances and offer policy advice, in a talk called: “Let’s Hear from the Hackers: What Should DOJ do Next?”

Bailey wants to ensure hackers are willing to work with government on improving cybersecurity -- instead of staying away because they're suspicious of government.

“It's about figuring out how to make sure that their ability to help us improve [the nation’s] cybersecurity is not taken off the playing field,” Bailey tells me. “They have a valuable resource and they can be helping everyone.”

This marks a drastic change — in terms of both outreach and attitude -- from previous years. Tensions have soared as ethical hackers accused DOJ of being too quick to prosecute them for benign research aimed at improving cybersecurity -- and of not being transparent enough about the rules for what constitutes a digital crime.

Bailey's office has worked for four years to ease some of these tension points, he said, including by helping develop Copyright Office rules, which make it tougher for companies to use copyright laws to scare off ethical hackers from searching for dangerous bugs in their software, and publishing guidance that clarifies when hackers are likely to fall afoul of the nation’s major anti-hacking law, the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

“[Before], we were building a bridge” of trust, he told me. “Now, we’ve developed some strong relationships where we can have policy discussions.”

Bailey’s likely to run into some serious headwinds, though. While a majority of cybersecurity experts surveyed by The Cybersecurity 202 said this week that the relationship between hackers and government officials has gotten better in the last several years, they also pointed out some major points of conflict.

Most ethical hackers strongly oppose Attorney General William P. Barr’s push to stop companies from offering encrypted communication systems that prevent police from accessing communications with a warrant. And they say the Computer Fraud and Abuse act is still used too broadly to punish hackers — with many pointing to the case of Marcus Hutchins, a British security researcher who helped stem the damage from the massive WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 but was charged under the CFAA a few months later for developing and selling malicious software.

Bailey acknowledged the conflict. He joked in a 2016 address that when he first met with ethical hackers at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015 “only half [of the meeting] was being yelled at.” In succeeding years, he says, those conversations have become far less hostile and more productive. Now, he says ethical hackers frequently call him to talk over policy disagreements.

One of the big things Bailey wants to talk with ethical hackers about today is ways they can work with government to help warn young people who are skilled with computers away from criminal hacking or digital vandalism that might land them in trouble with the law.

“Kids who are tech savvy are having earlier and earlier access to valuable tools for learning hard skills like coding, but they may not also be getting information about how to use that power responsibly,” he said.

The Justice Department is examining offering grants for organizations to write ethical hacking curriculum for high schools or community organizations, he said. They’re also looking for ways to reach out to places where they might find tech savvy teens, such as the video gaming community.

But he’s hoping the hacking community will take up the issue, too, and launch its own education efforts.

“It's very difficult for the government to shape a message here, to say ‘hey kids, don't hack.’ That doesn't really have a lot of purchase,” he told me. “So, we’re trying to figure out whether there are ways of leveraging the community to help us with that messaging.”

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: A second election security non-profit has announced it will offer free cybersecurity protections to 2020 presidential campaigns following a May Federal Elections Commission opinion that said non-profits can offer those services without falling afoul of campaign finance laws.

The newly-formed non-profit U.S. CyberDome boasts an all-star board of directors including former Homeland Security chiefs Jeh Johnson and Michael Chertoff and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Defending Digital Democracy, the non-profit that sought the FEC ruling, is run by Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, and Matt Rhoades, Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign manager.

CyberDome will offer services including protection against password thefts and ransomware using a patchwork of different vendors and technologies, founder Joseph Drissel told Tim Starks at Politico.

“It’s not a question of ‘if’ a campaign will be hacked or trolled, it’s a question of ‘when’,” Drissel said in a statement. The group hopes to expand its services to congressional elections over time.

The FEC also gave the greenlight to a private cybersecurity firm, Area 1 Security, to provide “low- to no-cost” protections against phishing attacks to 2020 campaigns in July.

PATCHED: The Department of Justice indicted a 34-year-old Pakistani man for paying more than $1 million in bribes to AT&T workers to plant malware and surveillance software on corporate computers and devices, Forbes’ Thomas Brewster reports.

The malware allowed Muhammad Fahd to collect confidential data that helped him to unlock phones and sell them on the black market for far more than he would have earned for locked phones. Fahd and the employees he bribed unlocked 2 million phones over the five years they ran the scam -- defrauding AT&T of tens of millions of dollars. The malware didn't allow Fahd access to consumer data, Brewster reported.

Fahd, who was extradited to the U.S. from Hong Kong this month, faces up to 20 years in jail.

PWNED: Senate Democrats’ campaign fundraising arm left a server containing the email addresses of 6.2 million Americans exposed, researchers told TechCrunch's Zack Whittaker. The decade-long exposure highlights how campaigns are collecting more and more data about their donors but not sufficiently improving their security at the same time.

Researchers at the security firm UpGuard found the unprotected data hosted on Amazon cloud storage without a password in July. After tracing the data back to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, researchers notified the organization and the DSCC secured the data. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

The data was stored in files dated to 2010 that included ""Clinton"" in the name, suggesting campaign campaign staff may have collected the data during fundraising efforts for Hillary Clinton's 2010 Senate run, Whittaker reports. DSCC denied the claim to TechCrunch but did not disclose how it collected the data or if the data had been accessed while exposed. The server contained private and government email addresses.

""If political data can be exposed for 10 years, the risk created by that data has an unknown half-life,"" researchers at UpGuard wrote in a blog post. Researchers could not determine if hackers accessed any of the data while it was unsecured.

""A spreadsheet from nearly a decade ago that was created for fundraising purposes was removed in compliance with the stringent protocols we now have in place,"" DSCC spokesperson Stewart Boss wrote in an email.

Correction: This article originally misstated what data the exposed Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee server contained. It contained private and government emails.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents executed search warrants at food processing plants across Mississippi Wednesday, resulting in the arrest of 680 people.

They occurred in small towns near Jackson with a workforce made up largely of Latino immigrants, including Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastapol. About 600 agents fanned out across the plants involving several companies, surrounding the perimeters to prevent workers from fleeing.

Matthew Albence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's acting director, told The Associated Press that the raids could be the largest such operation thus far in any single state.

In an emailed statement Wednesday morning, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations special agents are executing federal search warrants today at multiple locations across the state of Mississippi as part of a coordinated operation with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi pursuant to ongoing HSI administrative and criminal investigations.”

In a second statement, Hurst said via email, ""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country.""

Bryan Cox, ICE spokesperson, said everyone taken into custody and detained Wednesday will be processed but ""not everyone is going to be (permanently) detained.""

""You are going to have persons released,"" he said. ""ICE makes custody determination on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of their circumstances.""

The names of the plants has not been publicly released by ICE officials. However, reporters were on scene at the Koch Foods Inc. processing plant in Morton. Another included the Peco Chicken Processing Plant in Canton.

In an emailed statement, Peco Foods Inc. confirmed raids took place at three of their facilities — Canton, Bay Springs and Sebastopol. The company is ""fully cooperating"" with authorities, the statement read.

This story has been corrected since originally published to indicate the warrants were being executed on Wednesday.

"USDA may have violated law in controversial office relocation decision, inspector general says",https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/usda-relocation-inspector-general/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The US Agriculture Department's inspector general has concluded the department may have violated the law when deciding to relocate two offices from the Washington, DC, area.

USDA has justified its decision to relocate the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture offices to the Kansas City area for both financial reasons and to put the researchers closer to the agricultural heartland.

But it is seen by critics as a swipe at the agency's scientific expertise and was largely unwelcome with agency employees . Those offices unionized, and around 70% told union organizers they would not make the move. Some physically turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a public meeting where he addressed the move.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Friday that the move is part of the administration's approach to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.

""More than half the people quit. Now, it's nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,"" he said. ""What a wonderful way to sort of streamline government and do what we haven't been able to do for a long time.""

Interior took notes from FBI while developing controversial FOIA policy,https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456377-interior-took-notes-from-fbi-while-developing-controversial-foia,"The Interior Department took notes from the FBI, which handles reams of classified material and is known as a slower responder to public records requests, while developing its controversial policy for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, according to emails reviewed by The Hill.

Internal emails obtained through a FOIA request by Earthjustice and shared with The Hill show that Interior employees were eager to talk to FBI staff who oversaw FOIA requests as it sought to deal with its own mounting public records requests.

“I understand from my discussions with the US Attorney’s Office in D.C. that the FBI’s FOIA program and strategy in FOIA litigation is pretty much the 'gold standard,’ ” Rachel Spector, an official with Interior’s Office of the Solicitor, wrote to an unnamed FBI official on April 14, 2018.

“Sorry to be so persistent, but we are scrambling to get our arms around a significant surge in FOIA requests and accompanying litigation,” she wrote to another FBI official seeking information on their procedures.

The emails show Interior was particularly interested in the FBI’s “500-page per month policy,” under which the FBI only releases 500 pages of requested material to each requester per month. That rule has routinely been challenged in courts with mixed success by advocacy groups who argue it skirts FOIA law.

The “500-page per month policy” did not become a part of Interior’s new FOIA process, but critics say the discussions show the lengths to which the department went to try to find ways to not have to respond quickly to requests.

“I can’t imagine any reason for adopting the FBI’s approach other than it seems like a slow enough rate for them to be happy with processing records,” said Jeffrey Light, a FOIA specialist attorney.

The emails also show Interior reached out to officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while it was working on its policy.

Both the EPA and Interior in 2018 were actively working to draft new FOIA policies under President Trump Donald John TrumpMSNBC's Geist presses Castro on sharing Trump donors names: These people 'are already being harassed' Marianne Williamson: Message of love 'absolutely' extends to Trump Hickenlooper says Democrats are falling for 'Trump's execrable politics of distraction' MORE. Interior ultimately submitted its draft policy in December 2018. EPA submitted its finalized policy without a public comment period at the end of June.

An Interior Department official said the policies were drafted in a way to “increase the value of the services we provide to the American people.”

“As part of the Department’s efforts to improve its FOIA program, we consulted other federal agencies to better understand their practices including training, technology, and processing. We are committed to increasing transparency and improving our ability to meet our statutory obligations with an ever-increasing volume of FOIA requests,” Interior spokeswoman Molly Block told The Hill in a statement.

The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its interactions with the Interior Department.

Thomas Cmar, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said Interior’s use of the FBI as a potential model for handling FOIA requests was troubling because “the FBI has a long and storied history of lack of transparency.”

ADVERTISEMENT

“I think it says a lot about Interior’s point of view on transparency that they are looking for examples on efforts trying to clamp down on transparency as models for how the agency should adopt its procedures,” he said.

The FBI provided Interior with full texts of one of the court cases connected to the 500-page rule’s proceedings, writing: “The Appeal Court concluded the FBI’s policy was not in violation of the FOIA; the policy is a non-obstructionist; the policy serves to promote efficient responses to a larger number of requesters.”

Light, who has represented clients challenging the FBI’s FOIA rule, said he understood Interior’s interest in the FBI policy even though it was a bit like comparing “apples and oranges” given the often classified nature of FBI information.

“I can certainly understand from an agency’s perspective why they would want to have a cap on how many pages they want to do,” he said. “Because then, if there is a request that is large, you can forward the requester to be in a position to give up documents they really want or having to wait an inordinate amount of time to get them. It gives them a lot of leverage.”

The emails show Interior officials were interested in learning more about the EPA’s recent reorganization of FOIA request handling to a central office in Washington, D.C.

EPA in April 2018 quietly moved its national FOIA office to its Office of General Counsel, a big change that meant requests went to a general office rather than specific EPA bureaus.

Critics say the shift made EPA political appointees — and not career officials — the first gatekeepers for FOIA requests.

The EPA’s new policy has been challenged in the courts by a number of environmental groups over its lack of transparency and also spurred a bipartisan group of senators at the end of July to introduce a FOIA reform bill.

Interior set up meetings with EPA officials to discuss the rules after they learned of them.

“FYI,” wrote Cindy Cafaro, an officer in Interior’s FOIA policy office, as she forwarded an internal EPA press release about the National Freedom of Information Act office. The April 25, 2018, email was sent to Juliette Lillie, director of Interior’s Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, and Robert Howarth, the director of congressional affairs.

Four months later, Interior’s acting solicitor Edward Keable and EPA's acting FOIA director Timothy Epp held a meeting.

“Thank you again for taking the time this afternoon to meet with us,” Keable wrote Epp on Aug. 24. In the email, Keable suggested further discussing topics at a second meeting, scheduled for Aug. 28.

“What is your experience with and how do you minimize false positives? How do you manage quality control?” Keable asked Epp in the Aug. 24 email, referring to ways the agency could minimize the chances of releasing incorrectly identified documents from FOIA request match search results.

Cmar said the interactions were troubling because “we’ve seen serious abuses of the process at both agencies under this administration.”

Another internal email suggested that Interior Secretary David Bernhardt personally requested learning more details about EPA’s FOIA process. Bernhardt was deputy secretary at the time.

In August, an email sent from Lillie to acting Interior Solicitor Daniel Jorjani and Hubbel Relat, a senior counselor at Interior, said a “David” had asked staff to reach out to EPA.

“This morning we met with David on FOIA. He asked us to reach out to EPA to learn about their management processes, including clearing out backlog, accountability, management, staffing, tools, etc. and how they made the changes. Would it be possible for you to reach out within the next week?” Lillie wrote. “We are on a tight time frame to provide some additional guidance back to David. I am happy to discuss further with you, when you are available.”

Interior did not respond to a specific question about Bernhardt’s involvement.

The EPA told The Hill that it will “continue to work with all federal partners to share best practices for FOIA responses.” The agency did not comment on its communications with the Interior Department regarding FOIA policies.

Interior’s final draft FOIA policy submitted in December did not include EPA’s centralization plan.

Interior did not respond to questions about why the two policies were not included and whether it is looking to incorporate them.

Interior's draft FOIA policy has been criticized for including what’s known as an “awareness review,” which allows senior political appointees to review public documents referencing them before release. Critics warn the practice can slow the dissemination of public information and gives officials undue authority to potentially influence the withholding of documents.

Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenConservatives buck Trump over worries of 'socialist' drug pricing Interior took notes from FBI while developing controversial FOIA policy Trump casts uncertainty over top intelligence role MORE (D-Ore.) last week placed a hold on Jorjani’s nomination to be the official Interior solicitor, citing concerns over his work on Interior’s FOIA policy and a lack of candor about his involvement while testifying to Congress.

Interior’s Inspector General is separately investigating the merits of the Interior FOIA policy.

“I am writing to ask you that you include in the scope of your investigation the role Deputy Solicitor Daniel Jorjani played in establishing DOI’s ‘supplemental’ FOIA review policy or any awareness he may have had of the policy’s existence before his confirmation hearing,” Wyden last week wrote to the Inspector General's Office.

“I believe your investigation may be the best hope of uncovering information critical to a possible DOJ investigation before the Senate moves forward with his confirmation vote,” he wrote.

DeVos sued by students seeking college loan relief,https://www.freep.com,"['Andrea Perez Balderrama', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.freep.com/story/news/education/2019/08/07/devos-sued-students-college-loan-relief/1942523001/,"CLOSE

Former students of predatory, for-profit colleges are suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, claiming the U.S. Department of Education intentionally refused to process their applications for federal loan relief.

According to the Huffington Post, DeVos halted the implementation of the Borrower Defense to Repayment regulation in June 2017, leaving the plaintiffs of the lawsuit, and many other students who were not listed, in crippling debt and without a clear path to financial recovery.

""It's time to take a step back and make sure these rules achieve their purpose: helping harmed students,"" Education Secretary DeVos said in a statement to CNN.

Alicia Davis a former student at Florida Metropolitan University, now Everest University, attempted to pursue a criminal justice degree from the university in 2006, oblivious to the fact that it was taking out loans in her behalf.

The school never made the cost of her education transparent, instead telling her not to worry, that everything would be covered by federal aid, grants and scholarships, said the Huffington Post.

Davis had to transfer schools after two years when FMU stopped communicating with her. She decided to go to the University of Central Florida, and when she finished her degree, she had accrued about $100,000 in debt, said the Post.

When Davis learned she couldn't claim her debt from Florida Metropolitan University back, she decided to sue DeVos. But she is not the only student that has been affected by predatory universities taking out loans in their behalf.

“Literally 160,000-plus people cannot move on with their life because of this non-decision by Besty DeVos,” Davis told the Huffington Post.

The lawsuit, filed in June, claims DeVos is violating the students' rights by not responding to their requests promptly while being aware of the harm the debt is causing.

“We’re suing Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education to hold them accountable and protect students across the country,” said Project on Predatory Student Lending Director Toby Merrill in a news release.

"10-year yield drops under 1.6%, 30-year yield nears record low as collapse in rates accelerates",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/us-treasury-bonds-china-sets-the-yuan-below-expectations.html,"Investors again rushed for the safety of government bonds and dumped stocks on Wednesday, exacerbating the August exodus away from risk assets as traders around the world settled in for a U.S.-China trade war without an end in sight.

The flight to safety sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note — used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans — falling to a low of 1.595%, the lowest since autumn 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond bottomed around 2.12%, near its all-time low reached in 2016. Yields pared some of their declines later in the session, but held steady near multiyear lows.

The 10-year Treasury rate is about 40 basis points below its level one month ago, down more than 35 basis points in August alone and representing a sizable move for the relative stable U.S. bond market. The yield ended July above 2%.

Bond yields move inversely to their prices; yields fall when investors demand Treasurys.

The head-turning moves in the bond market weren't isolated to the United States, however, as rates in Germany and the United Kingdom clinched all-time lows across the board on Wednesday.

The yield on the German 10-year bund hit a new all-time low of -0.6% while the 30-year bund also hit a record at -0.137%. The 2-year German yield touched -0.849%.

The U.K. 10-year and 30-year yields both hit record lows at 0.432% and 1.081%, respectively."
Trump administration freezes foreign aid funds pending review,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Nicole Gaouette']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/omb-state-department-usaid-letter/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration has put a temporary hold on the majority of congressionally approved foreign aid funds, pending a review by the State Department and the US Agency for International Development. Critics say the move undercuts Congress and fear that it is another attempt by the administration to cancel aid programs that advocates see as vital to US interests.

The Office of Management and Budget informed the two agencies in a letter Saturday that unobligated funds would be frozen until ""three business days after"" State and USAID provide an accounting of how much remains in specific accounts and how the funds are being spent. Those funds expire on September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was out of the country when the letter, addressed to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, was sent. Congress was on recess.

A USAID official told CNN the funding amounts to between $2 billion and $4 billion.

The accounts specified in the letter include funding for international organizations, international peacekeeping, international narcotics control and law enforcement, global health, development assistance, foreign military and assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia.

The Washington Post was the first to report on the letter.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""if an agency can't even tell us how much money is in the account, I have no confidence in their ability to tell me where the money is going to go to.""

Based on the responses from the agencies, OMB may propose to Congress canceling the appropriated funds, which is known as rescission, or reprogramming them.

The USAID official told CNN that ""it is pretty clear they will try to rescind the money."" That official noted that OMB made a similar attempt last year but Congress rejected the move.

The review will take several days, the official said, and it is expected that the tally will be sent to OMB by early next week at the latest. However, the official noted that if OMB decides to maintain the freeze in an effort to cancel any of the foreign aid, it could take a while to get the funding streams open because it would require action from Congress.

""It'll be a long process,"" said the official.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""the accounts that are being looked at include programs that many over the years have considered wasteful like ones that would pay for solar panels in the Caribbean, a space program in Pakistan, soccer camps in Guatemala, and foreign aid to countries that aren't in the best interest of US foreign policy.""

Liz Schrayer, the president of the US Global Leadership Council, condemned OMB's action as ""reckless and irresponsible.""

""These are programs that are in our interest,"" she told CNN. ""If we take ourselves off the playing field, we do it at our own peril. These are programs that we are using to advance our economic and our security interests and I think it is really surprising that the administration is pulling back on what is less than 1% of our entire budget when there are such great threats in the world.""

In a statement, Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called the move a ""dangerous action"" and vowed to reverse any rescission or reprogramming.

""This Administration's contempt for Congress is astounding. When Congress decides how much we spend on foreign assistance, it isn't a suggestion. It's the law, backed up by the constitution,"" the New York Demcrat wrote in a statement. ""President Trump and Secretary Pompeo should follow the law and stop playing politics with our foreign affairs budget. If they move ahead with this plan, I'll use the full power of the Foreign Affairs Committee to reverse their efforts and to demand answers about why this Administration seems determined to ignore the will Congress and undermine American leadership.""

The State Department and USAID referred CNN to OMB for comment.

""It is incumbent on all Federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress. In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely,"" OMB spokesperson Rachel Semmel said in a statement."
"AT&T employees bribed more than $1M to unlock phones, install malware, DOJ says",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/att-employees-bribed-1m-unlock-phones-install-malware/story?id=64802367,"The Department of Justice has unsealed charges against a man who allegedly paid AT&T ""insiders"" more than a million dollars over five years to unlock more than two million cell phones ""fraudulently,"" allowing buyers to avoid using the company as a provider.

""The object ... was to sell members of the public the resulting ability fraudulently to unlock phones, so that members of the public could stop using AT&T wireless services and therefore deprive AT&T of the stream of payments it was owed under customers' service contracts and installment plans,"" an indictment unsealed Monday in the Western District of Washington state, said.

Between 2013 and 2017, Muhamad Fahd a 34-year-old from Pakistan allegedly bribed AT&T employees at a call center in Bothell, Washington, to ""use their network credentials and exceed their authorized access to AT&T's computers to submit large numbers of fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests on behalf of the conspiracy and to install malware and unauthorized hardware on AT&T's systems,"" according to the indictment.

One employee was allegedly paid $428,500 over the five-year scheme,

Fahd, who was extradited through Hong Kong, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, four counts of wire fraud, two counts of accessing a protected computer in furtherance of fraud, two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, and four counts of violating the Travel Act.

DOJ says the scheme cost the company millions and resulted in millions of phones being removed from AT&T service. A phone is usually locked to a carrier, like AT&T, according to Apple, and unlocking a phone means disconnecting or ""unlocking"" from one carrier, and then the phone can be used by anyone.

It is not the same as merely using a passcode to unlock a cellphone.

""We have been working closely with law enforcement since this scheme was uncovered to bring these criminals to justice and are pleased with these developments,"" AT&T said in a statement to ABC News, and a spokesperson added that this incident did not compromise customer information or affect any customers.

The AT&T insiders, allegedly planted malware on computers that allowed Fahd to log into AT&T's ""internal protected computers under false pretenses and to process fraudulent and authorized unlock request,"" from a remote location, the indictment says.

DOJ alleges that in addition to a malware, the AT&T employees were bribed to also use their physical access points to install hardwired devices to give Fahid remote access to internal ""protected computers,"" so he could study the company's processes.

Much like the malware, the credentials used to unlock phones belonged to actual AT&T employees, DOJ says.

""This arrest illustrates what can be achieved when the victim of a cyber attack partners quickly and closely with law enforcement,” Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in a statement. “When companies that fall prey to malware work with the Department of Justice, no cybercriminal—no matter how sophisticated their scheme—is beyond our reach.”

The indictment shows a pattern over the course of those five years, after getting caught by AT&T investigators in 2013, the employees that were helping Fahd left the company, but he still recruited more people to conspire with him, DOJ says.

""Fahd ... began programming hardware devices designed to facilitate unauthorized access to AT&T's internal protected network for the purpose of processing authorized unlock requests,"" the indictment reads.

Once ""perfecting"" the devices, Fahd gave them to the AT&T employees he was bribing and they plugged them in to the internal network ""without authorization to facilitate the unlocking of phones.""

Fahd instructed employees to get burner phones and emails to communicate with him and to create shell companies to receive payments, the Department of Justice said.

At the same time, DOJ alleges Fahd was working a list of people ""who operated businesses that offered unlocking services to customers for a fee.""

Fahd would help people who were trying to get out of their AT&T contract, he would get a phone's IMEI, what are like serial numbers and have the AT&T employees unlock it .

Another man, who is now deceased, responsible for paying the bribes and gathering IMEI numbers, was also charged."
Homeland Security chief calls for more resources to fight domestic terrorism after report highlights shift in funding,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/el-paso-shooting-homeland-security-kevin-mcaleenan-resources-domestic-terrorism-report-highlights-funding/,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan responded to a report Tuesday that an initiative focused on targeted violence and terrorism prevention has about a quarter of the staff and an eighth of the budget of a similar program in the Obama administration. ""We need to invest more — no question,"" McAleenan said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning.""

""I've asked Congress for an out-of-cycle budget request to help bolster it and increase our reach and capability. But it doesn't cover the level and scope of effort across the Department of Homeland Security enterprise,"" McAleenan said, adding the Secret Service reaches out to communities about what threat indicators to look out for and the department provides active shooter training to cities around the country.

There have been more than 250 mass shootings so far this year in the U.S., more than the number of days in the year thus far. At least 31 people were killed and scores were hurt in two mass shootings last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

The DHS chief said ideally he'd like to triple the staff available to better address the rise in attacks and ""coordinate the intelligence side of it at the headquarters level as well as investing in those grants and efforts that are going to help communities prepare for these kind of incidents.""

McAleenan said his agency is acting aggressively to address mass shootings after President Trump gave his agency clear marching orders to locate the root cause of these events.

""I've also directed a surge of all of our training and preparedness assets on a risk basis to communities across the country based on what we know,"" McAleenan said. He said DHS had also established an advisory council and created task forces to develop a better understanding of these attacks across the country.

In El Paso, some members of the Hispanic community suggested Mr. Trump's rhetoric has contributed toward acts of hatred. Asked about the president's rhetoric, McAleenan said, ""I think we've got a responsibility to call out hate in all of its forms, and white supremacist extremism is a critical element that we're trying to address. I think the president was very clear on that yesterday.""

In a nationally televised address Monday on the shootings, the president said the gunman was consumed by racist hate, and Mr. Trump condemned white supremacy. He also blamed mental illness and hate for the attacks, not guns.

McAleenan's comments come just after the FBI issued a new warning about domestic terror threats, saying ""violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.""

The DHS chief agreed with that assessment, saying over the last two years, a ""number of their investigations are racially motivated and within that category the majority are white-supremacist-extremist motivated.""

Meanwhile, the Justice Department said it was treating the El Paso shooting as domestic terrorism after the 21-year old suspect, who is accused of killing at least 22 people, allegedly wrote a racist essay in which he denounced the increasing Hispanic population in Texas.

McAleenan said that the Texas shooting hit home for him because members of the Customs and Border Patrol agency, which is a part of DHS, were in the Walmart where the shooting happened.

""We actually had one of our leaders, a port director ... in the Walmart during the attack. She responded and provided lifesaving assistance to one of the injured victims and just tremendously proud of her and her response,"" McAleenan said."

A federal watchdog challenged the Trump administration’s authority to move two USDA science agencies out of Washington, in a report issued a few days after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, praised the move for encouraging federal scientists to quit their jobs.

The plan to relocate the two agencies from the District to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs.

“This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

In his keynote speech at the Republican Party’s black-tie-optional Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina on Friday, Mulvaney seemed to celebrate the attrition at the agencies. “You’ve heard about ‘drain the swamp.’ What you probably haven’t heard is what we are actually doing. I don’t know if you saw the news the other day, but the USDA just tried to move, or did move, two offices out of Washington, D.C.,"" he said.

As the crowd clapped, Mulvaney continued: “Yes, you can applaud that one. That’s what we’ve been talking about doing. Guess what happened? Guess what happened? More than half the people quit.

“It’s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,” Mulvaney said. “I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I’ve tried . . . By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government, and do what we haven’t been able to do for a long time.”

Trump officials are planning additional shake-ups and exoduses from Washington. By 2020, more than 80 percent of the headquarters staff at the Bureau of Land Management will be moved west of the Rocky Mountains, the Interior Department told lawmakers in July. The Trump administration also wants to break up the Office of Personnel Management and split 5,500 workers among three other departments.

J. David Cox Sr., president of American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the two USDA agencies, said Mulvaney’s comments confirmed the union’s concerns. “The administration’s decision to transfer hundreds of USDA jobs from D.C. isn’t about helping federal employees do their jobs better or delivering better services to the American taxpayer,” Cox said in a statement. “Their goal is to drive out hard-working and dedicated civil servants and silence the parts of the agencies’ research that the administration views as inconvenient.” A study from ERS, for instance, one of the agencies targeted for the move, showed that a $1.5 trillion tax bill signed by Trump offered few, if any, benefits to low-income farmers.

Congress questioned whether USDA has the legal authority to move the agencies. The department has this power, according to the inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the watchdog group said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) called the inspector general report “very troubling” said it confirms “suspicions that the secretary does not have the authority to proceed with this relocation.”

G. William Hoagland, a vice president at the D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, predicted that the failure to get congressional approval “will certainly set in motion legal challenges” from the union to halt the move “until either the courts or Congress act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek approval from a congressional committee.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

This report has been updated.

New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals',https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456361-new-mexico-says-epa-abandoned-state-in-fight-against-toxic-forever,"New Mexico’s Democratic governor is pushing back against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to help the state fight contamination from “forever chemicals” spread by a military base.

The EPA responded Tuesday that it cannot let ""short-term litigation posturing"" interfere with its mission to protect human and environmental health.

Lujan Grisham’s letter is in reference to a class of chemicals abbreviated as PFAS, cancer-linked substances used in a variety of nonstick products and firefighting foam relied on by the military and airports.

PFAS are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment.

The letter, first reported by Politico, is the latest example of frustrations from states in getting the military to work with local leaders in cleaning up contamination.

Some of the blame has been levied against the EPA after suspicions the agency weakened its own PFAS regulations to help the military avoid what could be a $2 billion cleanup bill.

Lawmakers, however, have worked to strengthen the military’s PFAS culpability, including measures in the National Defense Authorization Act to force the military to work with states to clean up contamination.

A measure from Sen. Tom Udall Thomas (Tom) Stewart UdallNew Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' Democrats introduce constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United House passes bill requiring CBP to enact safety, hygiene standards MORE (D-N.M.) included in the House bill would require the military to provide clean water to farms contaminated by PFAS.

Udall was motivated by the plight of a New Mexico dairy farmer who euthanized 4,000 of his cows after the milk they produced tested positive for high levels of PFAS. That farm, located near a military base, caught the attention of Food and Drug Administration researchers in documenting the spread of PFAS from water to food.

New Mexico sued the Air Force for PFAS contamination in March, and Lujan Grisham’s letter criticizes EPA for reneging on a promise from Wheeler to help the state “with legal and technical assistance in a confidential manner.”

“Providing fact sheets and offering webinars are not meaningful,” she wrote.

In responding to request for comment from The Hill, the EPA pointed to a July letter from the agency’s top lawyer and assistant administrator that said EPA is not permitted to bring judicial action against another executive branch agency.

It goes on to list actions EPA has taken to assist New Mexico, including providing fact sheets and webinars along with attending meetings and calls.

But a separate Friday letter from New Mexico Environment Department head James Kenney to another EPA office disputes that reasoning, arguing that “EPA is unrestricted from taking administrative enforcement actions against federal agencies under its controlling acts.”

The EPA responded to that letter Tuesday, saying its work with New Mexico should not be disparaged.

""If the state has not found our assistance useful, that has not been communicated as we have worked jointly on this issue,"" the agency wrote to the governor, adding that the state's letter ""has the potential to miscommunicate to the public the truth of the federal-state collaboration.""

New Mexico pushed back against the Tuesday letter after it was first reported by The Hill.

""EPA suggests the concerns public officials have for the health and safety of New Mexicans and their environment amount to ‘litigation posturing,’"" Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. ""EPA’s disconnect between what has been offered and what New Mexico needs demonstrates a lack of understanding of what our rural New Mexico communities are facing. The Attorney General and the Environment Department will continue to push on behalf of our communities until PFAS is no longer a threat.""

The Department of Defense did not respond to request for comment.

New Mexico is not alone in its frustration with the EPA or the military. Last month 22 attorneys general wrote a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to compel action from the two agencies.

SC officials press for $200 million fines against Energy Department over plutonium,https://www.postandcourier.com,"['Colin Demarest Cdemarest Aikenstandard.Com', 'Colin Demarest', 'Thad Moore', 'Book']",,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/news/sc-officials-press-for-million-fines-against-energy-department-over/article_a25b8ed4-b86e-11e9-bc7b-6f70c1d0e6a1.html,"About one month after South Carolina disclosed that settlement negotiations with the federal government had collapsed, the state is again urging a federal court to swiftly grant it a multimillion-dollar payout related to plutonium stored at the Savannah River Site, a sprawling nuclear reserve south of Aiken.

South Carolina's legal team, led by Attorney General Alan Wilson, on July 31 asked the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for a $200 million summary judgment in its favor, arguing money is and has been available for it.

The amount sought represents two years of fines levied against the U.S. Department of Energy for not removing weapons-grade plutonium from the Savannah River Site.

The South Carolina team said it had previously identified ""multiple"" sources for the payout, and Congress never prohibited the Energy Department from completing the payments.

Federal law mandated — beginning Jan. 1, 2016 — that DOE pay South Carolina $1 million for each day, up to 100 days per year, that the department failed to process plutonium at its Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility or get 1 metric ton of the material out of the state.

The MOX facility was designed to convert plutonium into fuel for commercial nuclear power plants, but it was still unfinished when DOE axed the project last year after more than a decade of work and billions of dollars spent. The department ""chose to not remove the defense plutonium, thereby obligating it to provide the"" payments, according to South Carolina's 10-page filing.

In sharp contrast to the Palmetto State's position, the Energy Department last summer argued it could not disburse the millions of dollars because funds for it were not in place.

""Because the United States is not liable in the absence of available appropriations, the court must dismiss the complaint,"" one of the federal government's court filings reads.

About 12 metric tons of surplus plutonium was kept at the site as of mid-May, according to a National Nuclear Security Administration official. Only some of that was bound for MOX. A majority of the plutonium meant for MOX never reached the site, the same NNSA official said.

South Carolina and the federal government had been in the negotiation process for months to resolve the dispute over the fines.

An impasse was recognized near the end of June, when the state's legal team said the U.S. Department of Justice wasn't engaging with them and had only provided a single ""lowball"" counteroffer."
No-win situation: Defense secretary to referee JEDI war cloud deal after Trump's Amazon attack,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Ben Wolfgang']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/6/mark-esper-referees-pentagon-jedi-war-cloud-deal-a/,"Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper took office last month with a land mine waiting on his desk: the massive Pentagon “war cloud” computing contract that has left him in a no-win situation.

Awarding the decadelong, $10 billion deal to front-runner Amazon likely will infuriate President Trump, who has made no secret of his disdain for the online retailing giant and last month vowed to take a “very strong look” at the bidding process.

But upending the cloud contract, which has been a top priority inside the Pentagon for years and which high-ranking military officers portray as a national security priority, would frustrate Defense Department officials and represent a rocky start for Mr. Esper, who was confirmed to the post just two weeks ago.

Insiders say the newly minted Pentagon chief, who announced last week that he would launch a formal review of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, will try to thread a needle between the opposing sides. The result, they say, could be a tweaked contract that may satisfy Mr. Trump while maintaining the momentum of one of the Defense Department’s most ambitious technological initiatives in decades.

“Given what the president has said, I think he has to do something different. But it might not have to be a lot,” said Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former official in the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget. “The president has a tendency to complain … and then you renegotiate and it’s a little different, and all of the sudden it’s the greatest in the world.

“I don’t see a root-and-branch change here,” Mr. Cancian added. “They’ve been building to this for so long it would be hard to step back and throw it out and completely start over.”

The Pentagon says Mr. Esper, who is in the midst of his first international trip since his confirmation, was simply exercising due diligence in taking a fresh look at a contract with massive, long-term implications for his department.

“Keeping his promise to members of Congress and the American public, Secretary Esper is looking at the [JEDI] program,” Elissa Smith, Department of Defense spokeswoman, told The Washington Times. “No decision will be made on the program until he has completed his examination.”

The JEDI contract, originally scheduled to be awarded this month, would cover the storage and processing of huge amounts of classified Pentagon data, and the winner would be linked in an unprecedented high-tech partnership with the U.S. military. The cloud, its proponents say, would enable the immediate sharing of data to battlefields around the world and would greatly aid the U.S. military in virtually everything it does.

Only two companies, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, remain in the bidding. Oracle Corp. and IBM expressed interest in the original Pentagon proposal request, and Oracle has emerged as one of the most vociferous critics of the JEDI process.

Amazon, which holds a $600 million cloud contract for the CIA, was long viewed as the front-runner for the JEDI contract, but critics say the entire bidding process was marred by conflicts of interest. Pentagon officials are suspected of working behind the scenes with Amazon and structuring the contract in a way that favors the company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper that has been critical of the president.

Pentagon officials have vehemently denied claims of improper handling of the bidding process. A federal judge last month tossed complaints from Oracle, which argued that the process was rigged to favor Amazon Web Services.

Negotiating the politics

Although the Pentagon has weathered the storm of legal challenges, the politics around JEDI have complicated the situation for the president and Mr. Esper.

Some Republicans have urged the White House to intervene and demand changes to the contract. Specifically, they contend that JEDI should be renegotiated at a lower price and that, as Oracle has argued, the Pentagon should split the contract among several firms rather than using a winner-take-all approach.

Mr. Trump seems to have taken those arguments to heart.

“I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” Mr. Trump told reporters last month. “And I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what’s going on because I have had very few things where there’s been such complaining.”

But the JEDI contract dispute does not follow neat partisan lines.

A day after Mr. Trump went public with his doubts about JEDI, Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, and three other Republican committee members wrote a letter imploring Mr. Trump not to get involved.

“We believe that it is essential for our national security to move forward as quickly as possible with the award and implementation of this contract,” said the Republican House members, noting that their committee had conducted oversight of the JEDI contract from the beginning.

“While it is understandable that some of the companies competing for the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of the finalists, further unnecessary delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract,” the letter said.

But just days after the president’s comments, Mr. Esper revealed he was launching a review of the contract. It is unclear exactly how long the review will take or precisely what Mr. Esper may try to change, though he denied getting explicit orders from Mr. Trump.

“I need to make sure that the cloud that we build … that the process was done fairly, properly, it was competitively bid, and all those things, because I have a responsibility to the taxpayers to be a good steward,” he told reporters over the weekend. “I was not directed to do it. Again, I’m looking at all the concerns I’ve heard from members of Congress, both parties, both sides of the Hill. I’ve heard from people from the White House as well.”

Democratic lawmakers fear that Mr. Esper is succumbing to pressure from the White House. In a letter to the secretary this week, Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, and Sen. Jack Reed, Rhode Island Democrat, railed against any political interference that could compromise the bidding process.

“There are already built-in mechanisms for independent review of potential conflicts of interest — some of which have already been used in the JEDI initiative,” the senators said. “We appreciate your desire to review this initiative as you take on your new role as secretary, but we urge you to resist political pressures that might negatively affect the implementation of sound acquisition practices and of the cloud strategy.”

Analysts say Mr. Esper could try to reduce the contract’s length, negotiate a better price, split JEDI among multiple companies or take other steps to modify the contract at the margins but maintain the overall agreement and implement it quickly.

Should White House officials try to elbow Amazon out of the deal entirely, the secretary would likely push back.

“The source selection is a sacred process, and it’s protected by statute. The president cannot interfere with that,” Mr. Cancian said. “I think Esper would see that as a red line.”

"At the US Education Department, applications for loan forgiveness languish",https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/under-betsy-devos-defrauded-students-find-it-hard-to-get-rid-of-debt.html,"When Morgan Marler's 5-year-old daughter, Lilian, asks her why she doesn't work anymore, Marler doesn't know what to say.

""I can't explain debt to her,"" Marler, 29, said. ""And how I went to school and it was all for nothing.""

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

A federal judge ruled last year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' delays of an Obama-era regulation aimed at forgiving the student debt of defrauded students were illegal. Still, advocates say, the department continues to neglect the applications of those like Marler."
"The State Department denied more than 5,300 visas to Mexican nationals because they are poor",https://www.insider.com,['Nicole Einbinder'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.insider.com/state-department-denied-visas-mexican-nationals-poor-2019-8,"More than 5,300 Mexican nationals were denied visas between Oct. 1 and July 29 because they were poor and considered to be ""public charges"" dependent on the US government for support, according to data obtained by POLITICO.

The Trump administration released a proposed rule in October that would bar immigrants from obtaining a green card or seeking a visa renewal if they had received government benefits, or if they would likely need them in the future.

That regulation is expected to be finalized in the coming days.

Over the past year, more and more immigrants, particularly from Mexico, who hope to move the US are being denied due to public charge determinations.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The State Department denied 5,343 immigrant visa applications for Mexican nationals between Oct. 1 and July 29 because they were poor and, therefore, could be ""public charges"" dependent on the US government for support, according to data obtained by POLITICO.

That number compares to just seven applicants from Mexico who were denied in fiscal year 2016, President Barack Obama's last full year in the White House.

The whopping increase in public charge denials comes after the State Department last year gave US consular officers more discretion to reject visas if they believed that person could become a public charge and require public welfare benefits. In October, the Trump administration officially released a proposed public charge rule that would bar immigrants from obtaining a green card or seeking a visa renewal if they had received government benefits, like Medicaid, food stamps, or Section 8 housing vouchers, or if they would likely need them in the future.

As noted by POLITICO, that regulation is expected to be finalized in the coming days.

Over the past year, more and more immigrants, particularly from Mexico, who hope to come to the US are being denied due to these public charge determinations.

That was the case for 33-year-old Arturo Balbino, a Mexican national who had illegally entered the US 14 years ago and worked as a construction worker in Texas. Balbino applied for a spousal visa at the American consulate in Ciudad Juarez in March, believing his chances were strong because he had a wife and children who are US citizens, as well as a father-in-law who pledged to financially support him if necessary, he told Reuters in April.

Instead, his application was denied by the consular officer on the grounds that he could become a drain on US taxpayers by requiring government financial assistance, per documents reviewed by Reuters.

""At times I want to think that everything will be okay and I'll be able to be with my family again,"" Balbino said. ""It's very difficult to think that I won't be able to return to watch my children grow up.""

Several immigration lawyers told POLITICO that many of their Mexican clients, some of whom had lived in the US for years but are undocumented, have found themselves stranded in Mexico after being denied immigrant visas as a result of public charge.

In total, 12,179 visa applications from people across the world have been rejected due to public charge in the past year, per the preliminary data obtained by POLITICO, compared to 1,033 people in fiscal year 2016.

POLITICO noted that applicants from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic also saw major increases in denials due to concerns they would be a public charge and rely on government benefits.

As noted in a policy brief by the Migration Policy Institute, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that around 382,000 people within the US seeking a green card each year could be affected by public charge rules. The Institute found that another 559,000 people living abroad could be impacted when applying for visas abroad.

""It is imposing a tougher standard for working-class people,"" Charles Wheeler, a director with the pro-migrant Catholic Legal Immigration Network, told POLITICO."

California’s climate deal with automakers had been rejected by EPA,https://www.latimes.com,['Ryan Beene'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-06/california-climate-deal-automakers-trump-epa,"A compromise between four major automakers and California’s clean-air regulator on fuel efficiency was rejected by the Trump administration months earlier as not “a productive alternative.”

The deal — which Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW and Volkswagen announced July 25 alongside the California Air Resources Board — eases the pace of annual efficiency improvements required under current Obama-era rules but is tougher than the Trump administration’s proposal to cap mileage requirements at 2020 levels.

Key elements of the pact were contained in a November 2018 summary of California’s proposal that was prepared by Environmental Protection Agency staff for Bill Wehrum, who was assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation at the time, according to excerpts of the presentation viewed by Bloomberg.

Stanley Young, California Air Resources Board spokesman, confirmed Friday that the state had offered the plan to the EPA last November. The previously unreported detail sheds new light on the months-long battle between Washington and Sacramento over the mileage rules that automakers urged President Trump to reevaluate during his first weeks in office.

“Looking back, it seems that they were never interested in negotiations or discussions,” Young said. He added that the four automakers’ support of California’s compromise “highlights the fact that our proposal is both feasible and realistic.”

Relations between EPA and CARB officials have become tense, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown of talks. In a June 20 letter to Republican lawmakers, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said California’s counteroffer hadn’t yet been endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra when it was presented to EPA. He accused CARB Chairman Mary Nichols of being “unable or unwilling to be a good-faith negotiator.”

The Trump administration’s 2018 proposal said capping fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would lead new cars to be less expensive than they would be under the current rules. The agencies argued that more-affordable cars would enable people to replace their older vehicles with newer, safer ones more rapidly and avoid thousands of traffic fatalities — claims that experts and EPA career staffers have disputed.

Wheeler, in a February interview , said the state’s proposal suggested “just taking the Obama numbers and stretching that an additional year. And that doesn’t really get to the lives saved or the reducing the price of the automobiles to where we would like it to be.”

The White House abandoned discussions with California officials a few weeks later, saying, “Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative” after the federal proposal was released.

The four-company pact with California also highlights a growing chasm between the Trump administration and the auto industry, which after urging the administration to retool Obama-era mileage standards has since pushed back on the resulting plan that recommended capping requirements after 2020.

That plan, put forth last year by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also proposed stripping California of its authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions. The state and others have vowed to fight in court to retain that power, and automakers fear that prolonged litigation will roil business plans that depend on predictable fuel economy standards.

In June, a group of 17 major carmakers unsuccessfully asked Trump to resume talks with California, saying a pact for unified California-U.S. standards will “enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability.”

California’s deal with the four carmakers — and the one pitched to the EPA last fall — pushes the 2025 efficiency target back to 2026, lowering the pace of gains each year compared to the current rules starting in 2022. Automakers would get more help to reach those targets from additional compliance credits earned by selling electric vehicles, and wouldn’t have to account for carbon emissions by the power plants that generate electricity used by battery-powered cars.

“For over a year and a half, the administration expended a serious amount of resources to achieve a workable deal with California,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an email, adding, “not once did California submit a meaningful alternative.”

Dave Cooke, a senior clean-vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said California’s offer contained meaningful concessions.

“The fact that this was the deal that EPA called not serious is incredible to me,” he said. “This is a substantial reduction in stringency from the federal program.”"
Mass Shooting Legislation -- DOJ Studying Proposal That Would Make Mass Shootings a Capital Crime,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Jack Crowe', 'David French', 'Charles C. W.

(Jim Bourg/Reuters)

In response to the mass shootings that took place over the weekend, the Department of Justice has begun studying the impact of legislation that would make such attacks a capital crime.

Attorney General William Barr discussed the proposal as one of a number of potential responses to the two attacks that together claimed 31 lives over the weekend, CNN reported Monday.

Currently, federal law holds that the death penalty can be applied in cases where an attacker uses a weapon of mass destruction, such as an explosive, but has no similar provision for mass-casualty attacks perpetrated with a firearm. When mass-shootings occur, federal prosecutors resort to other laws, such as those criminalizing hate crimes, to secure the maximum possible sentence.

In order to draft legislation, Congress would have to define what qualifies as a “mass-shooting.” The FBI defines such shootings as those with four or more victims, while previous federal legislation defined them as those in which three or more people are shot.

At least 22 people were killed in El Paso, Texas on Saturday after a lone gunman opened fire in a Walmart. The perpetrator, who is currently in federal custody, drafted an anti-immigrant manifesto that detailed his motivations for the attack. He may face hate-crime charges in addition to capital-murder charges.

Another nine people were killed hours after the El Paso attack in the downtown district of Dayton, Ohio, after a young man opened fire on night-time revelers with a semi-automatic rifle. The shooter was killed on the scene after exchanging fire with police officers.

President Trump addressed the nation Monday morning, issuing a call for national unity and lamenting the “culture” of violence propagated by movies and video games. He did not mention gun-control legislation.

In a statement issued Monday, Democratic leaders urged Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call lawmakers back from their August recess to advance background-check legislation that was passed by the Democrat-controlled House earlier this year."
Don't Expect Every Question Answered by USDA's August Report,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/dont-expect-every-question-answered-usdas-august-report,"Grain markets settling down Tuesday following turbulence to start the week after what seems like an escalation in the trade war with China. Corn futures at the CME Group in Chicago have seen a steady march lower since last month.

In an interview on AgDay TV with Clinton Griffiths, Mark Gold of Top Third Ag Marketing says the issue is that the weather just hasn't been that bad since the rains slowed down in late June.

""We know that the pollination is way late,"" says Gold. ""We haven't had a whole lot of rain these last seven days, we're not going to get a whole lot in the next seven days but it's been enough.""

While there are spotty issues with dryness and heat, Gold says temperatures haven't been overly hot.

""There's not a whole lot of stress out there,"" says Gold. ""The big question is on the supply side and what are the acres?""

Gold thinks ultimately both yields and acres will trend lower in USDA's subsequent reports.

""I don't think the USDA is going to see a huge reduction in the acres from the last report, mainly because they're going to be including all those acres for silage,"" says Gold. ""One of the secretaries came out and said corn planted is corn planted and that means they're just going to lump it all together.""

Gold doesn't think the industry will get every answer they want in the August report. Regardless, he's expecting the market to react to the updated information.

""If the report is friendly, then obviously we can move a lot higher,"" says Gold. ""If they don't really make any changes in the numbers, the yield is still 165 or 166, we're going lower and maybe significantly lower.""

Gold says the biggest issue he sees on the horizon is softening demand given the trade issues facing the industry.

""We've got to offset that,"" says Gold. ""Even if we offset a 10% reduction in production, we're seeing a 10% reduction in demand.""​
