"Trump blasts Paul Ryan as 'weak, ineffective & stupid' in fresh attack on ex-Speaker",https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-paul-ryan-as-weak-and-ineffective-following-criticisms-in-upcoming-book,"President Trump unloaded on former House Speaker Paul Ryan for the second time in three days Saturday, mocking him as a ""Lame Duck"" and chiding his leadership style as ""ineffective"" and ""stupid.""

In a series of tweets, Trump praised House Minority Leader Keven McCarthy, R-Calif., calling him smarter and tougher than Ryan, who retired in January. He also characterized Ryan's fundraising numbers in his final year in office as ""abysmal"" and said people like him ""almost killed the Republican Party.""

TRUMP 'NOT ON BOARD' WITH JEFF SESSIONS RUNNING FOR ALABAMA SENATE SEAT: REPORT

""House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is a far superior leader than was Lame Duck Speaker Paul Ryan. Tougher, smarter and a far better fundraiser, Kevin is already closing in on 44 Million Dollars. Paul’s final year numbers were, according to Breitbart, 'abysmal,'"" Trump posted.

His comments come days after excerpts from an upcoming book the former House Speaker as saying that Trump “didn’t know anything about government” and that Ryan wanted to “scold him all the time.”

“Because I’m telling you, he didn’t know anything about government . . . I wanted to scold him all the time,"" Ryan reportedly said in the book, ""American Carnage"" by Politico reporter Tim Alberta. “Those of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions. All the time. We helped him make much better decisions, which were contrary to, kind of, what his knee-jerk reaction was. Now I think he’s making some of these knee-jerk reactions.”

Ryan recalled a difficult working relationship with Trump, during which he refused to endorse some of the president's more controversial policies such as a proposed travel ban affecting several Muslim-majority countries, as well as Trump's hardline immigration policies.

Alberta writes that Ryan couldn't stand the thought of another two years with Trump and saw retirement as an ""escape hatch,"" according to The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the book.

Late Thursday, Trump said that Ryan, who served in the House of Representatives for almost two decades, ""quit Congress because he didn’t know how to Win.""

""Paul Ryan, the failed V.P. candidate & former Speaker of the House, whose record of achievement was atrocious (except during my first two years as President), ultimately became a long running lame duck failure, leaving his Party in the lurch both as a fundraiser & leader..."" Trump tweeted.

Trump hasn't always been hostile toward the former GOP leader. When the Ryan and 2012 vice presidential candidate announced he would not seek re-election in 2018, Trump wished him well over Twitter.

""Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question,"" he posted at the time. ""We are with you Paul!"""
Mayors and protesters remain defiant ahead of ICE raids: “You’re going to have to come through us”,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/13/20693099/ice-raids-trump-chicago-new-york-san-francisco-denver-mayors-protesters,"Protesters around the country rallied against planned ICE raids this weekend as mayors renewed pledges to block ICE access to local law enforcement resources. The agency plans to sweep 10 cities on Sunday in an effort to detain 2,000 immigrants who have been issued final orders of removal.

The raids were originally scheduled for June at President Donald Trump’s request; however, the president postponed them shortly before they were set to begin to give Congress time to craft immigration reform legislation. Trump threatened to move forward with the raids if the legislative branch failed to make progress within two weeks.

That deadline has now passed, and ICE officials announced last week that the agency would raid cities including Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco beginning Sunday. Because of Tropical Storm Barry, the raids on New Orleans and Houston will reportedly postponed.

The Trump administration has maintained that the raids are necessary to enforce immigration law; after first announcing the operation, Trump tweeted the raids would target people who “have run from the law and run from the courts.”

Saturday, however, protesters in cities across the US argued the raids are a tool the Trump administration hopes to use to intimidate immigrant communities and target families with children who are themselves US citizens.

“It’s purely psychological,” Robert Suro, a public policy professor at USC, told the Los Angeles Times. “This is yet one more example of how the Trump administration is trying to use fear as an instrument of immigration control. It generates a lot of fear and anxiety but not a lot of control. This has nothing to do with actual enforcement.”

Suro said there are currently 1 million undocumented migrants with deportation orders, which means the 2,000 targeted by ICE amount to just 0.2 percent of those who face deportation.

Trump initially hoped to target more undocumented immigrants; in his initial announcement, he promised “ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

Logistical and operational constraints as well as the recommendations of senior officials like Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan (who reportedly told the president a more limited operation targeting 150 families would be wiser) led to a reduced scope. Also complicating matters was the refusal of many local governments to cooperate with ICE agents. Ahead of Sunday’s raids, many mayors have once again instructed their police departments not to aid ICE agents operating in their cities.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed said, “If you want to come after them, you’re going to have to come through us.”

In Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock said not only had he directed his officers to refrain from assisting ICE, but that he has tasked social service employees with watching over any children left without parents because of the raid.

“We’re not going to put children in cages or leave them in inhumane conditions,” Hancock said. “Our job is to help those families as best as we can.”

Mayor Keisha Bottoms of Atlanta said, “Our officers don’t enforce immigration borders. We’ve closed our city detention centers to ICE because we don’t want to be complicit in family separation,” and other mayors, including Chicago’s Lori Lightfoot and New York’s Bill de Blasio have made similar statements.

Citizens of cities affected by the raids also publicly protested the raids. In Denver, around 2,000 protesters gathered for a rally outside a nearby ICE facility on Friday.

“We feel every person has the right to dignity,” protester Jason Hayman told the Denver Post. “We also feel that immigrants are not being given the dignity that they deserve, like everyone else.”

Protesters in Chicago were joined by Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and US Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia, who told the crowd, “It’s about damn time we tell this racist president loud and clear: Stop criminalizing desperation.”

Similar protests were also seen in other affected cities, like Los Angeles and New York; citizens of cities not directly targeted by ICE also protested. In Phoenix, protesters blocked streets and chanted “Free those kids!” while marchers in Philadelphia shouted “Shut down ICE!” as they took to the streets Friday.

ICE facilities in places such as Greenfield, Massachusetts also saw protesters gather outside.

Despite these protests and local governments’ refusal to coordinate with ICE, the raids are expected to proceed as planned. Although Trump cancelled the original operation hours before it was set to begin, acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli suggested on Wednesday that would be unlikely to happen again — he told reporters the raids were “absolutely going to happen.”"
Democrats and Republicans agree — Donald Trump will be re-elected,https://nypost.com,"['Michael Goodwin', 'July']",07-13-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/13/democrats-and-republicans-agree-donald-trump-will-be-re-elected/,"It’s a mixed marriage of a certain kind. He was a Trump supporter all along and she ­detested the man.

But these days, they agree on one big thing: The president will be ­re-elected. Easily.

“Easily?” I asked, making sure I heard them correctly. Yes, they insisted, with her nodding as he said Democrats had gone bonkers and voters would respond by giving Trump four more years.

The recent Manhattan conversation would be insignificant except that it dovetails with national trends, namely a growing belief that Dems are not coming back to this world anytime soon. The election is still a long way off, but there is no sign that the radicalism surging through the party can be put back in the bottle before the election. What we see now is likely what voters will see in 2020.

One of many defining moments among the presidential contenders and pretenders came with their unanimous support for giving illegal immigrants free health care. They raised their hands to signal yes, as if the question was a ­no-brainer.

Implicit in their so-called compassion is an invitation for millions and millions more to cross the border and get free care. Free, of course, except to American taxpayers.

Those first debates produced lots of news, and a meaningful insight. While coverage understandably focused on which candidates were rising and which were falling, a potentially more important fact was that the extreme positions taken by all the candidates made Trump the real winner.

Emerson College polling found that, after the debates, the president improved in head-to-head matchups against the top tier, gaining about 5 points on each. As a result, instead of trailing five Dems, he now leads three of them and narrowed the gap with the other two, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

If Trump Derangement Syndrome were limited to the campaign trail, there might be hope. But an outbreak of epidemic proportions is claiming victims up and down the food chain.

Cue the music from “The Twilight Zone” and consider the case of Rep. Jerry Nadler, who appears to be possessed by impeachment fever. Nadler doesn’t have any ­evidence and doesn’t need any ­because Trump is his white whale. We know how that story ends.

Then there’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her “squad,” all of whom look more and more like rebels without a cause except their own fame. Scorned by their party’s leaders, they give the impression they’d rather burn it down than turn it down.

Their colleague from Missouri, Rep. William Clay, got it exactly right when he called them “juvenile,” but they don’t embarrass easily. What looked like a family squabble is now turning the Hatfields vs. the ­McCoys.

As Dems continue to devour each other , there are times when it would be wise for the president to follow the rule that you should never get in the way when your opponent is committing suicide. But this is not that time, and Trump made a smart move by announcing that he would seek to get the facts about citizens and noncitizens from existing government data ­instead of the census.

As he and Attorney General William Barr noted, the Supreme Court showed how to cure the mistakes made when the administration tried to put a citizenship question on the census questionnaire, but there is no time to go through another tortuous round of litigation.

While the new executive order surely will be challenged, Trump’s efforts draw a favorable contrast with the other side. The shocker is not that he’s trying to learn the facts about who is in the country, but that nobody on the left wants to know.

Because Trump is for it, they must oppose it at any cost. Chalk that up as more evidence that Dems hate the president more than they care about commonsense approaches to the nation’s problems.

Broadly speaking, Trump’s focus on borders is the linchpin of his presidency and the essence of putting Americans first. His commitment, which has ebbed at times, was always popular with his core supporters, but the appeal is spreading because of the unrelenting surge of illegal crossers and the Dems’ rigid opposition to any ­measure that could stop it.

More than 100,000 people were apprehended in June and officials say many more crossed undetected. No rational American can say the situation is acceptable, yet even Friday, Ocasio-Cortez was still calling it a “manufactured” ­crisis.

Similarly, the widespread hysteria over the planned roundup of those with outstanding deportation orders is bizarre. If deportation orders are meaningless, why bother with the expense and trouble of having a border at all?

Incredible as it seems, an America without borders appears to be where the left is going, with AOC the latest to say that Homeland Security should be eliminated. If she knows, she doesn’t care that the creation of the Cabinet-level department was in reaction to the horrors of 9/11. The measure passed the House with 68 percent of the vote and got 90 votes in the Senate, with Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton among those voting aye.

But if AOC gets her way, it’s bye-bye FEMA, airport security, the Coast Guard, border control, the Secret Service and nearly a score of other agencies.

That won’t happen, of course, because the idea is utterly insane and because Nancy Pelosi is too smart of a speaker to let it ever come close to a vote. But even just the talk of eliminating the security designed after the worst attack in America’s history is the stuff from which landslides are made — for the other party.

MTA Chairman … let’s make a deal

Give MTA Chairman Pat Foye credit: He finally linked the odious congestion taxes with the need for the spendthrift agency to get its house in order.

Problem is, he has the order backwards.

Foye called overtime and other abuses “appalling” and said the agency must prove itself “responsible stewards” of public funds.

But the MTA already gets the first round of congestion taxes — before making a single spending reform. That means motorists could be funding the “appalling” waste indefinitely.

Let’s reverse the process: First the MTA fixes itself, then gets a reward.

Do we have a deal?

Bad games Dems play

Reader Carmine LoMonaco, retired from the NYPD, agrees that city and state Dems need another Ed Koch. He writes: “Koch certainly knew how to play the game of politics. New York could have gotten so much from our President but instead these foolish partisans wasted valuable time and money chasing their own tails and did nothing productive.

“The anger should be directed at Chuck Schumer, Jerry Nadler and Andrew Cuomo for not playing the game the right way for New York.”

Bowwow, Brodie!

The understatement of the year comes from Brodie Van Wagenen, general manager of the hapless Mets.

“We view ourselves as the underdogs.”"
E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"
"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

""What they were probably trying to get Trump to do was say something publicly, tweet something ... probably their best dream was for him to fire Mueller ... and then you'd have public sympathy and public support"" for action against Trump.

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."
Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."
EPA expands use of pesticide that can be toxic to bees,https://fox6now.com,['Cnn Wire Service'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://fox6now.com/2019/07/12/epa-expands-use-of-pesticide-that-can-be-toxic-to-bees/,"× EPA expands use of pesticide that can be toxic to bees

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday that it will approve the expanded use of a pesticide that’s known to harm bees and other pollinators.

The insecticide, called sulfoxaflor, will be allowed for use on some crops for the first time and in areas that were prohibited under the Obama administration. An EPA report this week notes that some forms of the pesticide can be “very highly toxic” to bees.

EPA official Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said Friday on a briefing call that the pesticide is the only product that can protect crops to prevent economic losses with a limited environmental impact and “strong protection for pollinators.”

She said the EPA had decided to allow the expanded use of the pesticide based on studies that say it disappears from the environment faster than viable alternatives. Dapolito Dunn acknowledged these studies were largely produced by industry groups, but said that is the norm as those groups have the resources to produce the studies.

The EPA will require a statement on product labels that says: “This product is highly toxic to bees and other pollinating insects exposed to direct treatment or to residues in/on blooming crops or weeds. Protect pollinating insects by following label directions intended to minimize drift and reduce pesticide risk to these organisms.”

But critics are hammering what they see as the Trump administration’s disregard for the threatened bee population.

“The Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this bee-killing pesticide … without any public process is a terrible blow to imperiled pollinators,” Lori Ann Burd, a Center for Biological Diversity director and senior attorney, told CNN on Friday.

Last week, the Trump administration announced that it will suspend data collection for its annual Honey Bee Colonies report. The move, which robs researchers and the honeybee industry of a critical tool for understanding honeybee population declines, comes as the Department of Agriculture is also curtailing other research programs.

In 2014, the Obama administration launched a program to address honeybee population losses, directing federal agencies to work toward preserving bee pollinator populations. The Trump administration has gone the other way, reversing an Obama-era rule meant to protect bees from a chemical family that can cause colonies to collapse."

Trump DOJ scores rare win on sanctuary city crackdown in appeals court,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doj-scores-rare-win-on-sanctuary-city-crackdown-in-appeals-court,"President Trump notched a win on Friday in a federal appeals court, which upheld a Department of Justice method for cracking down on sanctuary cities.

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

Amid the many news releases issued each week by the Environmental Protection Agency, a few stand out. Such as these:

• “Politico Misleads On Trump EPA’s Progress Cleaning Up Superfund Sites.”

• “The Hill [newspaper] Gets It Wrong On New EPA FOIA Regulation.”

• “National Correspondent Misleads on Wheeler’s Remarks.”

While the Trump administration is not known for velvety smooth relations with the news media, federal agencies are far more likely to ignore reporters than to officially scold them. Not the EPA. Reporters whom the agency deems to have misreported can expect to hear about it, and not just through a polite phone call or an email requesting a correction.

Instead, the EPA goes public.

“A reader of Politico would have been rightfully confused about the results” of an inspector general’s report about a Superfund task force, the EPA declared in a June 24 release. “It is only fair to ask why they chose to ignore the key findings of this report.”

A day later, the EPA’s communications wing weighed in on the Hill’s story about a new regulation. “The Hill used a false premise and ran a grossly inaccurate story,” it said. It went on to list “THE HILL’s FALSE QUOTES,” “MORE OF THE HILL’S FALSE QUOTES” and “MORE FALSE REPORTING FROM THE HILL.”

A spokeswoman for the Hill, Lisa Dallos, said the publication stands by its story. Politico’s spokesman, Brad Dayspring, characterized the Superfund story as “fair and fact based.”

The EPA’s unusual approach is in some ways a return to its recent past. Under former administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned a year ago amid various scandals, the agency attacked reporters on a semiregular basis. The pushback sometimes took on a nasty tone. Pruitt’s spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, who has also left the agency, once responded to a reporter who was seeking comment for a story by telling her, “You have a great day, you’re a piece of trash.”

Things simmered down with Pruitt’s departure, but have lately begun to grow toxic again.

The EPA’s top media manager says the approach nowadays is kinder and gentler but still firm. “I’m trying not to get into name calling or picking fights,” said Corry Schiermeyer, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency. “I honestly just want to ensure that when anyone reports about our policies and issues that the reporting is correct and accurate.”

The news releases, she said, are a way to establish an official record before a disputed story goes viral on social media: “If we sat back and didn’t do anything, it can spin out of control.”

Reporters on the beat, however, are somewhat baffled by the agency’s aggressiveness, especially because Pruitt’s replacement, former energy-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, is more low-key than his predecessor.

Asked who decides when to publicly call out a news organization, Schiermeyer hedged. “That’s a good question,” she said after a pause. “I wouldn’t say it’s the policy of Corry Schiermeyer’s office. I would say it’s often done on a case-by-case basis, by my office or others within the agency who feel that something was an egregious mischaracterization.”

That includes Wheeler, who Schiermeyer said objected to a tweet by Yahoo News correspondent Alexander Nazaryan about a speech Wheeler gave in June. Wheeler’s apparent peeve led to a news release asserting that Nazaryan “deliberately spread false information on twitter by misreporting Administrator Wheeler’s comments.” In response, Nazaryan tweeted Yahoo News “stands by the accuracy of our reporting.” Nazaryan declined to comment for this story.

News sources typically seek redress through discussion and negotiation with reporters and their editors. But the EPA’s critiques of Nazaryan and Politico had one striking difference: The agency posted its news releases without seeking a corrections or retractions the organizations, effectively blindsiding both. Schiermeyer acknowledged officials failed to do so, but said neither Politico nor Yahoo contacted the agency before publication.

Most recently, the agency trained its fire on the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ), in effect challenging en masse reporters who cover the EPA. Agency officials objected to a letter written by the group to Wheeler about the agency’s new Freedom of Information Act regulations. In a news release, the agency criticized the letter, saying it included “numerous inaccuracies that were regurgitated from false articles.”

“They took it as an opportunity to discredit or suggest environmental journalists were misleading the public,” said Bobby Magill, SEJ’s president. “It’s part of a larger pattern of trying to smear the press.”

Magill, a reporter for Bloomberg Environment, said he objected to “the tone” of the EPA’s response. “It’s one thing to set the record straight,” he said. “It’s a whole other thing to suggest you’re intentionally misleading people.”

But by rebutting in such a public way, the EPA risks calling more attention to the stories it’s disputing, a potential example of the Streisand effect, in which an effort to rebut or suppress information has the unintended consequence of drawing more interest to it (the phenomenon was named for legendary singer and actor Barbra Streisand, whose attempts to keep an aerial photograph of her Malibu home out of public view led to a spike of interest in it). The disputed Politico story, for example, was available only through Politico’s subscription service, so few would have known about it before the EPA complained.

Schiermeyer, however, thinks the approach can prevent worse outcomes. The public naming and shaming “can slow things down and sometimes stop misinformation from continuing to be repurposed,” she said. “You might not be able to stop the first reporter, but at least the second and third and fourth reporter” will see information the agency considers accurate."
Trump officially issues executive order to tally citizens through the Commerce Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-officially-issues-executive-order-to-tally-citizens-through-the-commerce-department,"President Trump officially issued his executive order Thursday, which demands all other departments and agencies provide the Commerce Department with any information related to citizenship.

Trump issued the order after courts ruled against having the citizenship question on the 2020 census. The order was also issued to avoid delaying the census any longer.

""To achieve that goal, I have determined that it is imperative that all executive departments and agencies provide the Department the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective,"" the executive order states.

All agencies are being ordered to provide the citizenship data to an interagency working group that will be created to process the information.

State information on citizens will also be sent to the Commerce Department.

In the order, Trump outlines which information will be sent by which federal agency:



Department of Homeland Security: National-level file of Lawful Permanent Residents, naturalizations, F1 and M1 nonimmigrant visas, national-level file of customs and border arrival/departure transaction data

Department of State: refugee and asylum visas, national-level passport application data

Social Security Administration: Master beneficiary records

Department of Health and Human Services: CMS Medicaid and CHIP Information System

Trump has instructed the Commerce Department begin planning the administrative processes necessary to add the citizenship question to the census in 2030."

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution

Level 3 - Reconsider travel

Level 4 - Do not travel

About half of Asia is classed as low risk, but there are six countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Yemen that are designated Level 4, mostly due to military conflicts, crime, and terrorism threats.

Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security. Some conservatives didn’t want it to begin with.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Marisa Iati'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/11/ocasio-cortez-wants-axe-homeland-security-some-conservatives-didnt-want-it-begin-with/,"

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

[‘I hate this mission,’ says operator of new emergency shelter for migrant children]

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

Nomination of another top Pentagon pick potentially in trouble after questions about conduct,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON -- Another of President Donald Trump's nominations for a top Pentagon post is potentially in peril amid accusations of inappropriate conduct.

The Air Force Office of Special Investigations cleared Air Force Gen. John Hyten of wrongdoing after a senior officer alleged he subjected her to unwanted sexual advances. But a key lawmaker helping to vet his nomination to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is raising concerns about the integrity of the probe.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., a member of the Armed Services Committee and the top Democrat on its personnel subcommittee, wrote to Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Friday asking him to personally review the case and saying she is ""not prepared to move forward with consideration of General Hyten’s candidacy for the second highest military office in our nation without, at minimum, such a thorough review.""

""As Pentagon leadership continues to publicly underscore that it is doing all it can to counter the sexual assault problem in the military, I ask that your office sets the best example,"" Gillibrand said. ""Your office and other DoD senior leaders need to show that sexual assault allegations against the most senior officials will be treated the same as when junior enlisted members are accused of similar felony-level crimes.”

Days after Hyten's nomination was announced in April, the officer reported the general had kissed and hugged her and rubbed up against her against her will, the Associated Press reported Wednesday. The investigation of the allegations found ""insufficient evidence to support any finding of misconduct,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Col. DeDe Halfhill said.

""With more than 38 years of service to our Nation, Gen Hyten has proven himself to be a principled and dedicated patriot,” she said.

But Gillibrand said she has concerns the investigation happened ""exceedingly quickly for such criminal inquiries"" and was conducted by a fellow Air Force general with less seniority.

""The reasonable decision would have been to appoint an official more senior than the accused, possibly one in a different service, to avoid conflicts of interest or even a perception of such by the rank and file or the public,"" she said.

Hyten is the third top Defense official to face questions about past conduct in less than a month. In June, Patrick Shanahan resigned as acting Defense secretary after USA TODAY and others revealed details about his turbulent divorce and family life.

Last week, Navy Adm. Bill Moran announced he was retiring after a USA TODAY request for his correspondence with a former aide triggered a call for an inspector general's probe. Moran had already been confirmed by the Senate and was slated to begin work August 1 as the Navy's top officer and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

More: Navy's choice to head Naval Operations to step down amid call for inspector general's investigation

Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said Moran's continued contact with the aide, who had been disciplined for making inappropriate sexual advances, ""caused me to call his judgment into question,"" and he accepted Moran's request to retire. The content of the correspondence is unknown because USA TODAY's Freedom of Information Act request remains outstanding. Official Navy business must be conducted on government accounts.

The officer who accused Hyten of unwanted sexual advances began working for him in 2016, according to the AP, which did not identify her by name. She said there were multiple incidents of inappropriate contact the following year, including at a California hotel where he came to her room in workout clothes and hugged her and rubbed against her. The officer said that when she told him to leave, he asked her if she planned to report him. She said she told him she wouldn't.

The officer said she didn't tell anyone at the time or report him for fear of retaliation. She said she also thought he was going to retire. But when his nomination was announced, the officer reported the incidents to the Pentagon's inspector general.

The inspector general referred the allegations to the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations, which ""conducted an independent investigation,"" Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said.

""Then, after a thorough review of the evidence collected by OSI, which included numerous witness interviews and relevant documents, and after meeting with the alleged victim, the designated General Court-Martial Convening Authority determined there was insufficient evidence to support any finding of misconduct,” Stefanek said.

Gillibrand asked the acting Defense secretary to provide the investigation file to the accusing officer and to meet with her personally to hear her side.

It’s unclear when, or if, Hyten’s confirmation hearing will be scheduled. The current vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Paul Selva, is scheduled to retire at the end of the month.

In a letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mnuchin wrote that the US might default on its obligations as soon as early September, before Congress returns from its summer recess

""Based on updated projections, there is a scenario in which we run of out cash in early September, before Congress reconvenes,"" Mnuchin wrote in a letter.

The federal government has not been able to borrow money since March, when congressionally-mandated borrowing limits went back into force. The US Treasury, which is facing a growing deficit thanks in part to President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, had said it had enough cash to last until the fall.

Pelosi and Mnuchin have spoken three times this week in an effort to jumpstart stalled budget and debt ceiling negotiations, and multiple sources say the new default projections have provided an accelerant for those efforts.

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

The VA said it does not have any formal projections as to how the changes brought on by the bill will its home loan guaranty program."

Los Angeles chose ""building trust and respect"" as its focus area and did not mention illegal immigration in its application because of its policy as a sanctuary city.

The panel of judges ruled that ""because DOJ's scoring factors encouraged, but did not coerce, an applicant to cooperate on immigration matters, the panel also rejected Los Angeles's claims that DOJ's use of the factors infringed on state autonomy in a manner that raised Tenth Amendment concerns.""

"EPA restores broad use of pesticide opposed by beekeepers - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.10tv.com/article/epa-restores-broad-use-pesticide-opposed-beekeepers-2019-jul,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency will allow farmers to resume broad use of a pesticide over objections from beekeepers, citing private chemical industry studies that the agency says show the product does only lower-level harm to bees and wildlife.

Friday's EPA announcement — coming after the agriculture industry accused the agency of unduly favoring honeybees — makes sulfoxaflor the latest bug- and weed-killer allowed by the Trump administration despite lawsuits alleging environmental or human harm. The pesticide is made by Corteva Agriscience, a spinoff created last month out of the DowDuPont merger and restructuring.

Honeybees pollinate billions of dollars of food crops annually in the United States, but agriculture and other land uses that cut into their supply of pollen, as well as pesticides, parasites and other threats, have them on a sharp decline. The University of Maryland said U.S. beekeepers lost 38 percent of their bee colonies last winter alone, the highest one-winter loss in the 13-year history of their survey.

Advertisement - Story continues below

Emails and other records obtained from the EPA through Freedom of Information Act litigation by the Sierra Club, and provided to The Associated Press, show sorghum growers in particular had pressed senior officials at the agency for a return to broad use of sulfoxaflor.

Sorghum growers regard honeybees as just another ""non-native livestock"" in the United States, lobbyist Joe Bischoff said in one 2017 email to agency officials, and by cutting threats to the bees, ""EPA has chosen that form of agriculture over all others.""

A federal appeals court had ordered the EPA to withdraw approval for sulfoxaflor in 2015, ruling in a lawsuit brought by U.S. beekeeping groups that not enough was known about what it did to bees.

EPA Assistant Administrator Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said Friday that new industry studies that have not been made public show a low level of harm to bees and other creatures beyond the targeted crop pests.

Dunn said EPA's newly reset rules for use of sulfoxaflor, such as generally prohibiting spraying of fruit and nut-bearing plants in bloom, when pollinators would be attracted to the flowers, would limit harm to bees. She called it ""an important and highly effective tool for growers.""

Michele Colopy, program director of the Pollinator Stewardship Council, one of the beekeeping groups that had successfully sued to block sulfoxaflor, said the EPA limits weren't enough to protect bees and other beneficial bugs whose numbers are declining.

""We understand farmers want to have every tool in their toolbox,"" when it comes to curbing insects that damage crops. ""But the ... pesticides are just decimating beneficial insects,"" Colopy said.

An environmental group charged the EPA with sidestepping the usual public review in reapproving broader use of the pesticide.

""The Trump EPA's reckless approval... without any public process is a terrible blow to imperiled pollinators,"" said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced without fanfare on July 1 that it would stop collecting quarterly data on honeybee colonies, citing budget restrictions. Beekeepers and others used the data to track losses and growth in U.S. honeybee colonies.

Other Trump administration decisions have upheld market use of the weed-killing glyphosate, which is now the target of thousands of consumer lawsuits over alleged harm to people exposed to it, and shelved an Obama-era decision to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos as a threat to human health."

""It's not just an issue of regulation, it's an issue of health and safety,"" said Nevada Division of Environmental Protection Administrator Greg Lovato.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Energy for comment.

According to the Nevada National Security Site website, low-level waste generally includes materials such as rags, papers, filters, equipment, discarded protective clothing and construction debris.

Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department,https://www.npr.org,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/12/741237553/looking-back-at-secretary-alex-acostas-tenure-at-the-labor-department,"Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department

Secretary Alex Acosta stepped down Friday from the Department of Labor. NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Bloomberg Law senior reporter Ben Penn about Acosta's tenure at the department.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta resigned today. His resignation comes just days after his role in the more-than-decade-old plea deal of multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was spelled out. Epstein was accused of sex crimes but received a light sentence after pleading guilty to lesser charges.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALEX ACOSTA: I do not think it is right and fair for this administration's Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today. And so I called the president this morning; I told him that I thought the right thing was to step aside.

CORNISH: That's Acosta at the White House, standing next to President Trump, who said this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I just want to let you know - this was him, not me. Because I'm with him.

CORNISH: So what was Acosta like as secretary of labor? To learn more about Acosta's tenure, we have Ben Penn. He's senior reporter, covering labor and employment for Bloomberg Law. And welcome to the studio.

BEN PENN: Thank you for having me.

CORNISH: So to begin, this is a labor secretary who didn't have a business background, didn't have a labor background. So what made him unique to this position?

PENN: He came from a legal background. He was the dean of Florida International University Law School for about the previous eight years before he became labor secretary. He had been a U.S. attorney based out of South Florida - obviously, because of the Epstein case. So...

CORNISH: It seemed like he would have been on a judicial track.

PENN: Yes. So there was wide speculation, in part due to the fact that he is good friends with the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, that his ultimate dream was to become a federal judge, and that is no longer a reality for him now that he is embroiled in the Epstein scandal. But it was definitely something that played a role in how he ruled the Department of Labor in a more legally-minded, deliberate, cautious manner.

CORNISH: How did his role change over time?

PENN: So in his first year and a half as labor secretary, he faced criticism from the business community and some of the more conservative forces in the White House for stalling deregulatory actions that businesses would have favored, such as a rule that would have been a more moderate approach than the Obama administration to determining who is eligible for overtime. And what we saw then, starting in 2019, once Mick Mulvaney became acting chief of staff, was Acosta really had some of his power taken away from him.

I reported earlier this year that Mulvaney instituted a formalized system where, whenever White House assistants and DOL agency heads below Acosta reached an impasse on a deregulatory matter, it would get automatically elevated up to Mulvaney for a final decision. And frequently, Acosta was getting overruled to the point that the Labor Department stopped exercising this system altogether because they knew that Mulvaney was going to have final say.

CORNISH: To that end, what kind of criticism did he get from, say, labor activists? How was he viewed?

PENN: Interestingly, labor activists did not really come out full throttle against Alex Acosta, and really, that's because they feel that Acosta gave them a fair shot. He was not a type of Cabinet member who sought to destroy the agency from the inside out, like other Trump Cabinet members have been criticized for. The perception was, among labor activists, that this was about as good of a labor secretary that they could ask for.

CORNISH: Who might take his place? What would the White House be looking for?

PENN: So right now, Acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella - or at least he'll become acting labor secretary effective one week from today. Pizzella is well-liked by some members of the White House, I'm told, so it wouldn't surprise me at all if he already has an inside track on the nomination, if there were to be one.

CORNISH: That's Ben Penn, senior reporter with Bloomberg Law. Thanks for your reporting.

PENN: Thank you very much for having me.

Police Kill Man Allegedly Attacking a DHS Migrant Detention Facility in Washington State,https://time.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://time.com/5625987/police-kill-immigration-prison-tacoma/,"TACOMA, Wash. — A man armed with a rifle and throwing incendiary devices at an immigration jail in Washington state early Saturday morning died after four police officers arrived and opened fire, authorities said.

The Tacoma Police Department said the officers responded at about 4 a.m. to the privately run Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security detention facility that holds migrants pending deportation proceedings. The detention center has also held immigration-seeking parents separated from their children under President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, an effort meant to deter illegal immigration.

The shooting took place about six hours after a peaceful rally in front of the detention center, police spokesman Loretta Cool said. She said another rally was planned for later Saturday, but it would have to be held in a different area because of the investigation into the police shooting.

Police said the man caused a vehicle to catch fire and that he attempted to ignite a large propane tank and set buildings on fire. Police said that besides the rifle, he had a satchel and flares.

Police said officers called out to the man, and shots were fired.

Cool said all four officers fired their weapons, but she didn’t have specific details of what took place. She said the officers weren’t wearing body cameras, but the area is covered by surveillance cameras from the detention center. She said she didn’t know if the man fired at the officers.

After the gunfire, officers took cover, contained the area and set up medical aid a short distance away, police said.

Officers then located the man and determined he had been shot and was dead at the scene. His name hasn’t been released.

Authorities say investigators are processing the scene and police are continuing to investigate. No law enforcement officers were injured. The four Tacoma police officers who fired their weapons have been placed on paid administrative leave as is standard in officer-involved shootings.

A motive for the man’s actions hasn’t been determined, Cool said.

GEO Group, which runs the 1,575-bed Northwest Detention Center, in an email to The Associated Press said baseless accusations about how detainees are treated at its facilities “have led to misplaced aggression and a dangerous environment for our employees, whose safety is our top priority. Violence of any kind against our employees and property will not be tolerated. We are thankful for the quick and brave action by the Tacoma Police Department, which prevented innocent lives from being endangered.”

GEO Group said the detention center in Tacoma has modern amenities with air conditioning, recreational activities, a bed for every individual and medical care available at all hours.

Last year, a federal judge ruled that Washington state could pursue its lawsuit seeking to force GEO Group to pay minimum wage for work done by detainees at the detention center.

In November, a Russian asylum-seeker who conducted a hunger strike to protest the conditions at the detention center died by suicide, the Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled.

Mergensana Amar, 40, was taken off life support after attempting to kill himself while in voluntary protective custody at the detention center on Nov. 15, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.

"Justice Dept. Tells Mueller Deputies Not to Testify, Scrambling an Agreement",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Katie Benner']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/mueller-testimony-justice-department.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is seeking to discourage Robert S. Mueller III’s deputies from testifying before Congress, potentially jeopardizing an agreement for two of the former prosecutors to answer lawmakers’ questions in private next week, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

The department told the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees last week that it was opposed to the testimony and had communicated its view to the two former members of Mr. Mueller’s team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the discussions. A Justice Department official confirmed that account and said that the department had instructed both men not to appear.

It is unclear what effect the Justice Department’s intervention will have on the men’s eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel.

Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department’s view — depending on how strongly it is expressed — could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying."
EPA scientist confronts administrator over climate crisis at award ceremony,https://www.cnn.com,['Cat Gloria'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/epa-wheeler-employee-protest-climate-crisis/index.html,"Washington (CNN) An Environmental Protection Agency scientist confronted EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler about agency working conditions and how it is approaching the climate crisis Wednesday morning at an award ceremony in Washington.

""Administrator Wheeler, I'd like to ask you to please support a fair contract for EPA workers,"" Loreen Targos, an EPA scientist in the Great Lakes area, is seen saying in a video provided by the union. ""Please reward my award-winning labor by negotiating a fair contract.""

Targos was receiving a Silver Medal award on stage at EPA headquarters when she unveiled a banner reading ""Care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health & climate change, Do you?"" She also criticized the agency's recent unilateral change to the master bargaining agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, one of several unions representing EPA employees.

Targos said a fair contract is needed to continue research into ""fighting climate change.""

This comes on the back of several instances where government workers have spoken out against the administration's policies, including when employees of the Department of Agriculture turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a meeting last month in protest of the announced office relocation to Kansas City.

INVESTIGATION: Veterans owed millions in refunds on VA home loans,https://www.13newsnow.com,"['Author', 'Published', 'Pm Edt July', 'Updated']",07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/investigation-veterans-owed-millions-in-refunds-on-va-home-loans/291-e2434652-86a8-4d91-85df-071b86dbc7a5,"NORFOLK, Va. — A new report from the VA’s Inspector General accuses senior officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs of failing to protect the financial interests of disabled veterans who used the agency’s popular home loan guarantee program.

As a result, the Department of Veterans Affairs owes approximately 53,200 veterans an estimated $189 million in home loan refunds, according to the report.

The findings by the VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) mirror the disclosures in TEGNA’s Funding Fee Fiasco investigation.

TEGNA’s investigation revealed that senior VA managers in Washington were warned about funding fee overcharges five years ago by officials in the St. Paul, Minnesota Regional Loan Center, but failed to take corrective action.

The OIG report called what took place “troubling.”

OIG’s report states, “Because inappropriate funding fee charges were not refunded, many exempt veterans may have suffered significant financial losses.”

What’s more, since officials didn’t act when they were alerted about the problem in 2014, the overcharges have continued.

The refund amounts veterans are owed are often substantial. The average funding fee charge was $4,483, with the largest topping out at $19,470.

Roger’s VA Home Loan

Roger Roath purchased his Lakeville, Minnesota home with the help of the VA’s widely praised Home Loan Guarantee Program. The history of why he is owed money is buried in his stack of home loan records.

The nation’s debt to Roger began in the 1960s when he enlisted in the Navy.

“I served in Vietnam off the Gulf of Tonkin from 1968 to 1969... aircraft carrier,” he said proudly.

Roger said he’s had ringing in his ears ever since. So in 2011, he applied for a disability rating with the VA. After an initial denial, he appealed. His claim was eventually approved, but it took time.

“Approximately three years later,” he recalled.

Roger Roath is one of tens of thousands of veterans nationwide a KARE 11 investigation has discovered are owed a home loan refund

KARE

While his disability case was still pending, Roger refinanced his loan as interest rates continued to go down.

“Twice: 2011 and 2013,” he said. He used the VA’s Home Loan Program both times.

Disability waivers

Veterans who use the VA program are generally required to pay what’s called a ""Funding Fee"" -- up to 3.3 percent of the loan amount. In Roger’s case, that added up to thousands of dollars.

For disabled veterans, however, that funding fee is waived.

Since Roger’s disability claim was still pending when he refinanced his VA loan, he had to pay the fee.

But the VA’s own rules say that if a disability claim is approved after a loan is finalized – and the disability rating is made retroactive like Roger’s was – the veteran is due a refund of the funding fees.

Unfortunately, Roger says he didn’t know about that until he saw an investigative report on KARE 11, TEGNA’s Minneapolis station, detailing a problem in the VA’s Home Loan program.

And he is not alone.

Whistleblowers: veterans weren’t informed

In May, a whistleblower provided internal VA records that revealed a bombshell. Disabled veterans across the county who were owed home loan refunds weren’t always getting them, according to an analysis of funding fees done back in 2014 by employees at the VA’s St. Paul Regional Loan Center.

Between 2006 and 2014, “VA inappropriately collected approximately $150,901,534 on 47,588 loans,” their report concluded at the time.

Multiple VA insiders, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs, said that high ranking officials at Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, D.C., were informed of the issue five years ago.

Despite the warning, they said officials failed to ensure that veterans got the refunds they deserved.

Records show that Mike Frueh, then Director of the VA Loan Guaranty Program, and Deputy Director Jeffrey London were made aware in 2014 that veterans were being inappropriately charged and not given refunds.

Frueh was later promoted to Chief of Staff for Veterans Benefits and Jeffrey London took over from his old boss and is now Executive Director of the Loan Guaranty Service.

The newly released OIG investigation confirms the managers had been warned about the outstanding debts owed to veterans and did nothing to rectify the overcharges.

The OIG Investigation

“Disturbingly, as of January 2019, Loan Guaranty Service management had not taken action to issue refunds to these exempt veterans,” the OIG report states.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior VBA management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” VA Assistant Inspector General for Audits and Evaluations Larry Reinkeymer wrote in the report.

Read the OIG investigation:

Meanwhile, the number of veterans affected and the amount they are owed grew, from an estimated $150 million in 2014 to $189 million by the end of 2017, the OIG investigation found.

The OIG report warned the totals could soar even higher.

“The review team estimated that VA could owe an additional 34,400 exempt veterans funding fee refunds of $164 million over the next five years if adequate controls are not implemented to minimize or detect these inappropriate charges,” the report states.

On April 26, 2019, TEGNA’s investigative team began requesting interviews with VA officials about the delayed refunds. They declined.

But after failing for years to take action, the VA suddenly issued a press release on May 13, just days before TEGNA’s first report was released. The VA announced major reform efforts are underway. The release also said VA is conducting an ongoing internal review looking at millions of loans dating back to 1998 to determine if additional refunds are needed.

Watch the original investigation below:



The OIG investigation reviewed loans made in 2012 through 2017. It determined nearly 73,000 veterans had improper funding fees adding up to $286 million. Some of those veterans did receive the refunds they deserved. The study says approximately 19,000 veterans – roughly one in four – received refunds totaling $97 million. However, the review team estimated the VA still owed approximately 53,200 veterans refunds totaling $189 million.

The VA managers who sat on the problem blamed their failure to notify veterans on “competing priorities” including processing high volumes of applications.

To that point, the OIG investigative team wrote, “…their priorities should have included issuing funding fee refunds to exempt veterans and implementing controls to minimize or detect future inappropriate charges.”

The OIG report also states the Under Secretary for Benefits “indicated that the financial impact to veterans is minimal when amortized over the life of a loan.”

Getting refunds

Impacted veterans like Andrew Ganfield don’t agree with that sentiment.

“It’s 10-grand off the principal of my mortgage,” said Ganfield. ""That’s a big deal!""

Ganfield is one of the veterans who called the VA loan center and demand a refund after seeing TEGNA’s first report about the funding fee overcharges.

A VA employee called him back leaving a voicemail stating he appeared to be eligible to have that $10,197 refunded and applied to his loan balance.

Listen to the voicemail Andrew received from the VA below:

If you think you may be entitled to a refund of the funding fee, contact the VA Loan Center at 1-877-827-3702.

Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China,https://www.npr.org,['Sasha Ingber'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740412768/ex-state-department-worker-gets-40-months-in-prison-for-secret-dealings-with-chi,"Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China

Enlarge this image toggle caption Luis M. Alvarez/AP Luis M. Alvarez/AP

A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for concealing her interactions with two Chinese intelligence agents, along with the extravagant gifts they gave her in exchange for government information.

Candace Claiborne began to work as an office management specialist at the State Department in 1999, according to court documents. She had a top secret security clearance and served overseas in such cities as Baghdad, Beijing and Shanghai.

But she ignored her responsibility to report foreign contacts, prosecutors said as they announced her sentence on Tuesday.

""Claiborne was entrusted with privileged information as a U.S. government employee, and she abused that trust at the expense of our nation's security,"" Acting Assistant Director John Selleck of the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a statement. ""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face,"" he added.

Over the course of five years, Chinese agents allegedly gave Claiborne and her family ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in gifts and perks – including wired cash, a monthly stipend, overseas trips, tuition at a Chinese fashion school and an apartment that was fully furnished. In exchange for the gifts, Claiborne gave them a window into the State Department's inner workings through copies of internal documents about dignitary visits and other topics.

Prosecutors said she told a co-conspirator that the agents were ""spies"" and wrote in her journal that she could ""Generate 20k in 1 year"" by working with one of the agents.

Federal public defender David Walker Bos, Claiborne's attorney, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Her arrest came in March 2017 after a sting operation in January of that year. An FBI agent, posing as a Chinese agent, approached Claiborne on a street in Washington, D.C. She welcomed him to her home and their lengthy discussion ended with the undercover agent thanking her for helping the ""Ministry,"" NPR previously reported.

After the arrest, she pleaded not guilty to charges of obstruction and making false statements to the FBI. In April 2019, she pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges.

A judge ordered Claiborne detained pending sentencing, but she requested to self-surrender on June 5, the document stated.

In addition to a 40-month prison sentence, Claiborne received three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

Her sentence comes after former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty this spring to spying for China – and as U.S. officials have warned that Chinese espionage is the country's most serious security threat."

DHS reopening Tornillo holding facility but will turn it into an ICE detention center: Officials,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Washington Examiner Anna Giaritelli'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-reopening-tornillo-holding-facility-but-will-turn-it-into-an-ice-detention-center-officials,"TORNILLO, Texas — The Homeland Security Department will open an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center for adults in the coming weeks in the space outside Customs and Border Protection's Tornillo port facility, which was the center of protests last summer as a holding site for unaccompanied children, according to two Border Patrol officials with knowledge of the operation.

Construction was underway Saturday afternoon when the Washington Examiner passed through the Customs and Border Protection port of entry, now known as the Marcelino Serna Port of Entry. The town of Tornillo sits 30 miles southeast of downtown El Paso, Texas.

A large metal frame, comparable to the ones used for the massive white tents in Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas, began going up this week, though officials have not decided whether to use tents or modular homes, one source said.

The structure that will be used as the tent frame was being installed Saturday. (Washington Examiner/Anna Giaritelli)

""That place is only supposed to hold adults. No Border Patrol will be working there, but I guarantee it's going to be a disaster,"" the first official wrote in a text.

""Its going to open the end of this month into early next month,"" the second official said.

Last summer, CBP stood up a Border Patrol-operated outdoor detention center for unaccompanied children to be housed while they awaited transfer to Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. The facility is not a Border Patrol station or forward-operating base, but sector officials opted to use the adjacent land to put up dozens of tents, which housed bunk beds for children.

The camp was set up during a wave of family separations late last spring and activists from around the country showed up outside the government property to protest for months children being held, including those who arrived on their own and those who were taken away from parents. It was closed down in January as apprehension numbers in El Paso began to spike.

""There were a lot of activists, a lot of protests. So they said, 'We don’t want this. We’re gonna shut this down,'"" the second official said.

The new temporary facility will house approximately 2,500 people, likely waiting to be deported or who have made asylum claims but were not released by Border Patrol.

A statement released by CBP spokesman Roger Maier to media outlets states it will serve as overflow for Border Patrol stations. However, CBP data shows the number of single adults taken into custody in the region dropped 30% from May to June, prompting questions for why the sector would move now to put up a supplemental tent facility for Border Patrol if the numbers are declining."
DOE may have mistakenly shipped dangerous nuclear materials to Nevada,https://www.reviewjournal.com,"['Las Vegas Review-Journal', 'The Associated Press']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/doe-may-have-mistakenly-shipped-dangerous-nuclear-materials-to-nevada-1707928/,"The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled into Nevada.

The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled as low-level radioactive waste into Nevada in dozens of shipments over the past six years.

The shipments started in 2013 and stopped in December 2018. They were supposed to send only low-level radioactive waste from the department’s Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to the Nevada National Security Site, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, for secure disposal.

But on July 3, the Energy Department informed Nevada officials, that reactive material — which might be unstable under normal conditions and may have violent reactions when combined with other substances — may have been included in those shipments.

Gov. Steve Sisolak, as well as Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, sent Energy Secretary Rick Perry a letter two days later spelling out their concerns. They also expressed frustration over the latest error, which comes on the heels of the department’s decision last year to ship a half-metric ton of weapons grade plutonium to the security site and not disclose it until months after the fact.

‘Egregious acts’

“These egregious acts — whether acts of negligence or indicative of something else — are unconscionable and have potentially put the health and safety of Nevadans and our environment at unacceptable risk,” the letter said.

A Department of Energy spokesperson said there were nine shipments during that time frame that included 32 total containers of waste. Earlier in the day state officials had said that they were originally told there were 32 total shipments, and that the revised numbers released by the Energy Department were “significantly different than the info provided during DOE’s briefing to Governor Sisolak.”

The Energy Department confirmed Wednesday that shipments sent to the security site were not in compliance with its waste acceptance criteria, but said they posed no safety or health risk.

“The components that were shipped pose no risk to the safety and health of the general public or workers at the facility at NNSS. The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” the department said in a statement.

The DOE also said that planned future shipments from the Tennessee facility have been “temporarily suspended,” and that Perry has directed staff to initiate a department-wide assessment of all shipping policies and procedures.

Nevada’s congressional delegation condemned both the Energy Department and Perry Wednesday for the errors, with Rep. Dina Titus calling the shipments “a new low.”

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Titus said in a statement.

Rep. Steven Horsford went so far as to call for Perry to resign from his post.

“Secretary Perry has repeatedly disrespected the people of Nevada and eroded the public trust in his ability to abide by established rules for waste disposal. His failure to disclose these actions amount to their lying to a federal judge, our Nevada congressional delegation and our state’s governor repeatedly about his agency’s activities in our state. Secretary Perry must resign immediately,” Horsford said in a statement.

Cortez Masto and Rosen, in a joint statement, said they would work to hold the government accountable for the shipments.

“Yet again, the DOE has violated its mission, broken Nevadans’ trust and failed to follow its own compliance procedures,” the statement reads. “We intend to immediately determine whether the mixed waste shipped to Nevada poses a hazard to the health and safety of Nevadans and will take every action necessary to hold the DOE accountable.”

And Rep. Susie Lee weighed in as well. “The continued carelessness with our safety is exactly the concern of every Nevadan who is told that we should welcome the storage of nuclear waste in our own backyard,” she said. “It’s clear that the Department of Energy does not take Americans’ health, safety, or security into consideration before making decisions. On behalf of every Nevadan, I am demanding answers from the DOE about how this could possibly happen and demanding the swift removal of this material from our state.”

Top officials briefed

On Tuesday, the governor and members of his senior staff met with top federal officials, including National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, for a pair of in-person briefings at the Energy Department’s North Las Vegas offices. One briefing was unclassified, while a subsequent classified meeting followed that only Sisolak and top Nevada Department of Environmental Protection officials were privy to.

Sisolak learned of the error in a phone call with Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who told the governor that the shipments had been incorrectly labeled and “may contain a reactive material,” according to the letter sent last week.

“Such waste has never been approved for disposal at the NNSS,” the letter said.

The security site has operated as a permanent disposal location for what the federal government classifies as low-level nuclear waste, which can include rags, clothing, construction debris, filters and other equipment contaminated through exposure to radioactive material.

The governor’s office said that the Energy Department has not yet confirmed that the shipments contained any reactive materials, which Sisolak’s office said “would trigger additional safety concerns and run afoul of existing state permits and federal statutes governing the waste disposal mission at NNSS.”

The site also takes in some “mixed low-level” waste, which contains both low-level waste and hazardous waste materials — things like garbage, sludge and other discarded solid waste materials — so long as the reactive material has been neutralized. The NNSS does not accept mixed waste with any sludge, liquids or pressurized vessels, according to the DOE spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the canisters shipped from Tennessee contained what the department refers to as “squibs,” — small, pressurized devices designed to remotely cut wires — which violates the NNSS’ waste acceptance agreement.

Intended for separate facility

Because it includes hazardous material, the mixed-waste is supposed to be handled separately at a dedicated facility at the security site where it is processed. The mixed-level waste is buried in lined trenches as a precaution, whereas low-level waste is buried in unlined trenches.

But the shipments sent between 2013 and 2018 were not properly categorized, which means the the federal government does not know which were low-level waste and which possibly contained dangerous hazardous materials.

Beyond violating the site’s own waste acceptance criteria agreement, not knowing the type of waste that is being stored at the security site could be dangerous for the site’s estimated 3,000 employees as well as the surrounding ecosystem. Materials are classified as hazardous because they are “known to be harmful to human health and the environment when not managed properly, regardless of their concentrations,” according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.

"USDA Makes Few Changes In Corn, Soybean Production Thursday",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-drops-us-corn-acreage-market-goes-up-thursday,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The USDA made little changes for U.S. corn and soybean production and ending stocks estimates in its July monthly report released Thursday.

As a result, the markets dropped initially. However, since the 11:00 a.m. release, the farm markets have recovered.

At the close, the Sep. corn futures finished 9 1/4¢ higher at $4.44 1/4. Dec. corn futures finished 8 1/2¢ higher at $4.48.



Aug. soybean futures are 4 1/2¢ higher at $8.99. November soybean futures finished 4 1/2¢ higher at $9.17 3/4.

Sep. wheat futures closed 16 3/4¢ higher at $5.21 1/2.

August soymeal futures settled $1.70 per short ton higher at $312.40. August soy oil futures closed $0.09 higher at 28.18¢ per pound.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.20 lower, the U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 150 points higher.

Corn

In its July Crop Production Report the USDA pegged the U.S. 2019 corn production at 13.875 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 13.3 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 13.68 billion.

The U.S. 2019 corn yield is estimated at 166 bushels per acre vs. the trade’s estimate of 164 bu./acre and the USDA’s previous estimate of 166 bu./acre.

Soybeans

For soybeans, the U.S. 2019 production is pegged at 3.84 billion bushels vs. the trade’s estimate of 3.871 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 4.15 billion.

The USDA sees the U.S. soybean yield averaging 48.5 bu./acre vs. the trade’s expectation of 48.4 bu./acre and the governmental agency’s previous estimate of 49.5.



U.S. 2018/19 Ending Stocks

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. 2018/19 corn ending stocks at 2.34 billion bushels vs. the trade’s estimate of 2.21 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 2.19 billion.

For soybeans, the old-crop ending stocks were estimated at 1.05 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 1.05 billion and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.07 billion.

U.S. 2019/2020 Ending Stocks

For corn, the new-crop ending stocks are pegged at 2.01 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 1.589 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.67 billion.

For soybeans, new-crop ending stocks are estimated at 795 million bushels vs. the trade’s expectation of 816 million bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.045 billion bushels.

USDA pegged the U.S. new-crop wheat ending stocks at 1.00 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectation of 1.031 billion and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.072 billion.

World 2018/19 Ending Stocks

In its report Thursday, the USDA pegged the world corn ending stocks at 328 million metric tons vs. the trade’s expectation of 327 million mt. and its June estimate of 325 mmt.

For soybeans, world ending stocks are estimated at 113 mmt. vs. the trade’s estimate of 113 mmt. and the USDA’s June estimate of 112 mmt.

The world wheat stocks are pegged at 275 mmt. vs. the trade’s expectation of 275 mmt. and the USDA’s June estimate of 276 mmt.

Trade Response

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that on the surface, today’s USDA/WASDE report showed some tightening of wheat supplies versus last month, but overall global supplies of wheat are more than adequate.

""The underlying story in today’s report is definitely the global tightening of the soybean balance sheet, with global bean stocks down over 7% and global production down over 9%. Global usage of soybeans is projected higher, even in the face of the swine flu pandemic in Asia. All eyes will be on the August WASDE for more clarity around yields and acres, which are the big unknown variables right now,"" Gilbertie says.

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the WASDE report's world wheat production causing increased U.S. export demand potential was the bullish highlight.

""USDA used the June acres for corn and beans and that led to reduced beans and increased corn production estimates that no one thinks is accurate. The naysayers might be right. We pivoted to weather right away, as July is supposed to be hot and dry. These crops are so far behind that hot and dry in July could really hurt the corn and maybe the beans. Reversal day in the corn, so maybe we got some upside coming tomorrow and next week."""
Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

DOD wants to place virtual sensors in AWS’s commercial cloud for a secure connection,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/aws-dod-sensors-scca-cloud-security/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify that the sensors in use are virtual.

Regardless of how the ongoing $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud procurement plays out in the next month or so, the Defense Information Systems Agency is prepping for more adoption of Amazon Web Services’ commercial cloud.

DISA issued a sources sought solicitation Tuesday saying that it plans to integrate its Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) into AWS’s Secret Region, which is approved to host Department of Defense data and services up to impact level 6 for Secret-level classified information.

To do so, DISA will place software-based, firewall-like virtual sensors in AWS’s cloud “to monitor DoD workloads hosted therein. These sensors inspect traffic to and from those DoD workloads and route inspected traffic to the [Defense Information System Network].”

The SCCA is essentially DISA’s model for securing the Department of Defense’s workloads hosted in the commercial cloud. The agency describes it as “a set of services that provides the same level of security the agency’s mission partners typically receive when hosted in one of the DISA’s physical data centers.”

To be clear, this solicitation doesn’t mean the Pentagon is buying more commercial cloud services from AWS — though it certainly could play out that way if JEDI is awarded to AWS. However, it signals that DOD is looking to secure its connection to AWS’s cloud because it’s possible, if not likely, the two will do more work together.

“DISA does not determine where DoD mission owners chose to host their cloud-based DoD workloads but is charged with protecting those workloads in the CSPs they select,” the solicitation says. AWS “currently hosts existing DoD workloads, and has strong demand for additional DoD workloads.”

It’s likely DISA will soon look to other cloud providers next to integrate with the CSSA, as each commercial cloud provider military services do business with will need its own sensors. In this case, AWS, because of its more advanced security authorization, appears to be one of the first. “Those CSPs with existing and forecast workloads are the first to be integrated with the SCCA and have boundary defense established for those DoD workloads,” the solicitation says.

DISA wants to hear from AWS resellers by July 23. The eventual contract will be for a year with two optional renewal years.

This comes as the Pentagon’s JEDI procurement looms. AWS and Microsoft are currently faced off as the only contenders for the landmark commercial cloud contract. DOD CIO Dana Deasy said recently the Pentagon plans to make an award in August.

Meanwhile, Oracle has filed a lawsuit against the single-award nature and technical requirements of the contract; it also alleged that conflicts of interest between DOD and AWS steered the contract toward Amazon as the frontrunner to win. The Court of Federal Claims is hearing oral arguments on that protest this week. If the court were to rule in Oracle’s favor, it would certainly throw a wrench into the JEDI award timeline."

But the talks have bogged down amid acrimony between Democrats and the White House, and now Washington’s leaders run the risk of a fiscal pileup that could also imperil President Trump’s effort to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.

White House officials have said the debt ceiling must be raised by early September to ensure the government can pay its bills. And spending on many federal programs expires at the end of September, requiring a separate deal to prevent a government shutdown.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) this week and met Wednesday with GOP leaders, alongside acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, trying to forge a solution. Pelosi has made clear that any increase in the federal debt limit should come as part of a broader, two-year budget deal — an approach also favored by leading Senate Republicans — but it’s far from clear whether lawmakers and the administration will be able to reach such an agreement before Congress leaves town for its annual summer recess in August.

The debt ceiling “is something we’re having discussions about, updating the numbers and potentially the need to do something before everybody leaves” for the August recess, Mnuchin told reporters after exiting a meeting in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday evening.

“We just want it passed. We don’t care how it’s passed,” Mnuchin added when asked if the administration would prefer a stand-alone vote on the debt ceiling, as opposed to packaging it with a larger budget deal.

Mnuchin is serving as the White House’s emissary with Democrats because Pelosi has largely brushed aside most other senior White House officials.

She has dismissed Mulvaney, saying he has “no credibility” on spending issues because he pushed to shut down the government while serving in the House. She has also castigated Attorney General William P. Barr and accused him of lying to Congress, and made a cutting remark to the White House budget chief during a recent meeting .

The one bright spot had appeared to be her respect for U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who had spent more than a year carefully cultivating ties with top Democrats in a push to revamp NAFTA. But even that effort is now under extreme strain, as labor unions and vocal Democrats are demanding major changes that might be politically infeasible.

All these dynamics will test the withering relationship between Pelosi and Trump. Pelosi has tried to hold back her caucus from launching a formal impeachment proceeding against Trump, but she faces mounting pressure as the 2020 presidential campaign picks up steam.

Trump’s attacks against her became quite personal last month, when he called her a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” and a “disgrace” during a Fox News interview in France. That led Pelosi to effectively dismiss him, responding “I’m done with him” just a few days later.

Pelosi has also shown little regard for Trump’s top deputies. She has been unsparing in her public criticisms of Mulvaney. At one point during a budget negotiation in May, Pelosi snubbed acting budget director Russell Vought when he spoke up to reiterate a point. Turning to Vought, Pelosi asked, “What was your name again, dear?” according to an individual who witnessed the exchange and spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount it.

This unraveling could have real consequences for the country.

A think tank warned on Monday that the debt ceiling must be raised very soon or the government could risk missing payments on its bills by early September, but so far lawmakers and the White House have not been able to come up with a solution. Part of the problem, congressional aides and White House officials said, is a disconnect between senior administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill.

[GOP in disarray as budget impasse threatens shutdown, deep cuts — and default]

On Tuesday, before speaking on the phone with Mnuchin, Pelosi went so far as to dismiss the idea of meeting with administration officials at all while the budget impasse languishes, saying it would be pointless.

“I don’t see any reason to have a meeting. They know where we are. We’ve met, we’ve met, we’ve met,” Pelosi told reporters.

Pelosi’s comments left Republican lawmakers fuming and alarmed as they pointed to the series of approaching deadlines.

To cut a deal, White House officials have signaled an openness to increasing spending levels for next year, a position they did not hold a few months ago. But Democrats want to lock in more spending increases, and talks have broken down repeatedly. Congress is scheduled to be on recess in August and the first week of September, leaving scant time for action.

“We’re headed for a train wreck, so she’s either got to step up and start leading or just yield to the Senate, I suppose,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “I’m one, having served in the House, that’s a little bit sympathetic to the management challenges she has, but that’s the price of leadership.”

At the same time, Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had long hoped to see action on Trump’s revamped North American trade deal, a top promise from his campaign, before the recess. But that now looks barely feasible as House Democrats and organized labor press to reopen the deal to make changes including strengthened enforcement of environmental and labor standards, and to address provisions on prescription drugs they see as overly generous to industry.

Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a longtime Pelosi ally who has been vocal in the trade debate, dismissed the chances of a vote on a new trade deal before fall.

“It’s not going to happen,” DeLauro said. “It’s got to be right in the content, which is what we’re striving for. That doesn’t mean it’s not going to be done. But I don’t believe it will be done before the August recess.”

DeLauro added that Pelosi will be the one to make the call on when — and if — to move on the trade deal. “That’s her prerogative.”

In an interview at a CNBC event this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was waiting for a “green light” from Pelosi before moving forward. That ability of the speaker to single-handedly sink the North America trade deal by declining to put it on the floor has led to an increasingly desperate pressure campaign by Republican lawmakers and administration officials, including Vice President Pence, who has been traveling to Midwestern cities with manufacturing bases to make the case for the pact.

Trump had previously threatened Democrats that he would completely withdraw from the existing 1994 NAFTA deal if the updated version does not receive a vote, but he has not made that threat in a while as he tries to solicit more help from Pelosi.

“We need pressure on Speaker Pelosi to actually confirm that she will bring it up, and that she will be supporting this initiative,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) pleaded Tuesday.

But if Pelosi is feeling pressured to act swiftly on the trade deal, she has not shown it. At a recent news conference, she alluded to — and dismissed — the anxiety expressed by Republicans over allowing the pact to linger so long that it becomes fatally tied up in the 2020 presidential campaign and gets killed by campaign trail politics.

“The ambassador [Lighthizer] frequently will say, ‘We just don’t want to get this into the presidential,’ ” Pelosi said. “But that really doesn’t have anything to do with — it’s about the substance of the agreement, not the politics at all.”

For Pelosi, the mounting pressures over the budget, debt ceiling and trade arrive as she is coming off the most divisive episode of her speakership to date, last month’s vote on an emergency border spending bill that tore apart her caucus. After Pelosi caved to demands from moderates and put a Senate bill opposed by liberals on the floor for a vote, some liberals turned on the moderates in an ugly and very public display of disunity, unloading on them for supporting the legislation.

[House passes $4.6 billion border bill as leaders cave to moderate Democrats and GOP]

Although Pelosi has long commanded widespread bipartisan respect as a steely negotiator, the episode led some to question whether she will be able to steer a trade bill or a budget deal through her restive caucus. Some senior administration officials and Republicans have questioned whether Pelosi controls enough votes to deliver on a compromise.

“After watching how much difficulty she had passing the emergency supplemental, I don’t know where the votes are — and she knows that better than I would,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). “She’s a dealmaker but she’s also going to extract as much out of the deal as she can, so that’s why she’s not in a big hurry.”

Even as Pelosi has sought to keep the lid on liberal demands for impeachment proceedings against Trump, that task could get exponentially tougher next week, when former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will appear before Congress for the first time to testify.

Pelosi’s defenders, though, say that if deals on the budget or on trade prove elusive, the fault lies not with the House speaker but with a president who has proved to be an unreliable negotiator time and again. In past rounds of budget brinkmanship, Trump repeatedly shifted stances or undercut his own top lieutenants, leading Democrats to question whether they have a partner in the White House they can work with.

In private, Pelosi and Trump’s conversations on the border spending bill and other topics have been more cordial and productive than their public comments might suggest, aides say. But for the House speaker and the president, the coming battles over the budget and trade could prove the biggest test yet.

“If anybody can do it, it’ll be Nancy, and I think that over the years of her leadership she has proven that,” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. But, Roybal-Allard said, “I think this time is more challenging than ever.”"
"Roofing, paving, artisanal bread: Feds look to kick-start law that will free hundreds of inmates",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/11/first-step-act-doj-looks-prepare-inmates-early-release-prison-justice-reform/1691490001/,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Set in the foothills of the soaring Rocky Mountains, the mud-colored cluster of Depression-era structures has been a fixture in the federal penal system for decades.

Although just 10 miles south of Denver, notoriety has rarely found its way here except on the occasions when the Federal Correctional Institute Englewood’s worn cellblocks have housed the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich

Now, the 320-acre compound – distinguished by coils of razor wire and guard tower – is poised to play a leading role in a major criminal justice experiment.

Justice Department officials, including newly-installed Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, have cut a path to this unlikely place in recent days to tout a series of rehabilitation programs that could be key to supporting the early release and re-entry of waves of federal inmates set to be released as part of a criminal justice overhaul approved by Congress last year.

Inside Englewood, a culinary arts program is training aspiring chefs to pump out artisanal breads, pastries and cakes. An architectural drafting operation, manned by inmates, has produced designs for hundreds of chain restaurants and is assisting with a flood prevention project for the Port Authority of New York.

The prison’s signature enterprise, however, may be its most promising. Thirteen inmates are part of a roofing and road paving crew that travels the country more than seven months of the year tending to repairs and new construction at federal government installations scattered from the Great Lakes to New England. The crew members, many of whom have acquired valuable commercial drivers’ licenses while in prison and the skills to operate heavy machinery, have saved the federal government nearly $30 million in labor costs during the past three years, federal authorities said.

""I never thought I would get a chance to do something like this in prison,"" said Littlelee Ragsdale, a 36-year-old Wyoming man who is in the midst of a nine-year term for methamphetamine and heroin distribution. ""This a great opportunity for a real career outside of here. It's not just one of those jobs to get by. Re-entry (to the free world) is now a realistic goal.""

Leaning on the promise of Englewood’s programs and others like them scattered across the Bureau of Prisons system, Attorney General William Barr later this month is expected to unveil a tool that could shave years from the sentences of non-violent offenders like Ragsdale as part of the First Step Act, a sweeping law designed to reduce the federal prison population while easing offenders' transition back to their communities. Congress approved the law last year with support from both parties.

Barr is set to lay out rules on July 19 for evaluating federal inmates that could speed their path toward release. On the same day, a separate provision of the law will prompt the release of an estimated 2,200 offenders based on a re-calculation of the credit they receive for good behavior while in custody.

The new law represents a sea change in criminal justice policy which once advocated for the harshest punishments possible for offenders, including non-violent drug addicts who were swept up in en mass during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. The reversal, largely driven by spiraling prison costs and racial disparities in the enforcement of such punitive measures has garnered support of an unusual political alliance: At the vanguard is Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and the man he hopes to unseat, President Donald Trump.

""My visit here is an indicator of the fact that we are working very hard on the First Step Act to comply with both the law and what we think Congress and the people who sponsored the bill intended,"" Rosen said in an interview with USA TODAY following a two-hour walking tour of the Englewood campus. ""We're pushing it hard; I'm putting my personal attention on that. The attorney general is, too.""

More than 1,000 freed so far

The vast federal prison system has long been a drag on the government, soaking up more than a quarter of the Justice Department's $28 billion budget.

Even though its prison population has dropped since 2014, with 180,664 inmates, it is still the largest penal system in the United States. The system holds more than seven times as many inmates as it did in 1980, at the start of the nation's drug war and a ""tough-on-crime"" strategy that featured mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat drug offenses that doomed some inmates to more than two decades behind bars. More than 45% of federal inmates are now serving terms for some type of drug offense, by far the largest offense grouping in the system.

The First Step Act, signed into law by Trump last year, is an attempt to both chip away at the spiraling incarceration costs and better prepare offenders for release by driving down rates of recidivism.

The law gave judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent drug offenders, and eases some of the long mandatory-minimum sentences for convicts with only minor criminal records. It allows the government to more easily release seriously ill inmates and seeks to reconcile extreme sentencing disparities between people who sell crack compared to powdered cocaine. That provision alone has already freed 1,093 inmates and led to shorter sentences for 1,540 others.

Longtime advocates for such criminal justice reforms, who also have often been the fiercest critics of the Justice Department, are encouraged by the recent action but are wary of the challenges confronting full implementation of the law.

""I think they are doing their best to get prepared,"" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which has long highlighted the impact of harsh sentencing policy on families of the incarcerated. ""The real test will be in the implementation of all of the different pieces.""

Ring said more attention and money will be needed to support job training and drug treatment programs. He said his group remains disappointed that several classes of offenders will be excluded from qualifying for increased credits for good behavior that can be earned by participating in rehabilitation programs. Those groups include: inmates convicted of terrorism, human trafficking, sex crimes, weapons-related offenses, some fraud crimes and drug traffickers.

""There is going to be some frustration,"" Ring said, referring to the excluded classes of inmates.

Hugh Hurwtiz, acting director of the federal prison system, also acknowledged that the exclusions represent a looming inmate management test for prison staffers.

""How do you manage inmates who are getting the credits and those who are not? That will be a challenge as we roll this out,"" Hurwitz said.

The roll out also comes at a time when the prison system is grappling with persistent staffing shortages. To make up for a shortage of guards, officials have ordered teachers, nurses, kitchen workers and other staffers to serve as correctional officers.

The practice, known as augmentation, has drawn staff away from rehabilitation programs that officials are now touting. It also has prompted criticism from some members of Congress who regard the practice as potentially dangerous.

Rosen, the deputy attorney general, said provisions of the new law ""will put additional demands"" on prison staffers and he indicated that Justice was reviewing staffing across the BOP. But he believed that current personnel levels were not jeopardizing safety.

""Everyone who is trained to work at a federal prison learns to participate in the security role,"" he said. ""But we're looking at that and plan to do whatever makes sense.""

'I plan to start my own company'

Dressed in a neatly pressed prison uniform, Littlelee Ragsdale looked the part of an inmate eager to turn the page on a troubled life.

Ragsdale, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, did not hesitate last week when called on to address Englewood's special guest – the deputy attorney general of the United States – to describe how his experience on the prison's roofing and road paving crew could change his life when his sentence is complete in 2023.

""I have a wife and three girls,"" Ragsdale began, adding that his work as a heavy equipment operator had prepared him to assume a new role of responsibility for a waiting family. ""I plan to start my own company.""

Even with the help of Englewood's program, Ragsdale's path will not be easy.

Ragsdale's brush with law enforcement authorities in 2016 was not a one-time mistake.

The former oil field worker has a criminal record that dates to 2001, including burglary and car theft, according to a Wyoming prosecutor familiar with his current case. Past social media posts and photographs also appear to show a fascination with firearms, including an image in which he posed with array of hand guns and rifles.

""If you want re-integration to be successful, you need to think about re-integration at the point of intake in the prison system, not just at the end,"" said Jeff Mellow, a professor of criminal justice at New York's John Jay College.

""When they are ready to leave, you really want to make sure that the first 90 days go smoothly. If they keep hitting that wall in a search for housing or a job many will eventually give up. You only have to think about people who make New Year's resolutions. How long do they last? To be successful post-release, it's so important to have all the resources in place.""

Loreen Targos, an EPA employee in Chicago, unfurled a banner on stage next to Wheeler reading, “I care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health and climate change. Do you?”

Targos was on stage with the rest of a team being honored for cleaning up refinery waste near Muskegon Lake in Michigan.

released by American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, based in the Great Lakes region, Targos can be heard asking Wheeler if he supports a fair contract for EPA workers.

EPA employees have been outraged by a recent contract that went into effect Tuesday that remains unsigned by union leaders and scales back union protections.

In an interview with The Hill, Targos said Wheeler did briefly respond to her.

“I did look at him and ask him and ask if he was going to support a fair contract and he said something along the lines of agency talking points of ‘We tried to come to the bargaining table but you guys refused.’”

The fight between the EPA and the union began over how much of the contract was even negotiable. The EPA wanted to renegotiate the entire contract, while the union wanted to renegotiate a narrower slice.

Under the latest contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent. It also changes how employees can arbitrate their grievances.

Targos said the new contract was “unilaterally imposed.” The AFGE has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA.

“There was all this pomp and circumstance to highlight the good work of EPA employees,” Targos said. “Why take away the conditions that supported such award-winning work?”

The EPA said it issued the new contract after years of fruitless negotiations.

“Administrator Wheeler was proud to host the National Honor Awards ceremony for the first time in 10 years and recognize the outstanding achievements of more than 700 EPA staff,” a spokesman told The Hill. “This collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired 12 years ago, the Trump EPA has worked with AFGE for the past two-and-half years to reach a new CBA and EPA is not the party refusing to come to the negotiating table.”

Targos said a security officer stopped her later and asked if she was actually an EPA employee.

“When I said yes he asked if I was really here to receive an award for that team and if I had just snuck on stage, so I said, ‘Yes I was in that group and supposed to get an award with that team,’” she said.

Targos said she was hoping to get more of a response from Wheeler.

“There’s always a part of you that hopes they will be better than what they say about them in the media, and it’s a sad thing to always be disappointed and realize, 'Oh you’re as bad as they say you are.'”"
