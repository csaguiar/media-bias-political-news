‘Using the Lord’s name in vain’: Evangelicals chafe at Trump’s blasphemy,https://www.politico.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/12/trump-evangelicals-blasphemy-profanity-1456178,"President Donald Trump's frequent use of language taboo to many Christians has gotten him in a tight spot with evangelicals. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO white house ‘Using the Lord’s name in vain’: Evangelicals chafe at Trump’s blasphemy A Trump-supporting West Virginia state senator who represents many evangelicals got three phone calls from constituents complaining about Trump’s profanity after a recent rally.

Paul Hardesty didn’t pay much attention to President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., last month until a third concerned constituent rang his cell phone.

The residents of Hardesty’s district — he’s a Trump-supporting West Virginia state senator — were calling to complain that Trump was “using the Lord’s name in vain,” as Hardesty recounted.

“The third phone call is when I actually went and watched his speech because each of them sounded distraught,” said Hardesty, who describes himself as a conservative Democrat.

Here’s what he would have seen. Trump crowing, “they'll be hit so goddamn hard,” while bragging about bombing Islamic State militants. And Trump recounting his warning to a wealthy businessman: “If you don't support me, you're going to be so goddamn poor.”

To most of America, the comments went unnoticed. Instead, the nation was gripped after the rally by the moment when a “send her back” chant broke out as Trump went after Somali-born Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, an American citizen. But some Trump supporters were more fixated on the casual use of the word “goddamn” — an off-limits term for many Christians — not to mention the numerous other profanities laced throughout the rest of the speech.

The issue has recently hit a nerve among those who have become some of the president’s most reliable supporters: white evangelicals — who comprise much of Hardesty’s district. The group was key to Trump’s 2016 win, helping bolster his standing in critical swing states, and Trump likely needs to maintain that support if he wants to win a second term. But some are growing fatigued with the irreverent language that often seeps into Trump’s rallies and official events.

“I’ve had people come to me and say, ‘You know I voted for [Trump], but if he doesn’t tone down the rhetoric, I might just stay home this time,’” Hardesty said in an interview, adding that he has yet to hear back from anyone inside the White House after urging the president in a formal letter to “reflect on your comments and never utter those words again.”

Coarse language is, of course, far from the president’s only behavior that might turn off the religious right. He’s been divorced twice, faced constant allegations of extramarital affairs, previously supported abortion rights and has stumbled when trying to discuss the specifics of religion, once saying “two Corinthians” instead of “Second Corinthians.” Yet to this point, Trump has maintained broad support from evangelicals, including the unwavering backing of prominent conservative Christian leaders.

“We all wish he would be a little more careful with his language, but it’s not anything that’s a dealbreaker and it’s not something we’re going to get morally indignant about,” said Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., one of Trump’s earliest religious supporters.

Trump’s penchant for profanity dates back decades — from guest appearances on ""The Howard Stern Show"" in the 1990s to a 2011 speech to Nevada Republicans where he dropped multiple F-bombs and cast Chinese officials as a bunch of “motherfuckers.” His unseemly language became a stump speech staple when he ran for president in 2016 and has continued into his presidency, both in public and behind closed doors.

For evangelicals, however, Trump’s indelicate language has frustrated religious fans who have otherwise been true blue supporters of his agenda. They agree with his social policies, praise his appointment of conservative judges and extol his commitment to Israel — often tolerating Trump’s character flaws for the continued advancement of all three. But when it comes to “using the Lord’s name in vain,” as Hardesty put it, “the president’s evangelical base might be far less forgiving.”

Two pro-Trump pastors, both of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, admitted in interviews that they’ve winced and cringed their way through some of the president’s more provocative speeches, or the ones that contained multiple expletives. One of the pastors said he was “appalled” by the president’s remarks at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in March, in which he accused his political rivals of trying to run him out of office with “bullshit” investigations and oversight actions.

“You know, I’m totally off script right now,” Trump boasted at the time. The rest of his speech was littered with cursing, as he promised to “keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country” and throw undocumented immigrants “the hell out.”

“I’m not going to get into private conversations, but I made sure he knew that type of rhetoric is unacceptable. This was not just an event for adults,” said one of the pastors, who is close with several members of the Trump administration.

“I think this president needs to be president to all of the people and realize that kids look up to him and adults look up to him,” said Hardesty. “Carrying that type of language from behind the presidential seal is offensive.”

To be sure, foul-mouthed figures are nothing new in modern politics. One of Trump’s 2020 rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, was caught calling the Affordable Care Act “a big fucking deal” at the bill’s signing in March 2010. Biden’s predecessor, Dick Cheney, told a Democratic senator to “fuck himself” on the Senate floor in 2004. Two other presidential hopefuls — Beto O’Rourke and Tulsi Gabbard — have used profanity in recent public statements, and countless more examples can be found in the presidential archives.

“Well, Jesus Christ, of course, he’s racist,” O’Rourke said of Trump just this week during an appearance on MSNBC.

The difference, though, is that Trump enjoys the support of the religious right — and losing the group’s support would be catastrophic for his reelection bid. About 80 percent of white evangelicals cast their ballots for Trump in 2016 and 61 percent of the broader evangelical voting bloc believes the U.S. is heading in the right direction under his administration, according to a 2018 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute.

Evangelicals are also more likely to vote than other demographic groups, and gravitate toward Republican candidates when they do. And in swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Michigan, evangelicals dominate the religious composition, eclipsing Catholics, mainline Protestants and other Christian denominations.

Several of the president’s most steadfast evangelical allies pushed back against concerns that Trump’s swearing could jeopardize this powerful voting bloc. At the very least, they said, it’s not an issue for them. Alveda King, a Fox News contributor and the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she’s inclined to extend grace to the president when he swears or makes inappropriate comments.

“I remember God’s love and mercy towards me,” she said.

Part of the reason Trump has previously escaped criticism for cursing is because his supporters were more drawn to the perceived authenticity of his blunt statements than they were offended by the vulgarity, Melissa Mohr, the author of a book on swearing, wrote for Time in June 2016.

“When we hear people swear, we often assume that their words spring from a deep well of real feeling,” Mohr said at the time.

But some curse words could have adverse effects for Trump, particularly with his evangelical audience.

“Carelessly invoking the Lord’s name in a fit of anger is one thing,” said one of the pro-Trump pastors, quickly adding that he would not encourage such behavior. “But,” he continued, “repeatedly doing it for shock value … that does raise questions about the president’s respect for people of faith.”"
Trump Rule Targets Legal Immigrants Who Rely on Food Stamps and Other Aid,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Eileen Sullivan', 'Michael D. Shear']",08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/us/politics/trump-immigration-policy.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will penalize legal immigrants who rely on public programs, such as food stamps and government-subsidized housing, as part of a sweeping new policy to slow legal immigration into the United States and reduce the number of immigrants who are granted permanent legal status.

The move will have the greatest impact on poor immigrants who are living in the country legally and are receiving public benefits from the government, forcing them to make a choice between accepting financial help and living and working in the country legally. It will probably not affect immigrants who already have green cards.

The United States wants immigrants who can support themselves, according to the rule, not those who “depend on public resources to meet their needs,” according to the new rule.

The regulation, which is scheduled to go into effect in 60 days, will provide the Trump administration a powerful new tool to narrow the demographic of people who come to live and work in the country."
"Scaramucci no longer backs Trump's reelection, says change may be needed at top of ticket",https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/anthony-scaramucci-donald-trump-reelection-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Anthony Scaramucci , a former White House communications director who has frequently defended President Donald Trump on television, said Monday he no longer supports Trump's reelection bid and that the top of the 2020 Republican presidential ticket may need to be replaced.

The comments to CNN's John Berman come following a weekend in which Scaramucci and Trump traded barbs. The former hedge fund manager has increasingly criticized Trump's racist rhetoric as well as his recent visits to the scenes of mass shootings

Asked by Berman on ""New Day"" if he was ""no longer an active supporter of President Trump and his reelection bid,"" the former Trump loyalist replied, ""I think that's pretty obvious from over the weekend.""

""The guy's actually dissembling a little bit, and he's sounding more and more nonsensical. And, you know, we're sort anesthetized to it,"" he added, referring to the President's rhetoric and behavior.

Scaramucci's public break with Trump makes him the latest loyalist to cut ties with the President. Some other high-profile allies, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and personal attorney Michael Cohen, have also distanced themselves from Trump after once vigorously defending him in public.

Trump appeared to be angry over the weekend with Scaramucci after he called the President's recent visits to the grief-stricken cities of El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, following two mass shootings a ""catastrophe.""

Asked Monday if he was calling for changing the Republican ticket, Scaramucci replied, ""Well, I'm calling for it to be considered, yes.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" said Scaramucci, who didn't name a potential replacement candidate, instead saying, ""Let's watch how this unfolds.""

The former aide said that although he believes Trump's policies are ""very, very good for the American people,"" the President's ""rhetoric is so charged and so divisive that we have to all just take a step back now and say, 'what are we doing, actually?'""

""He goes after individuals as the President of the United States on his Twitter account, OK, which incites hate, which incites death threats,"" he said, adding later, ""The racially charged comments, the divisive tweeting, the nonsense coming from the President is not helping the country.""

In a tweet following the CNN interview, Scaramucci said he had held off on distancing himself from Trump because he ""tried to see best"" in him ""based on private interactions and select policy alignment.""

'Eventually he turns on everyone'

On Saturday, Trump ripped into Scaramucci in a pair of tweets, writing that the former aide, who served in the administration for 11 days in 2017, was fired ""from a position that he was totally incapable of handling."" Noting that Scaramucci regularly appears on TV, he added: ""Anthony, who would do anything to come back in, should remember the only reason he is on TV, and it's not for being the Mooch!""

The President's tweets came several says after Scaramucci said last week on MSNBC that Trump's recent visits to El Paso and Dayton were a ""catastrophe."" On Monday, he told Berman of Trump's trips, ""the only thing (Trump) was doing in those areas was talking about himself and praising himself and crowd sizes. And so it just -- one day after the next it gets worse and worse and worse.""

Responding in a tweet on Sunday to Trump's attacks, Scaramucci said that although he's ""fully"" supported Trump over the last three years, ""Recently, he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable,"" adding, ""Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR

This is a story about two small-town Virginia churches with the same name, but two very different congregations. They've each found themselves caught up in controversy tied to President Trump's racist rhetoric. NPR's Sarah McCammon recently visited both congregations.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR

A welcome sign on the way into town reads ""Historic Appomattox: Where Our Nation Reunited."" But here in Appomattox, where the Civil War ended more than 150 years ago, there are still reminders of division.

Not far away, a sign posted in front of Friendship Baptist Church reads ""AMERICA: LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT.""

Pastor Earnie Lucas said he posted that message on his church sign several weeks ago. It was around the same time that President Trump tweeted an attack on four Democratic members of Congress — all women of color — saying they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

Lucas, 85, is white and has been a pastor in this community for decades. He defends his sign and expresses anger about the response it has received online and in news reports.

""Don't talk to me about that flag out yonder, or that sign out yonder!"" he thundered from the pulpit. ""This is America! And I love America!""

Lucas asks if anyone in the small, all-white congregation is ""from Yankee land."" No one raises their hand.

""The letters that came from north of the Mason-Dixon Line, I am sorry to say, those folk don't know how to talk,"" Lucas said. ""You're talking about some vile, wretched language. And where they told me to go, and how long to stay — they were filthy in their conversation.""

Lucas said he has gotten threats of violence, even death, since putting up the sign. He also got letters of support, including some donations, from around the country.

Local media initially reported that several members of the congregation had staged a walkout in protest — or out of fear of the backlash. But last weekend, Lucas said most of the regulars had returned.

""I had no ill intent against anyone — around here or in the state of Virginia,"" Lucas said. ""I was talking about people who have come over here illegally and want to tear the place up.""

During the service, he mentioned the recent mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead. But afterward, he said he doesn't believe news reports that the white shooter was targeting Latinos. Lucas also said he does not believe analyses suggesting that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit violent crimes than others living in the United States.

Lucas doesn't see his words, or the president's, as racist.

""I think this idea of racism has been blown out of proportion,"" Lucas said. ""I really do. We've got some sorry people, black and white ... but I don't pay any attention to that. If a man comes to me and behaves himself, we get along good together, I'll go to bat for him, any way I can.""

""I don't want any Muslims in America""

One of Lucas' church members, Dianne Cook, 69, said she agrees with the message on her church sign, and with her pastor. She said Trump was right to criticize the four Democratic congresswomen, who include the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.

""Where'd their parents come from? Are they Americans?"" Cook asked. ""Just because she was born in America does not make her American.""

""Doesn't it?"" I asked. ""Doesn't it legally, though, under the Constitution?""

""Under the Constitution, yes,"" Cook acknowledged, then paused. ""But I don't know how to express that, to make you understand that I wish she, I wish they, well — I don't want any Muslims in America.""

""We are not that church""

Two hours away in Hopewell, Va., is another Friendship Baptist Church. The congregation is predominantly black, and the members are experiencing this moment very differently from the Friendship Baptist congregants in Appomattox.

Sitting in his church office, Pastor Norwood Carson said his secretary has received angry calls from people confused about their name.

""We gave a standard response to all of them,"" Carson said. ""'You are calling the Friendship Baptist Church of Hopewell. The church that loves God, loves others, and serves the community. We are not that church that says, 'America Love it or Leave it.' ""

Carson, 59, said the meaning of that sign is clear. ""Obviously, it's a racist statement,"" he said. ""But to find out it came from a church just really took me for a loop.""

Carson said he'd like to talk to Pastor Lucas at Friendship Baptist in Appomattox, and try to understand more about what motivated that sign. Lucas said he's open to the conversation.

""This is not who we are""

Elaine Thomas, 70, is a longtime church member at Hopewell's Friendship Baptist Church. She was a teenager growing up outside Richmond, Va., at the height of the civil rights movement.

""My husband and I were looking forward to [having] peace, security, watching our grandchildren grow — now our great-grandchildren,"" Thomas said. ""And we had no idea that we would have to start to worry about them being exposed to the types of things that we saw and that we heard when we were young.""

Thomas said President Trump is responsible for stoking renewed racism in America.

""This is not who we are,"" Thomas said. ""This may have been how we were at some point. ... But this is not who we are right now. We've come too far to turn around and go back, and we're not going back."""
"3 Big Things Today, August 12",https://www.agriculture.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.agriculture.com/news/3-big-things-today-august-12,"1. Soybeans, Grains Lower Overnight Ahead of WASDE

Soybeans and grains were lower in overnight trading ahead of today’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) Report.

The USDA report is due out at noon in Washington.

Soybean area is pegged at about 81 million acres while yield is seen at around 47.6 bushels an acre, leaving production at about 3.8 billion bushels, according to a Reuters survey. Last month, the USDA said it expected planted acreage at 80 million, yield of 48.5 bushels an acre and total output of 3.845 billion bushels.

Corn acres are pegged at around 88 million with yield of 164.9 bushels an acre, resulting in production of 13.193 billion bushels, the survey showed.

The USDA in July forecast corn planted area of 91.7 million acres, yield of 166 bushels an acre, and output of 13.875 billion bushels.

Soybean inventories in the marketing year that ends on August 31, 2020, are expected to come in around 821 million bushels, while corn stockpiles are forecast at about 1.62 billion bushels, the company reported.

Soybean futures for November delivery fell 5¾¢ to $8.86 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal lost $1.30 to $302.40 a short ton, while soybean oil dropped 0.24¢ to 29.71¢ a pound.

Corn futures for December delivery declined 3¢ to $4.14¾ a bushel overnight.

Wheat for September delivery fell 4¢ to $4.95½ a bushel, while Kansas City futures lost 3½¢ to $4.30 a bushel.

2. Speculative Investors Slash Net Longs in Corn, Increase Bearish Positions in Beans

Speculative investors cut their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in corn to the lowest level in more than two months while raising their bearish bets on soybeans.

Money managers held net-long positions of 68,086 corn futures contracts as of August 6, down from 105,907 contracts a week earlier and the smallest amount since the seven days that ended on May 28, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In soybeans, investors increased their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, to 76,318 futures contracts last week, the CFTC said in a report.

That’s up from 55,160 contracts the previous week and the largest bearish position in beans since the seven days that ended on June 11.

Investors are less bullish on corn and more bearish on beans amid an ongoing trade war with China that has no end in sight.

Speculators also increased their bearish positions in hard red winter wheat, bumping their net shorts to 22,942 futures contracts from 16,283 contracts a week earlier. That’s the biggest bearish holdings in hard red winter futures since mid-June.

Investors cut their net-long positions in soft red winter wheat to 7,121 futures contracts last week, about half the previous week, the CFTC said.

The weekly Commitment of Traders Report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

3. Heat Blasts Much of South-Central U.S., Flood Warnings Issued in Missouri, Illinois

A heat wave is blasting much of the south-central U.S. as excessive heat warnings and advisories are in effect in several states.

In eastern Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, and parts of northern Louisiana, an excessive heat warning is in effect starting at 1 p.m. this afternoon until 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.

Temperatures will be in the upper 90s today and tomorrow with heat indexes of about 115˚F., the NWS said in a report early this morning. Outdoor activity is not advised.

In several counties in eastern Missouri and western Illinois, meanwhile, a flash flood warning is in effect after thunderstorms dropped several inches of rain in the region.

As much as 3 inches of rain fell in an hour this morning, with another 3 inches possible in the area, the NWS said in its report.

“Thunderstorms north of a warm front will train and create flash flooding across parts of central and east-central Missouri as well as south-central Illinois,” the agency said. “Flash flooding may cause road closures and lead to very rapid rises in smaller creeks and streams.”"

The California Democrat also commented on what motivates Trump voters and said most of them voted for the president because of promises he made, but that he's failed to deliver on.

""Here’s the thing. There are people who voted for him for a variety of reasons,"" she said earlier in the interview. ""And a lot of it had to do with the promises he made, which he has not delivered on because they were false promises.

""And he betrayed a lot of people. He came in saying he was going to help working families. Everyone from farmers to auto workers.""

Trump defended the DHS raids to reporters outside the White House on Friday and called them a ""very good deterrent"" to illegal immigration.

""I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent,"" he said.

The operation was carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday and resulted in the detention of 680 illegal immigrants. Agents targeted a food processing plant in Mississippi and swarmed the facility with federal search warrants in hand.

""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said in a statement.

""I commend these federal agents, our state and local law enforcement partners, and our federal prosecutors for their professionalism and dedication to ensure that those who violate our laws are held accountable.""

At around 6:50 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 1.695%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at around 2.201%.

Market focus is largely attuned to simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and called into question the next round of trade talks. It comes after the U.S. president said he would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. China responded by halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Last week, the U.S. accused China of being a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed the yuan to dip below the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.

On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set its daily midpoint for yuan trading — which determines the limits for its onshore movement — at 7.0211 per dollar. That was weaker than Friday's session, but stronger than market expectations.

On the data front, the Federal Budget for July is expected to be published at around 2 p.m. ET.

CLOSE Dozens of immigrant workers have been released a day after being detained in the largest immigration raid in a decade in the United States. AP

BEDMINSTER, N.J. – President Donald Trump's acting secretary of Homeland Security expressed regret Sunday for the timing of immigration raids that netted 680 workers at food processing plants in Mississippi, an operation that took place after a mass shooting that targeted Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.

""The timing was unfortunate,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

McAleenan said the long-planned raid received court approval before the operation that led to the arrests of 680 people, the majority of them Hispanic.

""That means those employers are just ignoring the law entirely in what they do,"" McAleenan said. ""That's why a judge gave us a warrant to go after them.""

McAleenan said the administration is aware that Hispanics feel targeted in the wake of the mass shooting Aug. 3 in El Paso that claimed at least 22 lives, days before the raids in Mississippi.

The Department of Homeland Security regards the El Paso shooting as an attack ""on our community"" at the U.S.-Mexican border and is working to address the threat of ""domestic terrorism,"" McAleenan told NBC News.

Asked whether authorities considered delaying the raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, McAleenan said, ""Something like this has been planned for over a year. This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issued by a judge, and ICE had to follow through on that. It was already planned and in motion.”

Only employees were arrested at the plants – not employers.

Officials said Thursday that 300 people arrested during the raids were released.

""We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation,"" McAleenan said. ""You get a warrant from a federal judge with probable cause. You then go gather evidence at the sites. And then you look at the appropriate charges in concert with the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney to see how you proceed.""

Congressional Democrats said they are looking into events that led up to the raids in Mississippi.

In a letter to Matthew Albence, acting director of ICE, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., lamented that the raids stranded children of the workers who were arrested.

""At a time when this country is grieving due to two domestic terrorist shootings, your agency has instead seemingly deliberately disregarded its own long-standing guidelines and carried out another form of family separation,"" Thompson said.

After the attack in El Paso, another mass shooting that weekend in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.

""The blatant lack of planning and resulting chaos calls into question the true motivation behind these worksite enforcement operations,"" Thompson said.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, defended the operation on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""We still have to apply consequences, meaning enforce the rule of law, for those individuals that are here illegally against immigration law,"" he said.

State Dept. updates ‘anti-Semitism’ definition following Omar’s anti-Israel resolution,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-updates-definition-of-anti-semitism-following-omars-anti-israel-resolution,"The U.S. State Department recently revised its definition of anti-Semitism, in an apparent response to recent comments and actions by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The previous definition of anti-Semitism, issued in May, listed 10 examples. The revised definition now lists 11 examples, adding that anti-Semitism now includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.”

The leader of a U.S.-based pro-Israel organization praised the move last week.

HOUSE OVERWHLEMINGLY OKS RESOLUTION OPPOSING ISRAEL BOYCOTT IN RARE BIPARTISAN VOTE

“Kudos to @SecPompeo and Special Envoy Elan Carr,” Adam Milstein, a philanthropist and co-founder of the Adam and Gila Milstein Foundation, wrote on Twitter. “It’s more clear now, the BDS Movement is disgustingly Antisemitic.”

BDS refers to the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, whose supporters call for the withdrawal of financial support for the Israeli government in protest of the treatment of Palestinian people.

The State Department revision follows last month's overwhelming bipartisan 398-17 vote by the U.S. House of representatives to oppose an international effort to boycott Israel.

Omar's intention

Omar, who cast one of the 17 dissenting votes, countered with a resolution of her own, supporting the right to boycott foreign governments “to advocate for human rights abroad,” and likening the action to boycotts of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Her resolution did not mention Israel or the Palestinians. But she made her intention clear when she spoke with reporters.

“We are introducing a resolution … to really speak about the American values that support and believe in our ability to exercise our First Amendment rights in regard to boycotting,” Omar told Al-Monitor. “And it is an opportunity for us to explain why it is we support a nonviolent movement, which is the BDS movement.”

But several House Democrats gave Omar’s resolution little chance of passage.

“I can’t imagine that any committee is going to mark up or take seriously any pro-BDS resolution,” U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said last month.

“Am I worried about the overall BDS movement worldwide as an economic matter? No. As an effort to delegitimize Israel, of course. The comments here today are a tiny part of that delegitimizing effort.”

Petition to censure Omar, Tlaib

Meanwhile, the Washington-based American Center for Law and Justice recently launched an online petition, calling for Congress to censure Omar as well as her Democratic colleague, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, over rhetoric that the ACLJ describes as anti-Semitic.

“Rep. Omar said that support for Israel is ‘all about the Benjamins’ – a bigoted accusation that Jews control all the money,” the petition states. “She’s attacked Jews and anyone who supports Israel as having a dual allegiance – another anti-Semitic trope.

“Rep. Tlaib said she has a ‘calming feeling’ about the Holocaust,” the petition continues. “Someone espousing these bigoted views should not have access to classified information or sit on congressional committees such as the Foreign Affairs Committee.”

It states later: “Take action with us. Fight back against anti-Semitism. Demand Reps. Omar and Tlaib be removed from the committees and censured.”

US Department of Commerce Offering 6-Figure Salary to Crypto Expert,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Marie Huillet', 'Masao Akimoto']",08-12-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-commerce-offering-6-figure-salary-to-crypto-expert,"The United States Department of Commerce is looking to hire a computer scientist specializing in blockchain and identity management.

According to a job listing from Aug. 9, the federal agency is seeking someone with at least one year of specialized experience in developing blockchain infrastructure and conducting research into blockchain technologies, crypto ledgers and crypto contracts.

Focus on identity management and crypto tokens

The Department of Commerce’s listing hints at the future hire’s duties and responsibilities in general terms, revealing only that they will be tasked with research and development into potentially disruptive technologies at the department’s Information Technology Laboratory.

It notes that the candidate’s role will include a focus on the cybersecurity capabilities and requirements necessary for the successful implementation of emerging technologies.

Yet in its outline of the experience required of candidates, the listing indicates that identity management in connection with blockchain will apparently be of particular importance for the role.

Applicants should have experience with:

“National and global identity management programs and identity tokens” and in “standards and national and international standards bodies developing identity management, blockchain and identity token interoperability standards.”

The appointment is for a short-term vacancy — not to exceed one year — at a salary of up to $166,500.

Federal agencies step up blockchain activity

This April, Cointelegraph reported that the U.S. federal government is expected to raise its blockchain spending to $123.5 million by 2022 — an over 1,000% increase as compared with the $10.7 million it spent in 2017.

In June, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration — which forms part of the Department of Commerce — reached out for feedback on blockchain policy, as officials forecast an increasing focus on the technology in coming years.

The Department of Commerce has been responding to developments in the blockchain sector since 2016."
Trump Administration Moves to Decertify Outspoken Immigration Judges’ Union,https://www.nytimes.com,['Christina Goldbaum'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/immigration-judges-union-justice-department.html,"The pressure to hear more cases more quickly amounts to “psychological warfare,” Judge Tabaddor said last year.

Addressing some of the union’s concerns, the Justice Department has tried to tackle the backlog, which now totals more than 830,000 cases, by hiring more immigration judges. Judges appointed by President Trump now make up 43 percent of the nation’s immigration judges, a larger share than under any of his five predecessors, according to a recent analysis by The Associated Press. A large number of his appointees are former military or Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers, the analysis found.

But that hiring has not been accompanied by other necessary support, Judge Khan said.

“I can’t work alone, I am reliant on support staff,” said Judge Khan. “Right now there are two judges to one support staff person,” which has delayed the progress of cases despite the additional judges, she said.

The judges’ union plans to officially respond to the Justice Department’s petition once it receives official notification from the Federal Labor Relations Authority.

If the attempt to decertify the union is successful, it could leave judges without recourse for their already overwhelming workload, judges said.

“The union won’t be able to help judges with overall working conditions at a time when most all judges would tell you working conditions are worse now than they have ever been,” said Paul Schmidt, a former immigration judge.

Judge Khan called the Justice Department’s petition part of “a systematic attack on unions” representing federal employees under the Trump administration. Last year, Mr. Trump signed a series of executive orders that rolled back the workplace role of unions for at least two million federal workers and made it easier to fire them. The administration said the move would make the government more efficient.

The Justice Department’s recent petition will most likely prompt an investigation by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, according to a department spokesman."
Editorial: An EPA decision reviving Alaska’s Pebble Mine endangers Bristol Bay and a vibrant fishing economy,https://www.latimes.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-bristol-bay-salmon-trump,"Just five years ago the Environmental Protection Agency determined that a proposal to dig a massive open-pit copper and gold mine near southwest Alaska’s Bristol Bay — one of the world’s most important salmon fisheries — threatened an environmental disaster. So it issued rules to severely curtail the potential project.

What a difference an election makes. Shortly after President Trump’s appointee, Scott Pruitt, took over the EPA in 2017 he met with the chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership, owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals, and then just hours later rescinded the Obama administration directive to protect the sensitive wetland area from mining activities. Pruitt later backed off and sent the action for a fuller regulatory review — and then quit his job under a storm of criticism about ethical lapses.

But the EPA has continued Pruitt’s campaign to loosen environmental restrictions and greenlight controversial projects, and on Tuesday the agency announced that it would not use its veto authority under the Clean Water Act to block the mine. That frees the Army Corps of Engineers to decide whether or not to approve the project. (Interestingly, the Army Corps’ preliminary environmental analysis of the project was criticized as insufficient by a Seattle-based EPA official — the same one who, apparently under pressure from superiors in Washington, D.C., rescinded the Obama-era directive. Yes, it can make your head spin.)

Environmentalists, including Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Joel Reynolds, accuse the EPA of abandoning its own findings and opening the door for the Trump administration to deliver a “gift to a foreign mining corporation at the expense of Bristol Bay’s fish, aquatic resources and community.” We would add that the EPA has also abandoned common sense. Mining is an exceedingly messy endeavor which historically has ravaged landscapes and caused significant environmental degradation — just the kind of thing the EPA is supposed to protect against. The agency’s absurd decision to reverse itself and let the Pebble Mine permitting process proceed must be undone either through an unlikely reconsideration by the EPA, legal challenges, or, best yet, rejecting Trump and his cockamamie and dangerous approaches to economic development in the 2020 election .

What’s at stake in Alaska? The proposal is for an open-pit mine and support operations with a potential footprint as large as Manhattan, and a pit descending nearly three-quarters as deep as the Grand Canyon, according to an EPA analysis (which the developers have disputed). Even if it were only half that size, that is an extraordinary amount of environmental degradation at the mine site itself, which would include massive pits to hold millions of tons of mine waste and other leftovers of the mining process — much of it laden with toxic chemicals.

And the site is near two rivers that empty into Bristol Bay, which means that not only would the project destroy thousands of acres of near-pristine habitat and wetlands at the mining site, but it would also imperil the environmental health of Bristol Bay itself — something the Obama EPA recognized. As have the people of Alaska: 65% approved a measure in 2014 that gives the state Legislature veto power over future projects in the Bristol Bay watershed if it determines that the salmon fishery is at risk , a veto it ought to keep handy should federal regulators allow this mine to proceed.

There’s the friction point. Bristol Bay supports a vibrant, long-running economy based on a sustainable fishery — 14,000 jobs in a $1.5 billion-a-year economy, according to some estimates — as well as tourism and other non-extractive businesses. Allowing the mine to go forward would sacrifice the existing and more environmentally friendly economy for gold and copper extraction that could be disastrous for the environment.

The Trump administration is playing favorites here. Its affection for extractive industries has already put hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in the West in play for invasive mining leases for oil, gas, uranium and just about anything else of value the mining industry can find. And yes, many of these materials are vital to economic development, but the Trump administration has earned the nation’s skepticism over whether, in adopting policies and weighing proposed projects, it can be relied upon to shepherd our natural resources in a balanced, sustainable and sensible manner."
Minneapolis housing authority leads county in evictions,http://www.startribune.com,"['Marissa Evans', 'Marissa.Evans Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-housing-authority-leads-county-in-evictions/535664982/,"The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority has gone to court to evict tenants more than 1,500 times in the past five years, making the county’s largest landlord also its biggest user of housing court, according to data compiled by Hennepin County.

The housing authority oversees more than 6,000 units across Minneapolis, providing homes for low-income residents who are often people with disabilities, older adults or people of color.

While emphasizing that it takes action only against a small number of its tenants, the housing authority is rethinking its approach to evictions amid a larger conversation in the city and across Minnesota over the fairness of the process and the long-term damage an eviction filing has for a prospective renter.

Public housing residents pay up to 30% of their income toward rent. But even with lower rent payments, housing authority officials and tenant advocates have found residents often fall behind due to job loss, reduced work hours or a health emergency.

The agency does not dispute the county’s data, but the numbers do not consider how officials work with residents until “practically at the very last minute to make sure that they stay housed,” said Tracey Scott, interim executive director for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority. “It doesn’t show the whole story about how we do workouts and how we do everything we can to support our residents in keeping their housing.”

Between 2014 and 2018, the agency obtained 462 eviction judgments against tenants and 1,070 that ended with a noneviction judgment, according to a Hennepin County website that tracks these court actions. The county data show the second-largest eviction filer is Huntington Place Apartments, a property in Brooklyn Park that has 834 units.

A noneviction judgment means a landlord may not have shown up for a hearing, the landlord and resident came to an agreement on paying the back rent, or a tenant may have successfully fought off eviction after withholding rent because of maintenance issues.

Tarnishing tenants’ history

Part of the problem with evictions is how long they stay on tenants’ records and how often landlords can use that against them, said Ellen Sahli, president of the Family Housing Fund, an organization focused on housing access and affordability in the Twin Cities.

While state law allows residents to pursue eviction expungements, tenant advocates say that process can be costly and time-consuming for low-income households, forcing them to forgo it altogether. Sahli said that’s why it’s important for landlords and tenants in financial distress to know in advance that assistance exists and agencies are there to make sure that help is readily available.

“Our goal is to eliminate eviction filings, which means we have to have the services and support in place before so that the family gets the kind of help they need to avert the filing completely,” Sahli said.

Luke Grundman, a managing attorney for housing issues at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, said that his public-housing clients are often confused by the housing agency’s letters or unclear about where to go for help. The organization talked to the housing authority about changing the wording of the letters, sending texts and reaching out to emergency contacts to communicate with residents.

“Many times people who are in housing court facing a [Minneapolis Housing Authority] eviction are genuinely surprised,” Grundman said. “They didn’t even realize it was happening. They didn’t realize they were at the stage where they could be homeless in a matter of days.”

The housing authority says residents are given plenty of notice before action is taken. It does not file an eviction against residents until the second month after they’re late and even then always offers a settlement during the court appearance. Residents are sent two letters before an eviction is filed. While residents may reach a settlement with the agency, they’ll also be responsible for paying back the $297 eviction filing fee. The agency allows residents to pay the fee over three months.

Residents’ monthly statements include numbers to call for rent assistance and information about talking to property managers about hardships, said Mary McGovern, a tenant at the Elliot Twins apartments and president of the Minneapolis High Rise Representative Council, which advocates for the 5,000-plus tenants living in the housing authority’s high-rise apartments.

“It’s not like 1, 2, 3 and you’re out the door; they don’t work that way,” McGovern said.

She said tenants “would be lost” without the social workers from Volunteers of America who help residents with family problems, money issues, food assistance, clothing and paying their utilities.

“A lot of people struggle to afford housing and they manage to pay the rent, but we’re talking about incomes that are so low … you have to wonder whether they can even afford that rent,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president of research for the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Looking for solutions

The housing authority’s Scott said the agency formed an internal task force on eviction preventions to find solutions. The agency realized that tenants receiving benefits checks were not always getting them at the beginning or end of the month, often causing them to be late on rent.

In addition, the agency worked with the Hennepin County emergency-assistance fund so that tenants could apply for help using their initial notice of late rent instead of having to wait for an eviction notice for their application.

The housing authority also conducted a survey this spring of 150 residents. It found that 75% said they had a late rent payment, with the top reasons including the due date, medical problems, family problems, lack of income and that they forgot. The survey also found that less than half of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they “know where to get help with rent.”

“I think we’re getting better at working through the needs of residents, working with policy issues, working with partners at the county to facilitate residents keeping their housing,” Scott said. “We’re on that path and we’ll continue to refine it as best as we can.”"
The administration said it was moving these agencies for efficiency. Now the truth comes out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'August At Pm']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-administration-said-it-was-moving-these-agencies-for-efficiency-now-the-truth-comes-out/2019/08/10/854ccd10-b91a-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html,"“WHAT A wonderful way to streamline government,” said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at a gala last week, referring to the Agriculture Department’s plan to move two of its science agencies out of the D.C. area to the Kansas City region. In celebrating this controversial decision, Mr. Mulvaney laid bare the thinly veiled motivations behind uprooting researchers: not efficiency, but to drive talented workers out.

Since the relocation announcement in June, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has defended the controversial proposal, arguing that relocation will bring researchers closer to the subjects of their research and save the agency millions in employment costs and rent. But the haste and amateurishness of the process raised suspicions about true motives. And, now, Mr. Mulvaney has confirmed those suspicions by celebrating the gutting of the Economic Research Service, a federal statistics agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees grant money for agricultural research. The motivation fits with the administration’s broader hostility toward experts, science and honest data.

In June, a Politico analysis found that the Trump administration barred dozens of climate-change-related investigations from being publicized. Politico also discovered that the research service issued news releases on only two studies directly related to climate change — both of which were favorable to the meat industry.

Even if relocation were justifiable, the USDA’s handling of the process has, so far, been deplorable. The more than 500 agency employees affected by the move were given 33 days to decide between their career and the lives they had established in the District. Approximately two-thirds chose resignation over reassignment. The loss of talent and institutional knowledge creates an irreparable tear in the fabric of the agency — and an entirely foreseeable one. If the USDA’s plan was to “drain the swamp,” as Mr. Mulvaney put it, then it certainly is succeeding — if by swamp, as Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, they mean civil service expertise. But if the department wants to carry out its true mission of helping rural America, it should rethink this move.

Research by the USDA is vital to farmers. As economic challenges mount with the ongoing trade war with China, and as climate change poses a growing threat to farmlands worldwide, the work by the ERS and NIFA is indispensable. They not only help farmers improve efficiency and productivity but also help smooth access to international markets.

The relocation is not a done deal. The USDA’s watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, published a report this month that challenges the relocation, which is meant to be completed by Sept. 30. By acting without budgetary approval from Congress, the USDA may have violated the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Rather than waiting for a judicial rebuke, the department should cancel the relocation now."
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""
"Gillibrand pledges to direct Justice Department to ""infiltrate"" white supremacist groups",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kirsten-gillibrand-on-face-the-nation-pledges-to-instruct-justice-department-to-infiltrate-white-supremacist-groups/,"In the wake of the anti-immigrant and anti-Latino massacre in El Paso last week, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of seven Democratic senators running for president, vowed to carry out a concerted crackdown on white supremacist groups if elected, saying she would order federal investigators to penetrate racist organizations and thwart potential violent attacks.

""As president I would direct my Department of Justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups,"" Gillibrand said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""To infiltrate them, to make sure we know if they're planning attacks and to actually combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists.""

The New York Democrat said domestic terrorism should be a federal crime and expressed support for a bill spearheaded by her colleague Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois that would bolster the government's efforts to combat domestic terrorist movements.

According to court documents unsealed Friday, the 21-year-old white man suspected of killing 22 people inside a Walmart in El Paso last Saturday admitted to police that he targeted Mexicans. A manifesto he purportedly authored that federal investigators are scrutinizing denounces the growing Latino community in Texas as an ""invasion.""

Like other high-profile Democrats, Gillibrand drew a direct link between President Trump's rhetoric on immigration and the apparent motives of the gunman.

""His words have consequences, and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country,"" she said Sunday.

Asked if singling out the president for his rhetoric in the aftermath of two mass shootings might ratchet up tensions in the country, Gillibrand said Mr. Trump is the one making matters worse.

""He is not leading us in the right direction,"" she said. ""He has used words like 'infestation.' He's used words like 'invasion.' That is creating a climate where people are literally today fueled by anger and hate. They are hunting down other people using weapons of war. That's what we're up against right now."""
"State Department official on leave after civil rights group accuses him of being involved in white nationalist movement, source says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/politics/matthew-gebert-splc/index.html,"(CNN) A State Department official has been placed on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group in a report by a civil rights organization, a source tells CNN.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have been briefed by the State Department on the case of Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer in the department's Bureau of Energy Resources, after he was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch initiative on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. One of the sources said the committee was learning about the facts of the situation and why he had been placed on leave.

In an extensive report released Wednesday, Hatewatch alleged that Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, Gebert used a pseudonym to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,"" Gebert, speaking as ""Coach Finstock,"" reportedly said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. Hatewatch claims it has matched Gebert to the pseudonyms he used online.

The report said that in August 2017, on that same podcast, ""Coach Finstock"" said he was prepared to lose his career for the cause of white nationalism.

USDA tried to cast doubt on UW-linked study about climate effects on nutrients in rice,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/usda-made-behind-the-scenes-effort-to-discredit-uw-assisted-study-looking-at-climate-change-impacts-on-rice/,"U.S. Department of Agriculture officials made a behind-the-scenes effort last year to cast doubt on a study co-authored by two University of Washington researchers about how climate change would affect the nutrients in rice.

The UW scientists were part of an international team that included two federal agricultural scientists. They studied how increased levels of carbon dioxide forecast for the end of the century could diminish the nutritional value of rice, and joined together to co-author a peer-reviewed study accepted by a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In May 2018, weeks before the scheduled publication, findings in the rice study became a source of concern for program leaders of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).

“The narrative isn’t supported by the data in the paper,” wrote Sharon Durham, a department public affairs specialist in a May 7, 2018, email to a Jeff Hodson, communications director for the UW School of Public Health.

Durham noted the USDA had decided not to send out a news release to publicize the study. “Please let me know how you will proceed with your own press release.”

A statement Durham released to Politico and later to The Seattle Times said the concerns had nothing to do with the study’s focus on climate change. They came from career scientists, Durham wrote, adding that no political appointees viewed the draft news release before the decision was made not to send it out.

“The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency,” the statement said.

But a veteran researcher with a lead role in the study thinks the politics of climate change in the Trump administration’s USDA factored into what he views as an attempt to discredit the findings.

“It was a very bizarre set of circumstances. I had been at USDA, altogether for 26 years, and nothing like that had ever occurred to me,” Lewis Ziska said.

The Agricultural Research Service where Ziska worked — and recently resigned from — has a long history of high-quality science that stretches back through decades of Democratic and Republican administrations.

But under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the science linking fossil-fuel pollution to rising global temperatures, Ziska said researchers who focus on sensitive topics such as climate change have become more cautious. Some worry their funding may get cut or they could get reassigned if their work comes to the attention of higher-level officials.

“There is basically a miasma of fear,” Ziska said.

Academic freedom

The USDA 2018 criticism of the rice study, first reported by Politico, did spur a response at the UW, which receives grants from the agency. The interim dean of the School of Public Health at that time was Joel Kaufman. He reviewed the study and reached out to the two UW researchers — Kristie Ebi and Adam Drewnowski.

In a May 15, 2018, email to Vice Provost Mary Lidstrom, Kaufman wrote that the methods and results seem straightforward, and the UW researchers involved in the study “stand behind the scientific content…I’m bringing you into the conversation on the possibility that you would be concerned about the potential risk of irritating the USDA or other potential funders. Do you want or need to be involved in considering this issue?”

“For academic freedom aspects, if the authors are supporting the press release, the university will not interfere,” Lidstrom wrote back.

One week later, the UW sent out its news release.

The multiyear study looked at what happens to a range of rice strains when grown under carbon-dioxide concentrations at end-of-the-century levels, which are forecast to be markedly higher due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The study involved eight researchers from the U.S., Japan, Australia and China. In test plots, some rice was grown with the higher levels of carbon dioxide, while control plots received no additional carbon dioxide.

The UW news release noted the study showed how rice grown at the century’s end is expected to have lower levels of four B vitamins as well as less protein, zinc and iron, and it noted that the impacts will have a disproportionate impact on poor countries where rice is a dietary mainstay.

The study had a much rockier path through the USDA bureaucracy.

Initially, Ziska said, the study appeared to be moving smoothly through an internal department review in the early months of 2018.

The paper also completed an independent peer review organized by editors of Science Advances that involved scrutiny from at least two independent experts, according to a statement from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But in early May, shortly before the scheduled publication, Ziska said, he unexpectedly received a fresh round of questions from within the department’s Agricultural Research Service and he then found that a USDA news release he had helped to prepare about the study had been spiked.

Durham, in a statement to The Seattle Times, said all research service papers follow the same review and clearance process. “This paper was no exception.”

Media interest

Despite the lack of USDA support for the study, promotional efforts by UW and the editors of Science Advances helped stir media interest, with The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets in the U.S. and internationally reporting on the findings.

The USDA did make Ziska available for interviews. But after the splash of publicity for the study faded, Ziska, disillusioned, decided the time had come to leave. Now at Columbia University, he will continue his research on the impacts of a warming world on agriculture.

Ebi, his UW colleague, said Ziska’s departure is a significant loss for the department at a time when it’s important to follow through on research to determine what can be done to counteract the impacts of the declining nutritional values of rice on the global poor who depend on this food.

“We need to understand the breadth and depth of these problems, and what the solutions are,” Ebi said. “It is critically important science, and USDA should be involved.”"
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."

You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-trafficking-leader-praises-ice-trump,"Director and activist Jaco Booyens touted President Trump's historic work in fighting sex trafficking and defended Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as ""incredible people"" who helped keep children safe.

Fox News host Mark Levin asked Booyens whether Trump did more to address the issue than other presidents, including former President Barack Obama. ""No question,"" Booyens responded on ""Life, Liberty, and Levin,"" airing Sunday.

Booyens said that despite all the criticism surrounding ICE, the agency has become a vital partner in combatting sex trafficking.

""These are incredible men and women that help us ... incredible people who actually go and keep America's children safe. This president has empowered them to do so,"" he told Levin.

His movie ""8 Days"" tells the story of a 15-year-old girl who's forced into sex trafficking after attending a party with her friends. Booyens said the film is available on Netflix and other places.

Booyens claimed that he tried taking his story to CNN and MSNBC but faced ""closed doors."" ""I say that not to point finger or blame, that's just a fact. This crime doesn't ask 'are you conservative or liberal?'""

Levin asked Booyens whether CNN and MSNBC were too focused on their own ""ideological agenda"" to cover the issue. ""You want to believe they're too busy to pay attention and yes they are because they're busy with silly stuff -- accusing the president,"" Booyens responded.

He also argued that sex trafficking was rooted in sex addiction fueled by mass media. ""It is sex addiction that in its core is fueled ... it starts with a pornographic culture, soft porn, it's the objectification of women -- which we as a country have done a great job at completely objectifying women."" Specifically, Booyens said, Hollywood was to blame along with the Internet."
DC lawyer's trial to serve as test for Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement work,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Erica Orden']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/greg-craig-trial-justice-department-foreign-lobbying/index.html,"(CNN) One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.

Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president.

Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department's National Security Division and US Attorney's Office in DC.

The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both former Trump campaign leadership, who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media, according to court records.

The trial will also be, in many ways, a defining moment for the Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts.

In March, the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations, in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents.

In making the announcement, the department's national security division head, John Demers, specifically cited a settlement involving Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, over the work at issue in Craig's trial as spurring the department's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, also known as FARA.

The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors, an increase from years prior. The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department's stepped up efforts.

""Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking. If the people don't have the facts, democracy can't work,"" US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington, said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort's sentencing.

Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s.

This year alone, there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller's work: the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia, where Bijan Kian, a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn's, was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian's trial for the conviction to stand.

""Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up,"" said Andrew Herman, a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration. ""Nobody would wish what's happening to Craig on anyone. I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result.""

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement.

While coordinating with Manafort's operation, Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and, through it all, hadn't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians, according to prosecutors. Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA.

Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year.

In some ways, the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department, having bounced between numerous prosecutors' offices before being charged, CNN has reported. After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017, the special counsel's office referred the case to the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which devoted significant resources to the investigation.

But that office, despite its aggressive reputation, declined to bring charges, determining that they didn't have sufficient evidence. In January of this year, the case was transferred yet again, this time to US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia.

But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office, the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired.

Craig was charged at the time with two crimes: making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine. He pleaded not guilty.

But in recent weeks, the Justice Department faced another setback: the judge threw out the charge over making false statements.

If found guilty of the remaining charge, Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep, however. Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April.

Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller's work. He's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial, according to court records, reads like a who's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway.

Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates, jurors will be asked if they've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery, journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times, longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills, lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen, prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux. The list even includes two Kennedy family members: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy; and Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics and nephew of the former President. It's unclear if they would be mentioned or testify, either by presenting evidence or speaking about Craig's character as part of his defense.

Gates is expected to testify as a witness for the prosecution, though what he will say on the stand, especially about his interactions with Manafort, will be limited, prosecutors told the court.

Soon after the Mueller investigation began, defense lawyers in Washington realized how Mueller was spooking lawyers and lobbyists engaged in foreign work, and began pitching their advice on foreign lobbying registration to clients."
Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong 'have gone from irresponsible to dangerous': State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Brunnstrom', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/chinese-reports-on-u-s-diplomat-in-hong-kong-have-gone-from-irresponsible-to-dangerous-state-department-idUSKCN1UZ2HK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement “have gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.

“Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,” Ortagus added in a tweet.

She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: “This must stop.”

On Thursday, Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate’s political section.

“I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children — I don’t think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,” she told a briefing.

The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.

The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.

The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline “Foreign Forces Intervene”.

The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children’s details were disclosed.

In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said “foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”

“China has a long record of broken commitments; it’s their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,” she said.

China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon."
USDA eases relocation timeline as researchers flee agency,https://thehill.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456921-usda-eases-relocation-timeline-as-researchers-flee-agency,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reversed course late Friday, agreeing to key union demands as nearly two-thirds of its research staff will leave the agency rather than move to new headquarters in the Kansas City area.

The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks at the USDA where employees were given a month to decide if they would uproot from D.C. by Sept. 30 or lose their jobs that same day.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) — two of the major research wings within USDA — unionized in the wake of the agency’s relocation plans and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

The Friday contract will allow employees who agreed to relocate to telework through the end of the year, including the option to extend the time period.

Employees who make the move will also be given a bonus equal to one month’s pay “to help compensate for the loss of income incurred by employees moving from the higher wage D.C. area,” according to a press release from the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA employees.

Two-thirds of the staff at the two agencies told USDA they would forfeit their job rather than move to Kansas City in a plan many say is politically motivated and poorly organized.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

Democrats have repeatedly questioned the wisdom of the move.

Those outside of political circles have also questioned the planned relocation and whether it’s entirely legal. A Tuesday report from USDA’s Office of Inspector General said the decision may have violated the law.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.

EPA defies California rules over Monsanto Roundup,https://www.upi.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/08/10/EPA-defies-California-rules-over-Monsanto-Roundup/4571565463730/,"The Environmental Protection Agency told companies Thursday they would not approve labels which abide by California requirements to warn customers that glyphosate in Monsanto Roundup has been linked to cancer. File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License Photo

Aug. 10 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has defied California regulators by no longer approving labels claiming Monsanto Roundup is known to cause cancer.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has listed glyphosate, a chemical compound-base for Monsanto Roundup herbicide weed killer, as causing cancer since July 2017. Furthermore, glyphosate was added to the state's Proposition 65 list, which requires businesses to warn customers about chemicals known to cause cancer.

The EPA defied that regulation Thursday by saying it will no longer approve product labels claiming glyphosate is known to cause cancer.

""It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not post a cancer risk,"" the EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them. EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

The EPA added that California's listing of glyphosate on the state's Proposition 65 list is based on the International Agency on the Research for Cancer classifying it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" However, EPA's independent evaluation found that glyphosate is ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the agency said that its data set was ""more extensive and relevant.""

The EPA action rejects the idea that the weed killer is likely to pose a cancer risk despite rulings against Bayer-owned Monsanto in California earlier this year resulting in tens of millions of dollars in awards to sick clients, and amid the the world's best-selling herbicide facing more than 13,000 suits nationwide.

Among the rulings so far, was a $2 billion award to a couple diagnosed with cancer after using Roundup for decades, which was later cut down to $86.7 million in a subsequent ruling. Another case involved an $80 million award to a California man whose cancer the jury found was likely linked to the herbicide.

California jurors also awarded $289 million to a man last year who testified that two years after he was soaked with the product in an accident as a groundskeeper for a school district near San Francisco, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite wearing protective clothing and face mask."

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining. I don't get hung up on injuries, but what they exactly expect from us triple amputees, single amputees, paras ... I don't, I can't really comprehend that."""
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"
State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
All Eyes on the Aug. 12 USDA Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/all-eyes-aug-12-usda-reports,"The countdown is on. On Monday, Aug. 12, USDA will release its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). This year’s August reports will include more information than ever before, including the resurvey announced in June, satellite data and, for the first time ever, FSA acreage certification information.

This report has the potential to be a market mover and hold several surprises, market analysts say.

“There is no question that the upcoming reports are critical as they should technically set the baseline for production that should have been set six weeks ago, and as such, holds the potential to generate quite a bit of excitement either higher or lower next week,” says Dan Hueber, general manager of The Hueber Report.

Hueber has one big prediction for Monday: “We will experience 30 seconds to a minute of market insanity when the figures are released.”

“Of course, there is a lot of talk about this report,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “A lot of people think the USDA will provide us with more clarity in regard to the production situation for corn and soybeans.”

Vaclavik says USDA should provide some certainty around the acreage situation, based on the extensive resurvey it did in July. But yields remain a huge question market.

“I think will continue to be debated through harvest,” he adds. “In any year, it is difficult to predict yields in August. This year, the crop is very late, and maturity is lagging, along with enormous variability.”

Heading into the report, analysts expect a decline in planted and harvested corn acres and a rise in soybean acres, reports Kevin McNew, chief economist at Farmer's Business Network. That’s based on the Reuters pre-survey poll of analysts.

For corn, the average estimate for planted acres is 88 million acres. That’s 3.1 million acres lower than the July WASDE. Harvested acres are pegged at 80 million acres, which is 3.4 million acres lower than the July estimates.

Corn yields are predicted to be 164.9 bu. per acre, which is down 1.1 bu. from July.

For soybeans, the average estimate for planted acres is 81 million acres, which is up 1 million acres from the July WASDE. Harvested acres are predicted to be 79.9 million acres, which is up around 0.6 million acres form July.

Soybean yields are predicted to be 47.6 bu. per acre, which is down 0.9 bu. from July.

“At FBN, we believe that the range of estimates for corn planted, harvested acres and the yield number was large,” McNew adds. “We believe that given the range of estimates for 2019/20 corn production the August WASDE can contain surprises. For soybeans the range of production related estimates was much narrower suggesting that a general directional consensus on the direction of the 2019/20 crop.”

Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

What you need to know about glyphosate, the cancer-linked chemical found in Cheerios

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."
US DOE Dedicates $1.05M to Blockchain Energy Management Platform,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Kollen Post', 'Yuma Akito']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doe-dedicates-105-mil-to-blockchain-energy-management-platform,"The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded a grant worth $1.05 million to organizations working to commercialize a blockchain-based energy transaction platform.

From energy management to energy exchange

The news comes from an August 9 press release shared by energy company ComEd, one of the grant’s four reported recipient organizations. The others are the University of Denver, Virginia Tech and BEM Controls, a company specializing in energy management software.

The new project is reportedly a continuation of BEM Controls’ existing DOE-funded work on software to enhance energy efficiency in buildings. This latest grant is to expand and promote a new blockchain-based energy marketplace, with ComEd to use its Grid of the Future Lab to demonstrate the new system’s functionality.

The new initiative is expected to be in development for three more years.

Blockchain for a new energy grid

According to Dr. Amin Khodaei, chairman of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Denver:

“The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources calls for advanced management frameworks that support peer-to-peer communications while being fast, scalable and secure [...] Now is the time to develop and demonstrate the technologies that can make a more sustainable and resilient future possible.”

Per the press release, BEM Controls cited security of a broad range of transactions as a primary reason for implementing blockchain in their platforms.

The DOE has shown growing interest in using blockchain in energy grid applications. As previously reported, in January, the department announced $4.8 million in funding for tech research including blockchain for purposes like securing data from fossil power generation sensors.

In April, the DOE announced a partnership with Colorado-based security firm Taekion to deploy blockchain in power-plant security."

""IT, key tenant, can't audit the system, can't look at the logs, you don't know what happened,"" he added. ""Gotta get auditability, I'll say it, gotta have a paper ballot backup.""

Krebs said that he doesn't ""have all the answers"" on election security, adding that ""a lot of these policy suggestions are not my job to answer -- Congress has a role here.""

The cyber head also called for state legislatures to pick up the slack along with federal lawmakers in addressing a lack of much needed funds to update different states' election systems.

Graham: New Bruce Ohr docs show FISA warrant against ex-Trump campaign aide a 'fraud',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/graham-new-bruce-ohr-docs-fisa-warrant,"New documents highlighting top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr's contact with ex-British spy Christopher Steele are the latest troubling development for the DOJ in 2016.

That's the claim from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said Thursday on ""Hannity"" that he believes there was deep corruption in the department during that year's U.S. presidential election.

""Here's what we're looking at: Systematic corruption at the highest level of the Department of Justice and the FBI against President Trump and in favor of Hillary Clinton,"" Graham said.

FBI KEPT USING STEELE DOSSIER FOR FISA APPLICATIONS DESPITE DOCUMENTING EX-SPY'S BIAS, DOCUMENTS SHOW

Host Sean Hannity then asked Graham whether officials ""lied purposefully"" on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

""The best you could say is that they were incompetent,"" Graham responded. ""The most likely outcome is that they wanted a result.""

""I think the insurance policy is what we're seeing here, getting into the Trump campaign,"" Graham continued. ""The FISA warrant against Carter Page was a fraud, I believe. The counter-intelligence investigation is something we have to look at very closely.""

On Thursday evening, newly released records obtained by Fox News showed the FBI formally documented the bias of Steele shortly after the November 2016 presidential election, yet continued to use his unverified dossier in multiple FISA court warrant application renewals.

The documents, first obtained by Judicial Watch, also reveal that top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr maintained contact with Steele for at least six months after Steele was fired by the FBI for unauthorized media contacts in November 2016.

The summaries of FBI interviews with Ohr, known as 302s, show that Ohr knew by September 2016 -- a month before the initial application to surveil the Trump campaign -- that Steele was ""desperate"" that Donald Trump not be elected president.

A source close to the matter told Fox News ""this had the effect of putting a senior DOJ official on notice that a witness/source had an extreme bias"" -- yet the FISA warrant application went through in October 2016 with multiple renewals.

In his interview with Hannity, Graham claimed if a Republican operative acted in a way similar to Steele, the news would receive wall-to-wall media coverage.

""You could not turn on your television,"" he said.

State Department employee linked to white supremacy placed on leave,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-employee-linked-to-white-supremacy-placed-on-leave-report,"A State Department official is reportedly on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The SPLC published a report on Wednesday alleging Bureau of Energy Resources foreign affairs officer Matthew Gebert uses the alias ""Coach Finstock"" to advocate for white supremacy and white nationalism on social media and other places.

The State Department has placed Gebert on leave while it investigates the allegations made in the SPLC report, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.

""[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,"" a man identified as Coach Finstock said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. ""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.""

Gebert held white nationalist parties at his Virginia home, according to the SPLC. The left-wing civil rights group deduced that Gebert operates under the pseudonym ""Coach Finstock"" through a review of the Coach Finstock handle’s history on social media.

The SPLC has made false accusations of bigotry and radicalism in the past. In 2018, the SPLC publicly apologized to Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamic radical the group included in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists."" The SPLC also paid Nawaz a $3.375 million settlement."

Majority of employees report 'hostile work environment' created by St. Pete housing agency CEO,https://www.tampabay.com,"[""Christopher O'Donnell""]",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.tampabay.com/breaking-news/majority-of-employees-report-hostile-work-environment-created-by-st-pete-housing-agency-ceo-20190809/,"ST. PETERSBURG — The St. Petersburg Housing Authority is hiring an outside investigator to look into employee reports of a hostile work environment ""orchestrated"" by agency CEO Tony Love.

The complaints from a majority of staffers at every level emerged during a review of the troubled agency conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Even though the review is ongoing, HUD officials felt it necessary to warn the Housing Authority's governing board that the treatment of staffers is putting the agency at significant legal risk.

""A topic that was consistent from the majority of the staff at every level was 'hostile work environment,' "" Elis Wilson-Henri, HUD public housing regional director for the southeast, wrote in an email to Housing Authority board members.

He has ordered the board to respond with a proposed plan to investigate and deal with the allegations.

Board Chairwoman Stephanie Owens said the housing authority has contracted with law firm Saxon Gilmore to hire an outside investigator. Its senior partner, Ricardo Gilmore, already serves as special counsel to several housing authorities, including Tampa's.

""We’re very concerned,"" Owens said. ""We take those types of allegations very seriously and recognize the importance of taking immediate action and that’s what we’ve done.""

The investigation could be another setback for Love, who has faced criticism after a series of missteps including charging a board member for public records and a Tampa Bay Times investigation that revealed he lived rent-free for nine months in an apartment designated for low-income families.

It also may detract from his recent success in winning coveted tax credits from the state to help refinance the redevelopment of Jordan Park. The credits were awarded last week by the Florida Housing Finance Corp. They can be sold to companies to raise funds for the public housing project's redevelopment.

Housing Authority spokesman Michelle Ligon said neither Love nor the agency would comment until the HUD review is complete.

Complaints about Love's management style, particularly of female employees, has emerged as a problem before.

In 2016, at least two senior staff complained about his treatment of women in anonymous questionnaires they were asked to fill out as part of Love's first evaluation as CEO.

That prompted board members to insist that Love work with Massachusetts housing consultant Leo Dauwer on his people skills, for which Dauwer's firm was paid $3,600.

In a five-hour meeting with the consultant, Love acknowledged he “screamed’’ at staffers and on one occasion made them do non-agency work for him.

But complaints have continued this year. In February, one was filed with human resources by Robin Adams, the authority's asset management officer. She reported needing counseling to deal with the “extreme stress” and anxiety caused by Love, who is paid $157,000 annually to run the agency.

“Mr. Love has consistently verbally abused, harassed and degraded me and other senior staff members, especially female staff members, through one-way interrogations, baseless chastising, insults and bullying,” she wrote. Some six months after the complaint was filed, it was still pending.

HUD decided to conduct a review of the Housing Authority after it used agency funds to sue Mayor Rick Kriseman and the City of St. Petersburg when council members voted to remove three board members for lax oversight. The board members removed from office were staunch allies of Love.

The agency's lawsuit argued that charges of misconduct and neglect of duty cited to justify removal were a ""pretext"" so Kriseman can appoint commissioners who will fire Love.

A judge dismissed the lawsuit, leaving the Housing Authority with at least $27,000 in legal fees.

Wilson-Henri, the HUD official, also told board members in his email that its review has raised some concerns about the Housing Authority's spending. It did not provide any examples.

Still, board members voted at a special meeting earlier this week to lower the threshold for agency spending without prior board approval from $150,000 to $20,000.

""This gives the board closer and more tight checks and balances,"" Owens said.

Trump Criticized DOD’s Potential Cloud Deal With Amazon. Now The Program Is On Hold,https://dailycaller.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/07/trump-amazon-dod/,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is under fire as lawmakers are questioning why Amazon’s cloud technology was unable to detect the Capital One hack.

The company is being scrutinized after President Donald Trump’s criticisms prompted the DOD to put a hold on a program giving Amazon the ability to build out the agency’s cloud technology.

DOD’s decision to place a hold on the $10 billion program also comes as critics of Amazon’s role in the project manage to impress upon Trump how deeply Bezos was involved.

President Donald Trump’s growing skepticism of a potential Department of Defense cloud computing program with Amazon comes as CEO Jeff Bezos fields questions about why his company’s technology was unable to prevent the Capital One hack.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper is now reviewing accusations of unfairness in the contract process for the program, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), the Pentagon announced on Aug. 1. His decision came after Trump ratcheted up criticism of the project. Amazon and Microsoft are the only two finalists.

Amazon, which is expected to land the program, is now wrestling with questions from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, who wants to know why the company’s cloud computing technology was unable to prevent Capital One hack. The company stored the 106 million Capital One credit-card records an accused hacker allegedly stole.

Capital One blamed the incident on “a specific configuration vulnerability” in the way it uses Amazon’s cloud. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday how the accused hacker was allegedly able to exploit a weakness in some misconfigured networks that cloud security experts frequently warn about. Amazon has not replied to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Conservatives and other experts warn that relying on one cloud system creates severe security risks.

“The use of multiple cloud solutions follows industry-wide best practices utilized by most Fortune 500 companies. Mr. [Trey] Hodgkins [of IT Alliance for Public Sector] noted that by using multiple providers, the cybersecurity and functionality of the JEDI system would be improved, costs would decrease through increased competition,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget.

Esper’s review is expected to delay awarding the JEDI contract, which would give the Pentagon a single cloud computing system for data ranging from personnel statistics to intelligence information rather than the hundreds the military currently uses. (RELATED: Trump Says He’s Getting A Lot Of Complaints About DOD’s $10 Billion Cloud Project)

Controversy has plagued the cloud computing program. Computing giant Oracle, for instance, alleged in a May 31 complaint that former DOD official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out JEDI. Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document.

Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle noted in its document, referring to Amazon Web Services, the arm responsible for implementing the system.

Other reports revealed similar problems. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attended a 2017 event with Teresa Carlson, vice president of Amazon’s worldwide public sector services. The dinner ultimately helped forge another meeting in August 2017 between Mattis and Bezos, The Wall Street Journal reported in July, citing emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

White House officials recently showed Trump a document that connects Ubhi and others to a ploy awarding Amazon the 10-year contract, CNN reported in July, citing documents. The document is identical to one from Oracle lobbyist Kenneth Glueck, an executive vice president with the company. The DCNF has independently confirmed the existence of the flow charts.

Trump has gotten more public in his criticisms. “So I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” the president said during a July interview. He was referring to complaints conservative have made recently about a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract. The president also retweeted a Fox News segment on July 22 criticizing the JEDI contract as “The Bezos Bailout.”

White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

How the VA ‘red-flags’ patriots should raise alarms,https://www.bostonherald.com,['Michelle Malkin'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/08/12/how-the-va-red-flags-patriots-should-raise-alarms/,"“Red flag” laws are now all the rage in the Beltway as the magic pill to prevent homicidal maniacs from wreaking havoc on the nation. Even President Trump has endorsed the idea of preemptively confiscating people’s firearms if they are deemed a “threat.”

But if you want to know how this American version of China’s social credit system would work in practice, let me remind you of how Veterans Affairs recklessly red-flags “disruptive” citizens without due process, transparency or accountability in the name of “safety.” Government bureaucrats routinely deprive our nation’s heroes of medical treatment based on arbitrary definitions of who and what constitutes a mental health menace.

Under the VA policy on “patient record flags,” federal bureaucrats can classify vets as “threats” based on assessments of their “difficult,” “annoying” and “noncompliant” behavior. The VA manual says the flags “are used to alert Veterans Health Administration medical staff and employees of patients whose behavior and characteristics may pose a threat either to their safety, the safety of other patients, or compromise the delivery of quality health care.”

What a crock. It’s precisely because so many vets receive inferior care from the feds that they have been forced to raise their voices. Have we all forgotten the 40 veterans who perished at the Phoenix, Ariz., VA, which relegated patients to a bureaucratic black hole through secret waiting lists? Among examples of patients’ behavior referred to the red-flaggers in the VA’s “Disruptive Behavior Committees”: venting “frustration about VA services and/or wait times, threatening lawsuits or to have people fired, and frequent unwarranted visits to the emergency department or telephone calls to facility staff.”

Disabled Air Force veteran and veterans advocate/attorney Benjamin Krause has exposed the Soviet-style targeting of veterans flagged for exercising their First Amendment rights or threatening to sue the VA over neglectful care or for simply being too “expensive.” He calls it “straight out of a totalitarian regime.” In January 2018, a VA Office of Inspector General report found that large numbers of flagged veterans were being left in the dark about being placed on dangerous patient lists — with no recourse to remove phony flags or appeal in any meaningful way.

There are undoubtedly patients in the system who may pose real threats. But the “problem with the process is that it is secret,” Krause explains at DisabledVeterans.org. “The review process is done in secret and the veteran will not know who sat on the committee or what the evidence presented was prior to the decision. Only after the decision is made are veterans informed of the outcome and given a chance to appeal the vague allegations. That seems like a due process violation if I have ever seen one.”

Army vet David Scott Strain of Virginia told me recently that he was a flagged veteran. “My grave sin?” says Strain. “I tried to report the abuse of a deaf, infirm, WWII veteran. He was approximately 95 years of age. A male nurse stood behind his waiting room chair and shouted down at the top of his head, ‘Hello! Hello! Hello! If you can hear me, you can come in now!’ ”

Strain describes how the elderly vet “could not hear this, and the nurse went through three iterations, while giggling and looking at the wait-room personnel as if we were a comedy club audience. It was one of the sickest displays I’ve ever seen.”

For blowing the whistle on VA elder abuse, Strain says, he was banned from all satellite clinics and only granted access to one main facility. VA flaggers can “manufacture tone, the content of what you’re saying, and will even ascribe actions to you that you did not perform,” Strain warns.

“The potential ‘red flag’ laws concern me deeply,” Strain told me. “Why any citizen would think it wise to let the government screw such handles to our backs, to threaten and wag us any which way, is beyond my understanding. However, I fully understand why politicians want it.”

Justice Department moves to potentially decertify immigration judges’ union,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', ""Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team. He Has Previously Worked Covering The Federal Courthouse In Alexandria"", ""Local Law Enforcement In Prince George'S County"", 'Southern Maryland.']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-moves-to-potentially-decertify-immigration-judges-union/2019/08/09/17dc0450-bae4-11e9-a091-6a96e67d9cce_story.html,"The Justice Department moved Friday to potentially decertify the union that represents federal immigration judges, a spokesman said, a maneuver that could silence an organization that has been critical of some aspects of the Trump administration’s overhaul of immigration enforcement.

The department filed a petition asking the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority to examine whether it should revoke the certification of the National Association of Immigration Judges because, a Justice Department spokesman said, its members are “management officials” under the law.

Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the association’s president, said she thinks the petition’s intent is to “disband and destroy the union,” which has publicly pushed for judges to have more independence and sparred with the Justice Department over a quota system it imposed.

“It’s designed to take full control of judges without having a balancing force or a balancing voice,” Tabaddor said.

Immigration judges, who decide deportation and other-immigration related cases, are somewhat unusual in that they are not part of the judicial branch; rather, they are Justice Department employees. Like other Justice Department employees, they are generally prohibited from talking publicly — except that their union can advocate for them.

Tabaddor, for example, was skeptical last year of the administration’s effort to pressure judges to process cases faster by implementing a quota system tied to their performance reviews, saying the directive “could call into question the integrity and impartiality of the court if a judge’s decision is influenced by factors outside the facts of the case.” The union has also advocated for judges to be independent of the attorney general.

Tabaddor disputed that immigration judges could be considered management and thus not eligible to unionize.

“We don’t even have the authority to order the procurement of pencils,” she said.

The Justice Department’s filing will spark the opening of a case, and attorneys with the Federal Labor Relations Authority will probably then conduct an investigation, a Justice Department spokesman said, and the timing of the process varies significantly from case to case."
"State Department confirms alleged leader of white-nationalist group is an employee, won't say if he'll be fired",https://www.insider.com,"['John Haltiwanger', 'David Choi']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.insider.com/state-department-alleged-white-nationalist-employee-2019-8,"A State Department employee led a white-nationalist group in Washington, DC, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center report.

The department confirmed to INSIDER that the man is an employee but would not say whether the allegations affected his status.

""This individual is employed by the Department of State as a foreign affairs officer assigned to the Bureau of Energy Resources in Washington, DC,"" a State Department spokesperson told INSIDER.

The official was placed on leave as of Thursday, according to a Politico report.

A current State Department official served as the leader of a white-nationalist organization in Washington, DC, according to a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) released on Wednesday.

The official, identified as Matthew Gebert, ""hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online,"" the report said.

A State Department spokesperson on Wednesday told INSIDER that Gebert is a foreign-affairs officer assigned to the Bureau of Energy Resources in Washington, DC.

When asked whether the allegations in the SPLC report would affect Gebert's employment status, the department spokesperson told INSIDER, ""The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace.""

Gebert was placed on leave as of Thursday, according to a Politico report.

Gebert joined the department in 2013, according to the SPLC report, during the Obama administration. Based on his position as a foreign-affairs officer, he's a civil servant and not a political appointee.

According to the SPLC report, Gebert operated online under the pseudonym ""Coach Finstock.""

""Through that alias, he expressed a desire to build a country for whites only,"" the report said.

In a white-nationalist podcast in May 2018, which is cited in the SPLC report, Coach Finstock said, ""[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety-split ... That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.""

The report said that under his pseudonym, Gebert helped lead a chapter of an organization led by one of the men who coordinated the deadly white-nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.

The chapter, referred to in the report as ""DC Helicopter Pilots,"" is part of the white supremacist Michael ""Enoch"" Peinovich's organization, The Right Stuff network.

Gebert, in a neo-Nazi podcast, talked about personally attending the Charlottesville march, where he wore a hat and sunglasses to avoid being identified, the SPLC report said. According to the SPLC report, Gebert in a podcast ""expressed no apparent regret about what transpired"" at the rally, where a counterprotester named Heather Heyer was killed after a neo-Nazi plowed a car into her and other people.

The SPLC report comes amid renewed scrutiny over white nationalism. Following the El Paso, Texas, shooting, in which a gunman who espoused white-nationalist sentiment killed at least 22 people, critics have said the White House's rhetoric and policies influenced the rise of hate crimes.

The FBI, which received criticism for its handling of domestic-terrorism concerns after the El Paso shooting, reported that since October, the majority of roughly 100 domestic-terrorism-related arrests involving a racial motive were ""motivated by some version of what you might call 'white supremacist violence.'""

""We take domestic terrorism or hate crime, regardless of ideology, extremely seriously,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a congressional hearing in July. ""We are aggressively pursuing it, using both counterterrorism resources and criminal investigative resources, and partnering closely with our state and local partners.""

The FBI Agents Association on Tuesday urged Congress to declare domestic terrorism a federal crime. ""Acts of violence intended to intimidate civilian populations or to influence or affect government policy should be prosecuted as domestic terrorism regardless of the ideology behind them,"" the group said.

President Donald Trump on Monday condemned white supremacy and said the El Paso shooter was ""consumed by racist hate.""

Two days later, Trump told reporters he was concerned about ""any group of hate ... whether it's white supremacy"" or ""any other kind of supremacy."""
