Trump says appointing Sessions was his biggest mistake,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-appointing-sessions-was-is-biggest-mistake,"President Trump admitted in an interview aired Sunday that he views appointing Jeff Sessions as his attorney general was his “biggest mistake” as president and said if he had a do-over, he would have tapped someone else.

Trump was on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when he made the comment. Sessions resigned last November—just after the midterms—after stark public criticism from the president. It was the height of the Mueller investigation and Trump was openly critical of Sessions decision to recuse himself from the probe in early 2017.

At one point, Trump said, “I don’t have an attorney general. It is very sad,” he said. Trump’s disappointment in Sessions was not limited to the Russia probe. He said he was not happy with “the border” and “numerous” other issues that Sessions’ office affected.

“Every President deserves an Attorney General they have confidence in,” Trump tweeted to Sen. Lindsey Graham. “I believe every President has a right to their Cabinet, these are not lifetime appointments. You serve at the pleasure of the President.”"
How politics explains Trump's U-turns on Iran and immigration,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/politics/iran-immigration-donald-trump-2020-reelection/index.html,"(CNN) The whims and last minute reversals of President Donald Trump 's impulsive leadership style are sending America and the rest of the world on a wild and sometimes dangerous ride.

From Iran to immigration policy and North Korea to trade wars, Trump's tactic of escalating confrontations before backing off from the brink is leaving everyone unsure of where the US government stands.

In key shifts in recent days, Trump has backed off a retaliatory attack abroad on Iran after its forces shot down a US drone and postponed a plan at home to launch coordinated arrests and deportations in 10 cities.

Trump's U-turns come just as he embarks on his 2020 reelection campaign , beset by polls that show him losing to most Democrats. It's that political context that might explain these latest examples of erratic presidential behavior.

Often as crises build, Trump seems caught between competing instincts as he pursues approaches -- even toward national security emergencies -- that seem mostly designed to satisfy his domestic political goals.

On the one hand, Trump relishes the strongman persona around which he built his political brand. He's the man who will chase down undocumented migrants and reverse what he sees as his predecessor President Barack Obama's capitulation to Iran.

Yet over the last week, the President, giving Washington whiplash, has seemed to shy away from the potential political consequences of his planned actions.

This is how the United States came to be just 10 minutes from a conflict with Iran last week , which could have consumed much of the Middle East but for a last minute call by the President that stood down his own administration's military machine.

Such a conflict -- sparked by Iran's downing of a US drone and a planned US retaliatory strike on missile batteries and radar stations -- would have trashed Trump's campaign vow to stop the United States getting pulled into endless foreign wars.

Trump's change of heart on Iran was mirrored earlier in his presidency when he threatened to rain ""fire and fury"" on North Korea -- yet then buddied up to the country's brutal leader Kim Jong Un on the grounds that he wanted to avoid another foreign war.

In this undated photo provided on Sunday, June 23, 2019, by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reads a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump. Independent journalists were not given access to cover the event depicted in this image distributed by the North Korean government. The content of this image is as provided and cannot be independently verified. Korean language watermark on image as provided by source reads: ""KCNA"" which is the abbreviation for Korean Central News Agency.

The President threatens dire consequences to get foes to the table. But though he opened talks with Kim, he's nowhere in persuading him to give up his nuclear weapons. And as a negotiating tactic, Trump's similar approach toward Iran seems even less promising.

US leadership, for decades a force of global stability, is coming to mirror the bullying outbursts, illogical leaps and shock course changes of Trump's own untamed personality. And the President appears to be operating increasingly without the safety nets provided by long-term strategies or a coherent policy process.

Immigration sweep

At home, immigration agents were poised to launch a sweep against migrant families on Sunday— after a directive from Trump last week that surprised his own officials and looked a lot like an effort to fire up his base before his election launch rally.

But the President suddenly countermanded his order for mass deportations in a weekend tweet. CNN's Jake Tapper reported that Trump relented after a phone call with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi

""At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!"" Trump tweeted.

While Trump made his name on harsh immigration rhetoric -- from his first moments as a presidential candidate -- footage of raids in 10 cities might tip the issue into a net negative for him given that many Republicans blame his scorched earth talk for helping to hand the House to Democrats last fall.

Maybe Trump never planned for the arrest and deportation raids to go ahead. Often the President has used such threats to try to win leverage from Democrats in immigration talks --- though he's never been ready when it really matters to compromise, fearing a backlash from his base and the conservative media.

And while he has stepped back on the raids for now, Trump always has the option to crank the immigration rhetoric, as he often does, when the political need arises.

Not ready to lose

The President hinted at one possible explanation for his sudden course corrections in his interview with ""Meet the Press,"" broadcast on Sunday.

""I'm probably not too prepared to lose. I don't like losing. I haven't lost very much in my life,"" Trump said, referring to his 2020 campaign

Democrats hoping to impose that shattering personal defeat on the President will be sure to seize on his unpredictable leadership and an immigration policy that critics regard as inhumane when they gather for their first campaign debates Wednesday and Thursday.

They are particularly likely to drill down on the chaotic national security process that apparently brought the US to the verge of conflict with Iran -- after Tehran shot down a US drone over the Gulf of Oman.

And they will make the case that it is Trump's own hardline policies -- including his decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal with Iran -- that caused the crisis he is now struggling to cool.

Trump's claim that he only found out 10 minutes before he was due to give the final go-ahead for the operation that 150 Iranians could die seems unlikely to be the whole story. It will give an opening to Democrats to argue that he has proven himself unfit to serve as commander in chief.

The President is likely to seek to insert himself into the debates -- probably with a volley of tweet storms. He may have deprived Democrats of one key talking point by suspending the immigration raids -- though candidates are sure to highlight accounts this week of barely believable conditions at detention centers holding undocumented migrant children.

Trump is also taking his anarchic political show on the road this week — to the G20 summit in Japan, that is expected to feature high stakes encounters with the presidents of Russia and China.

Given his impulsive and self-contradictory mood, it's anybody's guess how those could turn out. But he is under intense pressure to extract a win against President Xi Jinping from his trade war with China

The confrontation is another example of how Trump's dueling political priorities often seem to clash -- as they also do in his approach to Iran and immigration.

On the one hand, Trump put standing up to China at the center of his 2016 campaign, accusing the rising Asian giant of ""raping"" the American economy and stealing US jobs.

Yet by waging war with hundreds of millions of dollars in tariffs he has imposed higher prices on US consumers. And China's response -- targeting sensitive political battlegrounds in the Midwest -- is also now threatening to exert a painful price on many of Trump's core voters.

So Trump will again face the choice between escalating his showdown when he meets Xi at the G20 --- or stepping back from the brink to shield himself from further political damage.

A promise kept

Trump's supporters would argue that his wrecking ball presidential demeanor is exactly what they hoped for when he was elected to shake up Washington and the world.

And he has the luxury of a friendly conservative media to ensure that his reversals and unpredictable nature do him no harm with his loyal political base.

Conservative lawmakers and commentators who pounced on Obama and called him weak after he called off military action to enforce his Syria red line in 2013, were quick to praise Trump for doing something similar. They painted his move as a shrewd counterpoint to hawkish members of his administration who want war -- an impression Trump sought to solidify on ""Meet the Press.""

Referring to his national security adviser John Bolton, Trump said: ""He is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he'd take on the whole world at one time.""

The President however portrayed himself as a voice of moderation -- far from the unstable neophyte who Hillary Clinton and other critics said should be kept from the nuclear codes because he could be baited with a tweet.

""You know, a lot of them said, ""We're going to be in World War III the first week."" Didn't work out that way,"" Trump said."
Opinion | Trump’s ‘Concentration Camps’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Charles M. Blow'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/opinion/trump-migrants-camps.html,"I believe that we will one day reflect on this period in American history where migrant children are being separated from their parents, some having been kept in cages, and think to ourselves: How did this happen?

Why were we not in the streets every day demanding an end to this atrocity? How did we just go on with our lives, disgusted but not distracted?

Thousands of migrant children have now been separated from their parents.

As NBC News reported in May:

“At least seven children are known to have died in immigration custody since last year, after almost a decade in which no child reportedly died while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.”

Homeland Security’s own inspector general has described egregious conditions at detention facilities.

And, last week, an attorney for the Trump administration argued before an incredulous panel of judges on the Ninth Circuit that toothbrushes, soap and appropriate sleeping arrangements were not necessary for the government to meet its requirement to keep migrant children in “safe and sanitary” conditions.

As one of the judges asked the attorney:

“Are you arguing seriously that you do not read the agreement as requiring you do something other than what I described: Cold all night long. Lights on all night long. Sleep on the concrete floor and you get an aluminum blanket?”"
Document leak reveals vetting during Trump’s transition to White House,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/23/document-leak-reveals-vetting-during-trumps-transition-to-white-house/,"WASHINGTON — A trove of vetting documents leaked to the news organization Axios on HBO shows “red flags” the administration uncovered as President Trump put together his cabinet and the top levels of government following his shock White House win and his decision to fire transition director Chris Christie.

With Christie’s departure, much of the vetting of candidates was left up to “20-something [Republican National Committee] staffers,” according to Axios’ Jonathan Swan. The documents show what aides worried would be problematic. For instance, both Mick Mulvaney, now the acting White House chief of staff and former Defense Secretary James Mattis got dinged for previous criticism of Trump.

At the top of Mulvaney’s file is the fact that he once called then-candidate Trump “not a very good person.”

National Security Advisor John Bolton’s had allegations in his vetting file that stated that he had a habit of “bullying career State Department” officials and claimed he had been accused of “accosting women on overseas trips.”

Former Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt’s ethical problems were predicted in his file as staffers warned of his “coziness with big energy companies.” Pruitt produced a slew of swamp-ish headlines while at the job, including that he was getting a $50 a night sweetheart deal on a D.C. apartment owned by an energy lobbyist.

In other instances, vetting worked.

With former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani flirting with being Trump’s Secretary of State, staffers compiled an additional 25-page dossier listing his “foreign entanglements.” The documents also warned that Giuliani had only “limited to no international affairs experience.”

Talking to Axios, Giuliani called the document dump “gossip” that was “extremely unfair.”

“The extensive amount of work that I’ve done in the 80 or plus countries that I’ve been to in the last 17 years is what would’ve qualified me to be an excellent Secretary of State,” Giuliani said. “Would you prefer someone who hasn’t been overseas?” Giuliani asked.

Kris Kobach, who was being eyed for Department of Homeland Security head, had “white supremacy” listed as a problem, pointing to accusations coming from previous political opponents that he took contributions from white nationalists.

As for Christie, Axios reporter Swan showed the former New Jersey governor his own file. The biggest concern: would he be able to work in an administration alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, after Christie put Kushner’s father in jail? And among the questions Christie was supposed to be asked: Do you believe your removal from the Trump transition team was orchestrated by Kushner?

“Yes, I do and the reason I do is because that’s what Steve Bannon told me,” Christie said.

Christie was fired two days after Trump’s election and with him went the transition team’s work.

“In the end, this is a monumental staff failure, that failed the president and as a result failed the country,” Christie said after seeing the poor job done on his own vetting file.

White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley called the president’s staff picks an “incredible team” and put down the leaker. “President Trump has done more to improve the lives of the American people in two years than past presidents have done in eight and no disgruntled establishment, D.C. swamp creature’s cowardly leaks can change that,” Gidley told Axios."
Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/agriculture-department-climate-change-1376413,"President Donald Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have both expressed skepticism about climate change and appear to have suppressed research efforts on the topic. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo POLITICO Investigation Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change The Trump administration has stopped promoting government-funded research into how higher temperatures can damage crops and pose health risks.

The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.

The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment — a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice — to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.

Story Continued Below

All of these studies were peer-reviewed by scientists and cleared through the non-partisan Agricultural Research Service, one of the world’s leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.

The administration, researchers said, appears to be trying to limit the circulation of evidence of climate change and avoid press coverage that may raise questions about the administration’s stance on the issue.

“The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves.”

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past and allegedly retaliated against in-house economists whose findings contradicted administration policies, declined to comment. A spokesperson for USDA said there have been no directives within the department that discouraged the dissemination of climate-related science.

“Research continues on these subjects and we promote the research once researchers are ready to announce the findings, after going through the appropriate reviews and clearances,” the spokesperson said in an email.

“USDA has several thousand scientists and over 100,000 employees who work on myriad topics and issues; not every single finding or piece of work solicits a government press release,” the spokesperson added.

However, a POLITICO investigation revealed a persistent pattern in which the Trump administration refused to draw attention to findings that show the potential dangers and consequences of climate change, covering dozens of separate studies. The administration’s moves flout decades of department practice of promoting its research in the spirit of educating farmers and consumers around the world, according to an analysis of USDA communications under previous administrations.

The lack of promotion means research from scores of government scientists receives less public attention. Climate-related studies are still being published without fanfare in scientific journals, but they can be very difficult to find. The USDA doesn’t post all its studies in one place.

Since Trump took office in January 2017, the Agricultural Research Service has issued releases for just two climate-related studies, both of which had findings that were favorable to the politically powerful meat industry. One found that beef production makes a relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and another that removing animal products from the diet for environmental reasons would likely cause widespread nutritional problems. The agency issued a third press release about soy processing that briefly mentioned greenhouse gas emissions, noting that reducing fossil fuel use or emissions was “a personal consideration” for farmers.

By contrast, POLITICO found that in the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency’s research partners.

Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.

The study had undergone intensive review, addressing questions from academic peers and within USDA itself. But after having prepared an announcement of the findings, the department abruptly decided not to publicize the study and urged the University of Washington to hold back its own release on the findings, which two of their researchers had co-authored.

In an email to staffers dated May 7, 2018, an incredulous Jeff Hodson, a UW communications director, advised his colleagues that the USDA communications office was “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science.”

""It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: ‘Don't do a press release,’ "" Hodson recalled in an interview. ""We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people.""

Researchers say the failure to publicize their work damages the credibility of the Agriculture Department and represents an unwarranted political intrusion into science.

“Why the hell is the U.S., which is ostensibly the leader in science research, ignoring this?” said one USDA scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the possibility of retaliation. “It’s not like we’re working on something that’s esoteric … we’re working on something that has dire consequences for the entire planet.”

“You can only postpone reality for so long,” the researcher added.

With a budget of just over $1 billion, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service — known as ARS — is often referred to as “one of the best kept secrets” in the sprawling the department because of its outsize impact on society. The agency has pioneered a variety of major breakthroughs, from figuring out how to mass produce penicillin so it could be widely used during World War II to coming up with creative ways to keep sliced apples from browning, and has for decades been at the forefront of understanding how a changing climate will affect agriculture.

The agency has stringent guidelines to prevent political meddling in research projects themselves. The Trump administration, researchers say, is not directly censoring scientific findings or black-balling research on climate change. Instead, they say, officials are essentially choosing to ignore or downplay findings that don’t line up with the administration’s agenda.

Some scientists see the fact that the administration has targeted another research arm of USDA, the Economic Research Service, as a warning shot. Perdue is moving ERS out of Washington, which some economists see as retribution for issuing reports that countered the administration’s agenda, as POLITICO recently reported.

“There’s a sense that you should watch what you say,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s going to result in some pretty big gaps in practical knowledge. … it will take years to undo the damage.”

Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:



A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.

A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on the waning Ogallala aquifer to the cattle that graze the grasslands.

An April 2018 finding that elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle. The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.

A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.

An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.

A March 2019 finding that increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere. “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.

Those were among at least 45 ARS studies related to climate change since the beginning of the Trump administration that did not receive any promotion, according to POLITICO’s review. The total number of studies that have published on climate-related issues is likely to be larger, because ARS studies appear across a broad range of narrowly focused journals and can be difficult to locate.

Five days after POLITICO presented its findings to the department and asked for a response, ARS issued a press release on wheat genetics that used the term “climate change.” It marked the third time the agency had used the term in a press release touting scientific findings in two and a half years.

While spokespeople say Perdue, the former Georgia governor who has been agriculture secretary since April 2017, has not interfered with ARS or the dissemination of its studies, the secretary has recently suggested that he’s at times been frustrated with USDA research.

“We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers,” he said in April, responding to a question from POLITICO. “That relies on sound, replicable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has been clear about his views on climate science and agricultural research generally: He doesn’t think much of either.

In each of his budgets, Trump has proposed deep cuts to agricultural research, requests that ignore a broad, bipartisan coalition urging more funding for such science as China and other competitors accelerate their spending. Congress has so far kept funding mostly flat.

The president has also repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. After the government released its latest national climate assessment in November, a sweeping document based on science, Trump bluntly told reporters: ""I don't believe it.""

Officials at USDA apparently took the hint and the department did not promote the report, despite the fact that it was drafted in part by its own scientists and included serious warnings about how a changing climate poses a threat to farmers and ranchers across the country.

The USDA’s failure to publicize climate-related research does more than just quell media coverage: It can also prompt universities, fearful of antagonizing a potential source of funding, to reconsider their own plans to publicize studies.

The saga of the rice study last spring shows how a snub from USDA can create spillover effects throughout the academic world.

Emails obtained by POLITICO from one of the study’s co-authors show that ARS communications staff actually wrote a release on the study, but then decided not to send it out. The Agriculture Department and UW in Seattle had initially planned to coordinate their releases, which would both be included in a press packet prepared by the journal Science Advances, which published the study in May.

The journal had anticipated there would be significant media interest in the paper. Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.

Several days before the paper was slated to be published, Hodson, the UW communications official, sent ARS communications staff a draft of the press release the university was planning to send out. ARS officials returned the favor, sending UW their own draft press release. The headline on USDA’s draft was clear: “Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Can Reduce Vitamin Content in Rice,” though the body of the release did not mention the word “climate.”

All seemed to be on track for the rollout. A few days later, however, Hodson got a phone call from an ARS communications staffer. She told him that the agency had decided not to issue a press release after all and suggested UW reconsider its plans, noting that senior leaders at ARS now had serious concerns about the paper, according to the emails.

The staffer explained that officials were “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science,” Hodson wrote in his email to his colleagues shortly after the call.

Having the Agriculture Department question the data just days before its publication struck many of the co-authors as inappropriate. The paper had already gone through a technical and policy review within ARS, both of which are standard procedure, and it had gone through a stringent peer-review process.

Kristie Ebi, one of the co-authors from UW, replied to Hodson: “Interesting — USDA is really trying to keep the press release from coming out.”

Nonetheless, senior leaders at UW took USDA’s concerns about the paper seriously, Hodson said. (It also wasn’t lost on anyone, he said, that other parts of the university receive substantial grant funding from the Agriculture Department.) The university conducted an internal review and determined that the science was sound. It went ahead with its press release.

The USDA’s attempt to quash the release had ripple effects as far as Nebraska. After catching wind of USDA’s call to the University of Washington, Bryan College of Health Sciences, in Lincoln, Neb., delayed and ultimately shortened its own release to avoid potentially offending the Agriculture Department.

“I’m disappointed,” said Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist at Bryan who co-authored the rice paper. “I do not even work at the USDA, but a potential call from the government agency was enough of a threat for my school to skip participating in the press-package arranged by the journal. Instead, our college issued a local and abbreviated release.""

A spokesperson for Bryan College said that the institution supports Loladze’s work and noted that the college ultimately issued its own press release and covered the study in its own publications.

“There was no omission or intentional delay based on what others were saying or doing,” the spokesperson said.

Despite the efforts of the Agriculture Department, the rice paper attracted substantial international press coverage, largely because many of the outside institutions that collaborated on the study, including the University of Tokyo, promoted it.

Kazuhiko Kobayashi, an agricultural scientist at the University of Tokyo and co-author on the paper, said he couldn’t understand why the U.S. government wouldn’t publicize such findings.

“It’s not necessarily bad for USDA,” he said in an interview. “Actually, it’s kind of neutral.”

“In Japan we have an expression: sontaku,” he said, offering his own speculation about the political dynamic in the United States. “It means that you don’t want to stimulate your boss … you feel you cannot predict your boss’s reaction.”

A USDA spokesperson said the decision to spike the press release on the rice study was driven by a scientific disagreement, not by the fact that it was climate-related.

“The concern was about nutritional claims, not anything relating to climate change or C02 levels,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency. They felt that the data do not support this.”

The spokesperson said no political appointees were involved in the decision.

Authors of the rice study strongly disagreed with the concerns USDA raised about their paper. In an email leading up to publication, Loladze, the Bryan College researcher, accused the department of essentially “cherry picking” data to raise issues that weren’t scientifically valid, according to the emails.

When the Agriculture Department chooses to promote a study, the impact can be significant, particularly for the agriculture-focused news outlets that are widely read by farmers and ranchers.

Earlier this year, when the agency decided to issue its release about the study finding that producing beef — often criticized for having an outsize carbon and water footprint — actually makes up a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural trade press cranked out several stories, much to the delight of the beef industry. The study had also been supported by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

The USDA’s efforts to hide climate work aren’t limited to ARS. A review of department press releases, blog posts and social media shows a clear pattern of avoiding the topic. These platforms largely eschew the term “climate change” and also steer clear of climate-related terms. Even the word “climate” itself appears to have now fallen out of favor, along with phrases like carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation and sequestration.

In April, for example, USDA sent out a press release noting that USDA officials had signed on to a communique on the sidelines of a G-20 agricultural scientists' meeting that reaffirmed their commitment to “science-based decision making.” The release made no mention of the fact that most of the principles USDA had agreed to were actually related to “climate-smart” agriculture.

Scott Hutchins, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, told POLITICO at the time that he emphasized science-based decision-making in the release — not climate — because that was the strength the participants brought to these international dialogues. He added that there was “no intent whatsoever” to avoid including the words “climate smart” in the release.

A spokesperson for USDA said that department leadership “has not discouraged ARS or any USDA agency from using terms such as climate change, climate, or carbon sequestration, or from highlighting work on these topics.”

But David Festa, senior vice president of ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, which works with farmers and ranchers on climate mitigation, said tensions within the USDA over climate issues are preventing a more robust discussion of the effects of climate change on American agriculture.

“USDA really could and should be leading… and they’re not,” Festa said.

Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer whose operation is roughly half conventional, half organic grain, said farmers are simply not getting much information from USDA related to how to adapt to or mitigate climate change.

“My farmers tell me this is frustrating,” said Lehman, who serves as Iowa Farmers Union President.

The gap in the conversation is particularly pronounced right now, he said, as an unprecedented percentage of growers across the Midwest have had difficulty planting their crops because fields are either too wet or flooded -- an extreme weather scenario that’s been disastrous for agriculture this year.

“Farmers have a sense that the volatility is getting worse,” he said.

“You get the sense that it’s very sensitive,” Lehman said of the current dynamic around climate science at USDA. “But if you can’t have an open conversation about it, if you feel like you’re being shunned, how are we going to make progress?”

Even during the George W. Bush administration, when climate change was first deemed a “sensitive” topic within ARS — a designation that means science and other documents related to it require an extra layer of managerial clearance — the department still routinely highlighted climate-related research for the public.

In the first three years of Bush’s second term, for example, USDA promoted research on how farmers can change their tilling practices to reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere, a look at how various farm practices help capture carbon into soil, and a forecast on how rising CO2 levels would likely affect key crops. The communications office highlighted work showing that using switchgrass as a biofuel in lieu of ethanol could store more carbon in soil, which would not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also boost soil health. There was also a release on a study simulating how climate change would pose challenges to groundwater.

Under Bush, the department publicly launched a five-year project on “Climate Friendly Farming” and touted a sweeping initiative aimed at better understanding and reducing agriculture’s greenhouse emissions.

“Even a small increase in the amount of carbon stored per acre of farmland would have a large effect on offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,” an ARS release noted in 2005.

Jim Connaughton, who served as chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy during the Bush administration, said he was encouraged that USDA and other agencies have so far been able to continue conducting climate science even as the issue has become more politically sensitive within the current administration. However, he noted it was “really unusual” for research agencies to systematically hold back scientific communication.

During the Bush era, he said, “The agencies were unfettered in their own decisions about publicizing their own science.”

“The tone from the top matters,” he added. “The political appointees are taking signals about their own communication products.”

During the Obama years, USDA became increasingly outspoken about climate change and the need to involve agriculture, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.

The department came up with sweeping action plans on climate change and climate science and highlighted its work on a number of different platforms, including press releases, blog posts and social media blasts. In 2014, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also launched Climate Hubs in 10 regions across the country aimed at helping farmers and ranchers cope with an increasingly unpredictable climate.

“We were trying to take science and make it real and actionable for farmers,” said Robert Bonnie, who served as undersecretary for natural resources and the environment at USDA during the Obama administration. “If you’re taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place.”"
Officials accuse DHS chief Kevin McAleenan of leaking ICE raids plan to sabotage operation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/officials-accuse-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-of-leaking-ice-raids-plan-to-sabotage-operation,"This week's big leak about a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was orchestrated by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an effort to sabotage the raids before they were scheduled to take place, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

In a move he said was to placate Democrats, President Trump announced on Saturday that the nationwide immigration enforcement operation planned to start Sunday — aimed at migrant families who illegally remain in the country despite being denied asylum — was called off to give lawmakers two weeks to work on a plan to fix legal “loopholes” he said have enticed migrants to come to the U.S.

However, all five officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner confirmed McAleenan's decision to go rogue and stymie the operation was what prompted the White House to call off the 10-city operation.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post on Friday.

The sources said only a small number of people in the White House, ICE, and DHS were even aware of the plan’s details, including which cities, the date and time, and who would be targeted.

Two officials said the acting secretary, who was promoted internally in April, had fought for months during closed-door discussions with White House officials, the former acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, and the new acting ICE Director Mark Morgan against the plan, which they noted was similar to one the Obama administration carried out in 2015.

“I know he has not approved of this operation for months,” one person familiar with those private conversations said during a phone call Saturday night. “The president wouldn’t leak that. ICE wouldn’t leak that. There’s only a few people involved in these discussions … The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.”

“That’s our belief,” a second official said when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The first official said McAleenan may have leaked it so that he could “be the martyr” in the face of anticipated blowback in the future.

A third official claimed McAleenan “cares more about what liberals and 'Never Trumpers' in Congress and the media think of him the achieving the express mission of his department.”

“[T]his will leave an un-erasable mark on his tenure,” the third official wrote in a text message Saturday evening.

Leaking the information would only have “benefitted one person” who had knowledge of the plan, according to the first person, who added there was “no doubt in my mind” McAleenan either told the Post himself or had a close comrade at DHS take care of it.

“His hands were dirty,” that same official said.

McAleenan traveled with the author of the Post report, Nick Miroff, on a government plane down to the border on Wednesday.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Following the Post report Friday, ICE advised the White House not to go forward with the raids, in part because those who were the targets might have fled the locations Enforcement and Removal Operations officers had expected to find them.

“Leaking the locations and details to stop the operation from happening not only harmed operational integrity, but it put the safety and well-being of his own officers in jeopardy,” the third official wrote.

“That’s law enforcement sensitive information. You just don’t reveal that,” the second official said. “It gets people hyped up. It gets the NGOs activated, and then anyone wearing a jacket with the ICE name on it is really chastised. Cities are coming out saying, ‘Here’s how you can protect yourself against it.’”

That same official said the “worst” consequence of the leak, especially if it was directed by the department’s leader, was how it endangered personnel.

“It really jeopardized the safety of law enforcement officers — that’s the part that’s really detrimental,” the official said."
The Cuyahoga River caught fire 50 years ago today. These stomach-churning photos highlight why the EPA exists.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-photos-of-cuyahoga-river-on-fire-before-epa-2019-6,"Fifty years ago today, on June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga river in Cleveland, Ohio caught fire.

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

Take a look at what the Cuyahoga River — and other waters around the US — looked like before the EPA existed."
Former top military adviser concerned president is 'running out of options' with Iran,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/thing-now-war-iran-joint-chiefs-chairman/story?id=63887304,"The former top military adviser to both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama said on Sunday that he's concerned escalating tensions with Iran ""could spin out of control,"" stressing that the last thing the world needs is the United States going to war with the Middle Eastern country.

Interested in Iran? Add Iran as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Iran news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

""My biggest concern is the president is running out of room, running out of options, and while the rhetoric goes back and forth on how close we came to hitting Iran just the other day, that this thing could spin out of control,"" retired Adm. Mike Mullen told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz. ""The last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran.""

Mullen, who boasts a lengthy military career and served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff between October 2007 and September 2011, said politicians need to diplomatically attain their goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and that Americans need to call their representatives to advocate against declaring war on Iran.

""I really would like to know that the American people who feel we should not go to war with Iran are pressing their congressmen, their senators and everybody in the public domain to make sure that no matter what happens with respect to where we are with Iran right now, that we do not go to war,"" he said on ""This Week."" I think the politicians need to figure out a way to achieve the objective, which is Iran without a nuclear weapon, without -- from my perspective -- without regime change, without going to war.""

Noam Galai/Getty Images, FILE

One of those politicians, House Armed Services Ranking Member Mac Thornberry told Raddatz that President Donald Trump ""is clearly trying to navigate a fine line to show that you cannot attack Americans and American military equipment without having a response.""

""He's very conscious of not getting on an escalatory ladder that leads to a military conflict that neither side wants,"" the Texas Republican said in an interview on ""This Week.""

However, 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the president of ""taking a belligerent course of escalation and provocation with Iran"" since the beginning of his presidency.

""We pulled out of a anti-nuclear deal that gave us complete transparency into their nuclear program,"" Booker said on ""This Week,"" referring to Trump's decision in May 2018 to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, colloquially referred to as the Iran nuclear deal. ""We literally isolated ourselves from our allies and set us out on a very fragile limb towards conflict.""

""The critical crisis we have is not just a drone being shot down, but now Iran has moved back to where it was before, which could be months from getting a nuclear weapon, which puts us again in that region on the brink of chaos,"" he added, also accusing the president of not having a strategy and making the U.S. ""weaker.""

In a series of tweets on Friday, Trump said that he called off a military strike on Iran with just 10 minutes to spare on Thursday night, explaining that the civilian casualties that would have occurred would not have been a ""proportionate"" response to the Iranians shooting down an unmanned U.S. drone late Wednesday.

Iran claimed the drone was flying in its airspace, but the U.S. government disputed that, saying it was flying in international airspace. Trump's reversal on the strike, which was first reported by The New York Times, was against the advice of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, sources told ABC News.

Mullen told Raddatz that a it's ""very, very unusual,"" but not unprecedented ""that a strike would be called off so close to its execution.""

However, leaving for Camp David on Saturday, Trump told reporters ""we hadn’t made a decision to go forward"" with striking Iran when the retaliatory response was called off, later tweeting, ""I never called the strike against Iran 'BACK,' as people are incorrectly reporting.""

I never called the strike against Iran “BACK,” as people are incorrectly reporting, I just stopped it from going forward at this time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2019

The president reiterated to reporters that his reason for stopping the strike was because he didn't want to kill 150 Iranians ""unless it's absolutely necessary.""

The United States did respond with a cyber strike against the country, The Washington Post reported on Saturday and a source later confirmed to ABC News. Trump approved an offensive cyber strike against Iranian computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches. The cyber attack was launched Thursday and was in the works for weeks if not months.

Thornberry told Raddatz on ""This Week"" that when Trump met with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders Thursday, himself included, ""everyone agreed that shooting down an unarmed American aircraft deserved a response,"" and that all agreed ""it should be on the lower end of the range of possibilities.""

However, he added, ""This story is not over,"" saying the Iranian's response to the cyber strike matters.

""Obviously the president has a whole range of additional responses that he could employ,"" Thornberry said. ""There are a number of other military and probably other actions that could be taken if the Iranians decide that they want to continue this aggressive provocative sort of behavior.""

The top Republican on the Armed Services Committee credited the president for seeking bipartisan input on how the United States should respond, but Booker was critical of the fact that a military response was considered at all, saying on ""This Week"" that Trump can't take military action against Iran without congressional approval.

""The Constitution speaks very clearly on this that he needs to come to Congress before he engages in military action that again could have us tumbling towards chaos and war in that region,"" he said.

""This situation is getting more and more tense, not less. We have a president that seems to be doing this like a reality TV show when trying to build more drama and trying to make a foreign policy by tweet,"" Booker added. ""We have to, as a nation, work in coordination with our allies to denuclearize Iran, and to bring stability and peace back to that region.""

Mullen said that if Iran does begin enriching uranium again and looks to be on its way to developing a nuclear weapon, it may lead to Israel attacking the country.

The former Joint Chiefs chairman also warned, ""Iran with a nuclear weapon would start to proliferate nuclear weapons in the Middle East, which is incredibly dangerous. Other countries would then probably generate that kind of capability. And the Middle East has got a lot of problems and we don't need more nukes.""

Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

Booker echoed that warning, saying, ""We're closer to a nuclear weapon, which could trigger proliferation around the region. It could trigger a military conflict and have us tumbling back into a Middle East war that will cost American lives and trillions of American dollars.""

Thornberry said on ""This Week"" that Trump is ""giving the Iranians every opportunity to back out of this cycle of increasing violence.""

He said Trump shouldn't be criticized for giving the country the opportunity, but added that there's a limit to that.

""If Iran goes back to mining tankers, the sorts of things they've been doing here lately, then we have a whole range of military and other responses which we can employ, and I think the president will look to do that,"" he said.

But Mullen cautioned that if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, ""attacking militarily is a very, very difficult task to actually make it happen."""

Another person rescued from rain-swollen Cuyahoga in Kent,https://www.ohio.com,['Staff Reports'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.ohio.com/news/20190622/another-person-rescued-from-rain-swollen-cuyahoga-in-kent,"KENT — First responders pulled one person out of the fast-moving Cuyahoga River in downtown Kent Saturday morning, and again asked people to stop using the rain-swollen waterway.

Police and firefighters needed two rescue boats to eventually reach one woman clinging from a downed tree branch, a witness reported. The woman, who had been kayaking, was in the water at least 30 minutes. The first rescue boat got stuck by a downed tree and had to be rescued itself after a second boat reached the woman about 11:10 a.m.

Kent Fire Department Lt. Patrick Edwards said the woman was one of two people in the water; the other person, also a female, was able to get to shore without assistance from rescue crews, according to Edwards. He added that the woman who was rescued was treated by paramedics and released at the scene. The woman who “self-rescued” did not need any treatment, said Edwards.

Edwards said a passerby saw the women in the water just past the West Main Bridge and called 911 at about 10 a.m. According to an account he received from the women, Edwards said one woman fell out of her kayak and grabbed on to a fallen tree branch. The second woman attempted to help the first woman, but also fell out of her kayak, said Edwards, who added that the second woman was able to swim to shore on her own.

“At this time we are requesting people to stay off the river due to high water & swift currents,” Kent police tweeted a short time later. “Until the water recedes we are requesting that you stay off the Cuyahoga River at this time.”

A group of kayakers was rescued from the Cuyahoga River in Kent Wednesday, and all made it to shore safely with the help of the Portage County Water Rescue Team.

That was the second such rescue this month, and prompted warnings from Kent Fire Chief John Tosko about water safety with the river levels so high.

On its Facebook page, the Kent Police Department reported that “12 people have been rescued from the river” during the last couple of days. The department praised the work of its officers, city firefighters, the Portage County Water Rescue Team and dispatchers “for their excellent work and professionalism over the last couple of days.”

Kent police noted that people are putting their lives at risk when they enter the river in its current condition and they are also putting first responders’ lives in “grave danger.”

The Kent Fire Department also urged people to stay out of the river.

“The river conditions are extremely dangerous, with many strainers present,” the fire department stated on its Facebook page.

“These conditions are beyond recreational skill levels and place our rescuers in grave danger.”

The Portage County Water Rescue Team noted on its Facebook page that the river “is NOT suitable for recreational boating as of right now.”

VA employees say agency is actively retaliating against whistleblowers,https://thehill.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449882-va-employees-say-agency-is-actively-retaliating-against-whistleblowers,"Three employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs said in new interviews that they were sidelined at their jobs and stripped of responsibilities after they raised alarms about improper treatment of patients.

In interviews with USA Today the three staffers, physician Katherine Mitchell, CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, and physiologist Minu Aghveli said that they were removed from patient care positions to prevent them from learning of future or ongoing abuses at the agency.

The three are set to testify before Congress on a wide range of patient mistreatment this week.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" Mitchell told USA Today. ""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans. If people can’t identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. That’s what it boils down to.""

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someone’s health or safety is being threatened,"" she added in the interview.

Dettbarn, who said he hoped to return to patient care, added that a culture of fear at the agency had led to few staffers advocating on behalf of patients.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he told the newspaper. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Sidelining those who speak out, she added, ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

A spokesman for the agency declined to comment to USA Today on the assertions from Mitchell and the others. In a statement to The Hill, an agency spokesperson stressed that the agency was working on implementing new improvements to protect whistleblowers.

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" the spokesperson said.

""VA does not tolerate retaliation against employees who have made a protected disclosure,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Any employee who feels they have been retaliated against for making a protected disclosure is encouraged to contact VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).""

Trump's tax returns — DOJ trying to put off the inevitable?,https://thehill.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/449848-trumps-tax-returns-doj-trying-to-put-off-the-inevitable,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) finally submitted its brief explaining why the secretary of the Treasury and IRS commissioner are not complying with a Congressional subpoena issued to them from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Nea for Donald Trump’s personal tax returns as well as business-related tax returns and return information from the IRS.

Essentially, the DOJ explained that it viewed the Congressional subpoena to be a pretext to obtain and then publicly disclose the President’s tax returns when he had made it clear that it was not his intention to do so.

The DOJ acknowledged that a plain-language reading of Section 6103(f) of the Internal Revenue Code required compliance and an obligation on the part of the IRS to turn over the requested tax returns — but then the DOJ divined and opined that Chairman Neal’s request had no legislative justification and was a pretextual means to a public disclosure end result that was ultimately motivated by politics.

IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig — a Trump appointee — declined to comply with a written request by Chairman Neal for Trump’s tax returns, passing the buck to his boss, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinTrump's tax returns — DOJ trying to put off the inevitable? GOP lawmakers want Mulvaney sidelined in budget talks The Hill's Morning Report — US strikes approved against Iran pulled back MORE. Mnuchin also demurred compliance with the Congressional subpoena, explaining that his rejection of the subpoena was upon the advice of the DOJ, whose above referenced written opinion would be forthcoming.

The DOJ opinion asserted that the executive function of government, which the IRS and Treasury Department fall under, has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of tax returns and would not accept the authority of a written request under Section 6103(f) from Congress unless there was an acceptable legislative intent behind the tax return request.

It is here that the rubber meets the road, and it is here that the courts will make their analysis and ultimately their decision.

In anticipation of the coming legal battle over disclosure of Trump’s tax returns, the IRS Office of Chief Counsel drafted a legal opinion titled “Congressional Access to Returns and Return Information.”

IRS Counsel deals with requests for tax returns from authorized agencies every day in each of its offices around the country. There is no more experienced legal authority when it comes to discerning the nuances of IRS disclosure authority than IRS Counsel. It also should be noted that the draft disclosure opinion by IRS Counsel was formulated prior to the placement of current IRS Chief Counsel Michael Desmond, who took office in February 2019.

So President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Joint Chiefs chairman: 'The last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran' Pence: 'We're not convinced' downing of drone was 'authorized at the highest levels' Trump: Bolton would take on the whole world at one time MORE had in place both his hand-picked IRS commissioner, Rettig, as well as Chief Counsel Desmond to advise the Treasury secretary and past Trump business partner, Mnuchin, as to the best legal course to take with regard to the tax return disclosure issue. Yet Mnuchin chose to punt and to rely upon the DOJ for legal advice and ignore that of the best legal experts in the field on the matter.

We can only speculate that the DOJ was brought into this matter in conjunction with the current White House's stonewalling of all written requests and subpoenas from congressional oversight committees. Whatever the reason for the DOJ's entry into the tax disclosure matter, it would appear that the president is being ill served. It is highly likely that an appellate opinion will come down that will mirror that of the draft IRS Counsel opinion in this matter.

A couple of quotes from the IRS draft opinion are dispositive:

“In general, the statutes provide that the Secretary (Treasury) shall furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory , requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.”

furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.” “Subsection (f)(1) and (2) do not require the Ways and Means and Finance Chair or JCT Chief of Staff to include a reason or purpose for the request. Therefore the Secretary’s obligation to disclose return and return information would not be affected by the failure of a tax-writing committee or the JCT to state a reason for the request.”

It should be noted that Chairman's Neal request did, in fact, include a reference to a need for the House Ways and Means committee to review Presidential audits: ""The Committee is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our Federal tax laws including but not limited to, the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.""

In a nutshell, what we have here is the Treasury secretary ignoring the advice of his most experienced legal minds with regard to IRS disclosure law and punting the issue to the DOJ and hoping that the creation — some would call a concoction — of an alternate legal issue over the plain-language reading of the IRS disclosure statute will ignite a constitutional issue worthy of a favorable appellate ruling.

Absent that, the only real accomplishment is kicking the can down the political road.

Justice delayed is justice denied.

Opinion: Ignore the protests from bureaucrats. More federal agencies would be smart to move their operations away from Washington.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue wants to move a few D.C. employees closer to the farmers they regulate. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)

It was a dramatic scene. As Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue spoke to his employees at an all-hands meeting in D.C. last week, several of them stood up and turned their backs to Perdue in silent protest.

I’ve never seen a similar protest at a private company’s staff meeting, although a few of my co-workers were known to silently nod off. Since I had grown accustomed to regular paychecks, I feigned rapt attention while elbowing my sleepy comrades.

What hideous scandal provoked so many loyal public servants to publicly oppose their boss and disrupt America’s beloved agricultural bureaucracy? The $22 trillion national debt? Creeping fascism? The inclusion of kale in Caesar salads?

No, agriculture workers were mad that the secretary is moving a few of them nearer the agriculture they’re regulating.

Work with those you regulate? Eww

“Following a rigorous site selection process, the Kansas City Region provides a win win – maximizing our mission function by putting taxpayer savings into programmatic outputs and providing affordability, easy commutes, and extraordinary living for our employees,” Secretary Perdue said in a press release.

“The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C.”

Don’t get too excited about the money saved, taxpayers. Perdue is only moving 547 employees out of nearly 100,000 employed by the USDA, or about half of 1%.

Still, this minor relocation, utterly common among the private sector, provoked protest and internal demands to unionize the two small sub-agencies affected.

Just imagine, agricultural regulators might be forced to associate with farmers. Eww.

Most agencies should move out of D.C.

This is a tiny step in the right direction, but most of our federal agencies should be moved out of the Beltway. Leave the departments of State, Defense and Treasury in Washington; those are the only three outlined in the Constitution to begin with. If we aren’t going to consolidate or eliminate the other agencies, at least move them closer to their mission.

The Department of the Interior should be, well, in the interior. As an Arizonan, I’m biased, but relocate it to the Grand Canyon State. After all, the federal government already owns nearly 39% of our state. Gila Bend is nice this time of year.

Shouldn’t Housing and Urban Development focus on a city that needs some help? Downtown Detroit is a perfect fit.

The U.S. News and World Report lists Alabama as the worst state for education. Why doesn’t Betsy DeVos move her thousands of employees to Birmingham? Perhaps they could expand their impact by volunteering for a few hours to tutor in local schools.

Maybe they'd serve people better

Six of America’s wealthiest counties surround Washington, D.C. Not only would these moves save taxpayers millions, but they would alleviate income inequality by spreading the government’s borrowed wealth. Why should the perpetual economic boom be limited to our capital?

Better yet, it would help bureaucrats to better serve and understand those whom they are supposedly helping.

If the cabinet secretaries need to commute every few weeks to the White House or Capitol Hill, that’s easy enough to accommodate. Or they could avoid the hassle by video conferencing like the rest of us.

Relocate the Department of Labor to the Rust Belt, the Department of Energy to the oil fields of North Dakota, and the Department of Transportation to the intersection of Interstates 80 and 25 in Cheyenne, Wyo.

And if the president ever needs an energetic Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I’m willing to relocate to any of our fine military bases in Hawaii. I’m not about to turn my back on that move.

"Huawei reportedly sued US Commerce Department over seized equipment, ramping up trade war tensions",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Mark Matousek'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-sues-us-department-of-commerce-over-seized-equipment-2019-6,"The Chinese tech company Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Commerce on Friday alleging that it has ""unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency action"" on unspecified telecommunications equipment that it seized in 2017, Bloomberg reported.

In the lawsuit, Huawei reportedly said that it had sent the equipment to be tested in a California lab in July 2017. the tech giant said the equipment was taken by the US government as it was being returned to China due to uncertainty over whether the equipment required an export license, according to Bloomberg.

Huawei reportedly argued that the equipment didn't need an export license and that it had given the US all of the information it asked for. The company said in the lawsuit that the US has not yet come to a decision on whether the equipment can be returned to China, according to Bloomberg.

Huawei and the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.

The lawsuit adds another layer to the increasing tension between Huawei and the US government.

In December, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on charges of violating US trade sanctions against Iran.

The arrest came months before Commerce Department effectively banned American companies from working with Huawei, saying the company's operations posed a threat to US national security and foreign policy, though comments from President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have suggested the ban is related to the trade war between the US and China.

The tension seems to be taking its toll on the tech giant, as Huawei has since delayed product releases and cut revenue expectations for this year."
Internal DHS and ICE immigration detention practices are broken,https://thehill.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/449937-internal-dhs-and-ice-immigration-detention-practices-are-broken,"This month’s damning report from the agency’s own inspector general, which rebuked ICE’s detention practices, including placing immigrants in solitary confinement, is an accountability decoy. In fact, the report only scratches the surface of their unlawful actions.

Our organization, Government Accountability Project, represents numerous whistleblowers within the DHS who have made multiple disclosures to the agency’s inspector general.

These whistleblowers saw egregious violations of laws, rules and regulations in practices that substantially threaten immigrants’ health and safety and reported those wrongdoings inside the system — to the people with the authority to investigate and address misconduct.

ADVERTISEMENT

One whistleblower we represent, Ellen Gallagher, was a senior policy analyst at the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL). After reading dozens of ICE segregation reports, she discovered that ICE regularly used solitary confinement practices against mentally ill and medically vulnerable detainees in violation of federal detention standards.

The abuses she discovered were graphic — detainees were denied proper medical care and attention; others were stripped bare and placed in “suicide smocks” in complete isolation, with some detainees choosing to not disclose suicidal ideation out of fear that they would be subjected to such treatment; and mentally-ill detainees were put in solitary confinement and de-scheduled from appearing before immigration judges despite having been determined to have a credible fear of returning to their home country. These abuses were systemic, not just one-time occurrences, with examples spanning from over 200 adult detention sites.

Gallagher first alerted her own colleagues of these abuses, since she understood the civil rights office’s mandate included both reviewing individual cases of misconduct as well as recommending policy changes to protect the rights and interests of immigrants in detention. When they declined to investigate, Gallagher brought the evidence of the misuse of solitary confinement at ICE detention facilities to the inspector general.

The inspector general promised to investigate whether ICE facilities use segregation properly and follow applicable detention standards. However, in two reports prior to the one issued last week, the watchdog failed to release any meaningful, site-wide data or conclusions regarding the use and impact of segregation for civil detainees in immigration custody. Even in this most recent report, the Inspector General only spot-checked four detention centers, none of which were mentioned in Gallagher’s whistleblowing disclosures. The report barely looked at mentally ill detainees. The recommendations suggested that the field offices that oversee the specific detention centers they investigated “ensure compliance” with existing federal detention standards, completely failing to address these same problems that exist across the entire ICE detention system.

Two other clients of ours, Drs. Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson, are medical and mental health subject matter experts working for the Department’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. They too tried to raise concerns about risks of harm to immigrants, especially children, to both CRCL and the Inspector General’s investigative team. Their concerns have also fallen on deaf ears.

Their disclosures detailed systemic weakness at Family Residential Centers that would exponentiate with expanded detention implemented under the zero-tolerance immigration policy and create imminent harm to migrant children. Last summer, we sent these disclosures to the Inspector General via fax and email.

We followed up with the watchdog throughout the fall by peppering them with emails. But the doctors’ disclosures went unanswered. As they wrote in the Washington Post last December, “We warned DHS that a migrant child could die in custody. Now one has.”

One watchdog’s non-response was echoed by the civil rights office, which, despite heightened outcry about harms posed by detention and the warnings of their own medical experts, has not conducted a single onsite investigation at family detention centers since September 2017. And perhaps even worse than non-action, DHS recently released a controversial new report in April 2019 that recommends confinement and detention of migrant children and overturning the Flores standards to allow for indefinite, prolonged detention.

This position is completely at odds with these whistleblowers’ disclosures, as well as the overwhelming medical research and consensus that detention of children, even with families, poses harm and indefinite detention exponentiates that harm.

Meanwhile, the abuses reported by these whistleblowers continue unabated, with no oversight or accountability by the agency watchdogs charged with promoting legal compliance and protecting the health, welfare and rights of immigrants held in civil detention. Because of the futility of internal oversight mechanisms, Gallagher and Drs. Allen and McPherson felt duty-bound to go to Congress and the press to raise the alarm and prevent foreseeable, ongoing risk of harm.

Twenty-four immigrants have died in ICE custody during the Trump administration.

Something is broken when the internal accountability mechanisms in the executive branch refuse to listen to whistleblowers, yet still claim to have held their agency accountable.

Yes, the recent Inspector General’s report did identify problems at four spot-checked sites exposed and recommend reforms for serious ICE abuses. But the striking contrast between the scope of the report and the scope of the problems we know have been raised by whistleblowers demonstrates that the OIG is not able, or willing, to meaningfully address ongoing and prevent future harms.

DHS’s watchdog mechanisms are broken and have consistently failed to prevent egregious harm to the thousands of vulnerable immigrants in DHS care. The concerns exposed by whistleblowers and reported in the press must not only be acknowledged, but fully investigated and addressed without any further delay. Congress must assert its oversight authority and exercise its oversight duty, immediately. The consequences of Congress failing to act are literally life and death.

Dana Gold is the director of education and a senior counsel with the Government Accountability Project, where she currently represents multiple immigration whistleblowers. Irvin McCullough is a national security analyst with the Government Accountability Project, where he helps national security whistleblowers disclose wrongdoing free from retaliation."
Dominican Republic official pushes back as US State Department hikes number of American tourist deaths to 10,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/world/2019/06/dominican-republic-official-pushes-back-as-us-state-department-hikes-number-of-american-tourist-deaths-to-10/,"Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

(SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic) — Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

The tourism minister said the number of Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic has actually decreased this year, and that over the last three years there was a 56% reduction in the number of U.S. tourist deaths in the DR.

On Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed the death of Mark Hurlbut in the Dominican Republic in June 2018.

State Department officials also recently announced that Thomas Jerome “Jerry” Curran of Bedford, Ohio, died on Jan. 26, 2019, while traveling in the Dominican Republic with his wife, Janet.

Curran, a retired police officer, and Hurlbut join a list of eight other people who have died in the Dominican Republic in the last year, including Yvette Monique Sport, who died in June 2018; David Harrison, who died in July 2018; and Robert Wallace, Miranda Schaupp-Werner, Cynthia Day, Nathaniel Holmes and Joseph Allen, who all died this year.

“To say that an exaggerated number of Americans have died in the Dominican Republic, what some media have characterized as an avalanche of deaths, does not correspond with the reality that we are seeing today in the Dominican Republic,” Garcia said.

No link between the deaths has been established, and U.S. State Department officials say there has been no “uptick” in American deaths in the Caribbean country.

The attorney for Holmes and Day, the couple who was found dead in their Dominican Republic hotel room in May, responded to Garcia’s press conference, saying, “We will let the facts and medical reports tell the story. The family continues to mourn the death of their love ones.”

Dominican authorities have asked for the FBI’s help in conducting toxicology analyses in the investigation into the deaths of Schaupp-Werner, Day and Holmes. Garcia did not release any new information about the cases, including toxicology reports that might shed light on the tourists’ cause of death.

FBI officials have informed Dominican authorities that getting the results of the toxicology analyses could take up to 30 days, and it could be an additional two weeks until the results are released. Garcia said the reports so far have not been shared due to privacy concerns.

Speaking specifically about the case of Holmes and Day, Garcia said that because the Dominican Republic has “nothing to hide,” they asked the FBI to participate and to conduct an additional toxicity report.

Garcia said the Dominican Republic’s tourism industry has been a “model” for the world because of its standards.

Trump’s decision-making on Iran strike highlights absence of a confirmed defense secretary,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Sonne', 'National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military', 'June At Pm']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-decision-making-on-iran-strike-highlights-absence-of-a-confirmed-defense-secretary/2019/06/22/6f617d8c-950e-11e9-b72d-d56510fa753e_story.html,"When the White House summoned the Pentagon’s top civilian leader to consider a possible military strike against Iran, two men answered the call: Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary who had just announced he would step down amid revelations of family violence, and Mark T. Esper, the Army secretary slated to replace him, who had no formal standing to be in the room.

The arrival on Thursday of the two men at the White House, neither of whom came with the Senate’s imprimatur to sit at the table, brought into sharp relief the perils of a civilian leadership void that President Trump has tolerated at the Pentagon for more than half a year since Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary.

The end result — an 11th-hour reversal of a military strike that could have sparked an open conflict with Iran — fed into the fears of those who saw Mattis as a bulwark against a process that could leave matters of war and peace up to Trump’s last-minute whims and his interactions with cable news commentators. The deliberations over how to respond to Iran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. drone highlighted the absence of a top Pentagon civilian leader armed with the experience and status necessary to influence the commander in chief.

[‘I stopped it’: How Trump’s last-minute reversal on Iran unfolded]

“In the end this is a human process,” said Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary and CIA director for President Barack Obama. “What human beings tend to do is they make judgments about people who are at the table, and whether or not they have the strength and the position and the knowledge and the experience to be able to voice their opinions.”

“If they know that somebody is acting,” Panetta said, “if they know that somebody is just there on a temporary basis, then mark my words: There is an automatic assumption that what they say doesn’t carry a lot of weight.”

Signs have emerged that the crisis with Iran has possibly been a wake-up call for the White House about the need to install a permanent leader at the Pentagon quickly, despite Trump’s predilection for acting officials. After urging from impatient Republican lawmakers, Trump announced late Friday that he would nominate Esper to replace Mattis on a permanent basis.

“The Department does not discuss meetings with the Commander in Chief — including who is in attendance,” Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement. “There is no confusion by anyone at the Pentagon — or to our adversaries — as to who is the head of the United States Department of Defense.”

He said Shanahan would be acting secretary until midnight on Sunday, and Esper will take over the first minute of Monday.

Esper comes with defense qualifications that outstrip Shanahan’s, having served for years as an Army officer, a policy adviser in Congress, a top Pentagon official, a defense industry lobbyist and an executive at a well-known conservative think tank. Most recently, he ran the U.S. Army as its top civilian, overseeing the manning and equipping of the largest branch of the American military by personnel.

Esper studied in the same U.S. Military Academy class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, giving him a long-standing relationship with the most important fellow Cabinet official for most secretaries of defense. He also has worked for the past year and a half in tandem with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the top uniformed officer in the Army, who is due to take over this fall from Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. as next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“It’s crucial to have someone at the helm of the Pentagon who can look across the complicated international security landscape, across the regional issues and the functional issues, and recognize the pros and cons of using military force,” said Mara Karlin, a former top Pentagon strategist in the Obama administration who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Shanahan did not have the political experience or the policy experience to do this, but appeared to be trying.”

Karlin said that Esper has demonstrated a willingness to choose internal winners and losers in his management of the Army — a critical quality for a defense secretary — and also comes with a wealth of other experience in defense matters.

“The question is what does meaningful civilian control of the Pentagon look like?” Karlin said. “I think there is evidence that Army Secretary Esper could exert that. He has worked across the Washington apparatus. He has touched this world from a whole bunch of different perspectives.”

Whether Esper can gain the personal trust of Trump, and feel comfortable expressing independent views in front of the president, remains to be seen. During his nearly six months as acting secretary, Shanahan regularly faced explicit questions about his independence and standing with the president. With the imprimatur of the Senate, Esper may also be able to choose appointees for a number of Pentagon positions occupied by acting officials and build out a more robust staff.

Esper’s likely confirmation later this year comes after the extraordinary events surrounding Iran, which raised questions for former top officials about the decision-making process involving military action.

Previous presidents, including Obama and Bill Clinton, have made late-stage decisions to stand down on military strikes in the works, but Trump’s description of the moments that led up to his decision is what raised alarm bells for some former officials.

In tweets and an interview with NBC News, Trump said that minutes before the military action was due to launch, he asked his generals how many Iranians would die, and when he heard approximately 150, he stopped the planned strike because he felt it wasn’t proportionate. If the president’s version of events is true, former top Pentagon officials say, it represents at worst a breakdown in the chain of command and at best a departure from the traditional practice of running through the casualty impact of military actions well before any decisions are made.

“I can’t think of a more chaotic situation than to have the president abort an operation while military forces are moving into position to conduct a military action — and do so on the basis that he wasn’t told pertinent information,” said Jeremy Bash, a former top official at the Pentagon and the CIA during the Obama administration. He described that process, if it played out the way Trump described it, as a “train wreck.”

The lack of a confirmed defense secretary during the deliberations Thursday also would have put an unfair onus on the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador and top Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration. The chairman is the official military adviser to the president, but the defense secretary is supposed to present the broader implications of any military options, and they tend to coordinate on their position on a military strike before presenting options to the White House.

“You’ve created this imbalance where you have one guy with a foot out the door and the other guy who hasn’t been nominated yet — how are they going to opine or say anything meaningful that is going to have an impact on the process?” Edelman said. “Then it puts everything in the hands of the chairman, which isn’t fair.”

Ultimately, the decision about the use of force rests with the commander in chief; a deliberative and considered process leading up the decision is designed to give the president confidence that all options were examined carefully. It also can assure the public that decisions possibly resulting in the death of U.S. troops, enemy forces or civilians on the ground are made in a way that isn’t cavalier.

“The toughest decision a president has to make is to deploy forces in harm’s way. Every president I’ve worked with, that’s what tears their insides out,” Panetta said. “But if you at the very least go through that process — and evaluate all these issues and the consequences — then at the end of the day you have to make a tough decision, but at least it is one that is carefully considered.”"
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

The State Department condemned China and Iran on Friday for treating religious minorities as national security threats meriting surveillance, imprisonment and sometimes death.

In introducing the annual report on International Religious Freedom, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck an unusual personal note, noting he had been a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, and took a swipe at Washington.

“That might sound unusual to a lot of people inside the Beltway,” he said. “But I am one of millions of Americans, and billions of people across the world, who live in the knowledge of a higher power. I often humbly reflect on how God’s providence has guided me to this office, to defend this cause.”

Samuel Brownback, the ambassador for religious freedom, said: “We believe there is no more important time for the United States to promote religious freedom than now.”

The annual report looks at the government policies that violate religious belief and practices in every country of the world except the United States.

China and Iran are among 10 countries of particular concern when it comes to religious freedom, meaning they may face sanctions. The chapters are considerably longer than those of North Korea, which Brownback called “horrible” for religious freedom, or on Myanmar, where ethnic Rohingya have been subjected to harassment and violence.

The report was released amid growing tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as China.

The United States and China have been in a trade war for nearly a year. While talks go on, the Trump administration has shied away from placing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the detention of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Brownback said some sanctions have been placed on the manufacturers of equipment used to surveil religious minorities, and the United States frequently raises its concerns publicly.

Iranian Christians and other religious minorities are among those who have lost opportunities to emigrate to the United States as part of deep cuts in refugee admissions from Iran. Brownback said the criteria for religious minorities getting preference as refugees changed during the Obama administration, and it is time for the policy to be reviewed.

The religious freedom report lists detailed accounts of religious minorities in countries around the world who were subjected to “death, forced disappearances, and organ harvesting in prison because of their religious beliefs or affiliation.”

Pompeo has spoken forcefully against the treatment of Uighur Muslims sent to what he has called “reeducation camps.” U.S. attempts to berate the Chinese have sparked little change, however. After Pompeo met with four Uighurs in March to discuss human rights abuses, the aunt and uncle of one of them, a U.S. citizen, learned his aunt and uncle had been moved from a camp and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The report said Chinese Christians also have been increasingly oppressed, with authorities closing churches, burning bibles and ordering believers to renounce their faith.

The chapter on Iran accuses the government of meting out harsh punishments to those who are not Shiite Muslims. Iran’s penal code specifies death for crimes like enmity against God, corruption on earth and insulting the prophets.

But there is little the U.S. government can do about it, except protest publicly. With no diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington, the report says, U.S. diplomats “did not have opportunities to raise concerns directly with the government over its religious freedom abuses and restrictions.”"

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
DOJ names Mount Pleasant officer involved in shooting,https://www.nbc15.com,[],,,,https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Update--511697521.html,"Authorities have identified the Mount Pleasant police officer who shot and killed an 18-year-old man earlier this month.

The state Department of Justice says in a release that Sgt. Eric Giese, a 12-year-veteran of the force, fatally shot Tyrese West, of Racine, on June 15. Giese has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in a fatal officer-involved shooting.

The Racine Police Department, which is handling the investigation, said earlier that the officer attempted to make contact with West when West fled on a bicycle. Following a short pursuit, Giese saw that West was armed. Less-lethal force was unsuccessful and West ignored the officer's commands before Giese fired.

Lifesaving measures failed. A handgun was recovered from the scene, which is just a few blocks south of Racine.

Members of the Racine Police Department Investigative Division and a Racine Police Department Chaplain made notified family on the date of the incident. Follow-up contact with immediate family members will occur as the facts become known and additional information is available to share with them.

No further information is available for release at this time, according to the department."
Chip stocks fall after Commerce Dept bars 5 more Chinese companies from buying US parts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/chip-stocks-fall-after-commerce-dept-bars-5-more-chinese-firms-from-buying-us-parts.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department has banned five more Chinese entities from buying U.S. components after blacklisting telecom giant Huawei last month.

Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Sugon and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the five Chinese firms added to the department's entity list, according to a filing.

The department said the activities of these companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""

Shares of U.S. semiconductors came under pressure after the announcement. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled more than 3%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also fell 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The move came before President Donald Trump's key meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit this month to discuss the lingering trade differences. The U.S. and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, while ramping up tit-for-tat threats in the ongoing trade war.

The Commerce Department said Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the leaders in China's development of exascale high-performance computing.

Sugon has publicly acknowledged ""a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers,"" the department said. Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is ""to support China's military modernization,"" the department noted.

The U.S. restrictions on Huawei have forced many American chipmakers and tech companies including Google to cut ties with the Chinese giant. Huawei's U.S. chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are reportedly quietly lobbying to ease the Huawei ban."
Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"
"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

Climate change: What 10 presidents have known,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-what-10-presidents-have-known-60-minutes-2019-06-23/,"There's a White House memorandum that addresses ""the carbon dioxide problem"" in straightforward terms. The process, it reads, is simple. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has the effect of a pane of glass in a greenhouse. With all the fossil fuels man is now burning, more carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere and raising temperatures, which in turn will raise sea levels.

""Goodbye New York,"" it reads. ""Goodbye Washington, for that matter.""

The memo isn't remarkable for its dire warning. It's noteworthy because it is dated almost 50 years ago: September 17, 1969.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an adviser to President Richard Nixon at the time, authored it to raise awareness of the ""apocalyptic change.""

""I would think this is a subject that the Administration ought to get involved with,"" he wrote.

The memo is one of hundreds of records submitted in Juliana v. United States, a court case against the federal government. As correspondent Steve Kroft reports this week on 60 Minutes, a lawyer filed the case in 2015 on behalf of a group of kids who want the courts to block the U.S. government from continuing to support fossil fuels.

Oregon lawyer Julia Olson is leading the charge, along with 21 ""climate kids"" she recruited from environmental groups around the country. The kids range in age from 11 to 22 and include lead plaintiff Kelsey Juliana, a University of Oregon student.

The suit alleges that the use of fossil fuels is causing climate change, and the government's continued support of the fossil fuel industry endangers the plaintiffs' future and violates their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.

Olson began constructing the case eight years ago and has now assembled a timeline of what past presidential administrations knew about the connection between fossil fuels and climate change. The records stretch back more than 50 years, beginning with President Lyndon Johnson, and Olson feels they prove that each president since has known about the potentially catastrophic effects of fossil fuels.

University of Oregon student Kelsey Juliana is the lead plaintiff in Juliana v. United States

""Our government, at the highest levels, knew and was briefed on it regularly by the national security community, by the scientific community,"" Olson told Kroft on the broadcast. ""They have known for a very long time that it was a big threat.""

One of the earliest documents is a federal science report authored in November 1965 by a panel of scientists and engineers from government, universities, and industries. The document, titled ""Restoring the Quality of Our Environment,"" includes a section co-authored by Charles David Keeling, the climate scientist whose readings of carbon dioxide first alerted the world to the possibility of the ""greenhouse effect.""

Keeling's section warns about high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and blames humans for burning coal, oil, and gas.

""Man is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment,"" it reads.

In total, the evidence Olson has collected amasses some 36,000 pages. She and her climate kids will introduce it all in court, should the case go that far.

The legal proceedings have required the government to make startling admissions in court filings. The government now acknowledges that human activity is likely to have been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid twentieth century, particularly by elevating concentrations of greenhouse gases.

In November 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken denied the government's motion to dismiss the case and ruled it could proceed to trial. The Trump administration has appealed Judge Aiken's decision three times to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and twice to the Supreme Court. It has failed each time.

Earlier this month, federal judges in Portland, Oregon heard arguments on both sides in Juliana v. United States.

60 Minutes producer Draggan Mihailovich reported the story with Kroft. In an interview with 60 Minutes Overtime's Ann Silvio, Mihailovich said the case has shifted the climate change dispute away from conservative versus liberals—and refocused it to a debate between young and old.

Eleven-year-old Levi Draheim (top) and 15-year-old Jayden Foytlin (bottom) are among the 21 ""climate kids"" suing the government

""I think kids 10 to 30, they're a lot more concerned about climate change than people in my generation or older,"" he said in the video above. ""For us old folks, we're underestimating a little bit how important the climate change issue is to that generation.""

Mihailovich said Olson initially expected to recruit around 10 kids for the lawsuit and was surprised to get 21. Each young person has a personal story of how climate change has affected them, Olson told Kroft, which they will testify to if there is a trial.

Although the kids seem to be ardently involved in the case—and express a very real fear about the future of climate change—Mihailovich acknowledged that Olson is very much taking the lead.

""I felt that there's no doubt that Julia is the driving force behind the lawsuit,"" Mihailovich said.

Oregon lawyer Julia Olson is leading the charge in the climate change suit

But when Kroft asked Olson if she's using the kids to accomplish her own environmental goals, she rejected the suggestion and countered it, saying the kids are using her as their lawyer.

Mihailovich put the question to climate kid Jayden Foytlin, a 15-year-old from Rayne, Louisiana whose family is still rebuilding from a 2016 storm that dumped 18 inches of rain on their town in just 48 hours.

""To the people that think that I'm brainwashed, I just usually say I have encountered climate change firsthand,"" Foytlin said. ""And although I am 15, I still know science. I still trust science more than I trust older generations that tell me that I'm wrong.""

Shocker: DOJ Files Suit to Block Quad From Acquiring LSC Communications,https://www.piworld.com,['Mark Michelson'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.piworld.com/article/shocker-doj-files-suit-to-block-quad-from-acquiring-lsc-communications/,"In what many printing industry observers, including myself, view as a shocking development, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Antitrust Div., filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on June 20 seeking to block Quad’s proposed $1.4 billion, all-stock acquisition of LSC Communications.

According to an article published by CTFN that quoted a person with inside knowledge of negotiations which were in process to reach a settlement agreement, ""As early as the morning of June 20, the DOJ was prepared to approve the merger with divestitures, but Quad's lawyers pushed back on the package."" The same individual also reportedly indicated that some type of resolution could still be presented, at some point, that would meet DOJ approval.

However, the DOJ lawsuit (click here to read the full complaint) on the surface appears very adamant about its opposition to the proposed merger of the two companies, and doesn't specifically divulge what divestitures would be required, if any, for the antitrust regulatory agency to ultimately approve the deal.

If the transaction is not consummated by Oct. 30, 2019 — or if there is a final, non-appealable court order preventing the acquisition — either Quad or LSC can terminate their merger agreement. In this case, Quad would also be required to pay LSC a “regulatory approval reverse termination fee” of $45 million.

The DOJ complaint maintains that the transaction would combine the only two significant U.S. providers of magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing services, denying publishers and retailers throughout the country the benefits of competition that has spurred lower prices, improved quality, and greater printing output.

“American publishers and retailers rely on Quad and LSC to print and distribute billions of magazines, catalogs, and books each year,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, of the DOJ’s Antitrust Div., in a statement. “LSC is Quad’s primary competitor. If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services, and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The lawsuit also contends that Quad/LSC’s gravure (Quad is the only remaining gravure long-run publication printer) and web offset printing and distribution resources vastly exceed those of their competitors, making them ""the only realistic options for many publishers and retailers.""

The DOJ complaint, which also cited several examples, alleges that Quad’s proposed acquisition of LSC would put an end to the “price war” between the two head-to-head competitors and allow the combined company to dominate the magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing markets.

They bid aggressively against each other by leveraging their scale and scope, and by undercutting one another’s prices, the DOJ complaint argued. This has led to reduced margins, which ultimately led Quad and LSC to contemplate a merger. ""As LSC [chairman, president and] CEO Tom Quinlan remarked to investors mere months before the current deal was announced, combining LSC and Quad would eliminate 'battle[s]' between the two and could help lead to '[p]ricing stability,'” the DOJ indicated.

The DOJ complaint specifically quotes internal presentations and emails describing the level of intense competition that exists between Quad and LSC:

Internal documents outline the “two-horse race between LSC and Quad.”

A Quad internal presentation explained, “we are the only printer other than LSC that can offer the largest publishers a complete solution.”

Executives observed a publisher “exploiting the fact that LSC [and] Quad[’s] CEOs want to beat each other into oblivion.”

A senior Quad executive remarked of LSC, “We’ve been in a price war with them for some time. Don’t see that changing.”

After hearing news of the merger, one Quad executive reflected on a recent battle between it and LSC and remarked, “I admit, in the case of [a large customer] I’m taking significant satisfaction in the news ... I’m sure it’s a bitter pill for them to swallow.”

Quad and LSC Will Defend Their Case Vigorously

For their part, Sussex, Wis.-based Quad and Chicago-based LSC plan to fight the ruling ""vigorously,"" arguing that their merger would create a highly efficient print manufacturing and distribution platform that will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world dominated by digital advertising.

“The DOJ’s position ignores the dynamic conditions in the U.S. commercial printing industry, which consists of nearly 50,000 companies, generates an estimated $76 billion in aggregate annual revenues, and provides ample competition for the supply of printed products, especially in the face of decreasing demand,"" Joel Quadracci, Quad chairman, president and CEO, said in a release issued by Quad. ""Neither Quad nor LSC accounts for more than 5% of that total print industry revenue. By comparison, two digital media companies, Google and Facebook alone, have worldwide digital ad sale revenues totaling more than $75 billion – nearly the same amount as the entire printing industry.

""This underscores a key point: Our competition is not only other printers, but also other forms of media. Quad is in the business of manufacturing advertising and, therefore, is a direct competitor to digital channels,"" Quadracci added. ""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels, the printing industry has pursued platform consolidations as a key way to eliminate inefficient and expensive overcapacity, streamline operations and create the efficiencies. This will help ensure print remains an economically feasible alternative to digital channels for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook. The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

Similarly, LSC issued a statement contending why the merger would benefit the companies’ clients:

There is significant excess capacity in the printing industry today and this transaction would improve efficiencies and lower printing costs;

Many printers have the capability to print the same jobs as LSC Communications or Quad and successfully compete with both companies on quality and price;

Barriers to expansion and entry in the printing business are low and printers can easily expand their production capacity through acquisitions or with modest capital expenditures on equipment and facilities that are readily available; and

The trend toward digital substitution increases competition and disincentives price increases.

“We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our transaction and that its action is counterproductive, especially in the context of the industry trends and continued consolidation,"" LSC Chairman, President and CEO Quinlan said. ""We continue to believe that our proposed combination will provide an overall more efficient experience for our clients.""

What Were the Stumbling Blocks for Approval?

As reported by Printing Impressions earlier, apparently one of the DOJ's issues was the fact that Quad is the only remaining printer with rotogravure printing capabilities suited for long-run (1 million or more copies) publication printing. More likely, though, what DOJ considered is the dominant position the combined entities would have on the mailing and distribution side of the business.

In May 2018, LSC announced its acquisition of RR Donnelley's Print Logistics business. That followed on the heels of its July 2017 acquisition of Fairrington Transportation, a mailing and logistics provider. And, in November of last year, it purchased The Clark Group, a third-party logistics provider of distribution, consolidation, transportation management and international freight forwarding services.

As one savvy reader commented to Printing Impressions, ""Unless the DOJ intercedes, Quad is going to have a virtual monopoly on mail consolidation such as co-mail, co-pal and cross-docking, and also on newsstand distribution. Other than a small company here or there, nobody else has the kind of firepower that Quad will have.

""I should point out that other printers have long relied on RRD/LSC/Quad or companies they have recently acquired, like Fairrington or The Clark Group, for these distribution services,"" he added. ""Let's face it, Quad is not paying for the merger via synergies by combining Quad with LSC. They will pay for it by charging more for distribution of printed product. They can — and will — muscle their smaller competitors out of business to take the work that fits their platform.

""These are the conversations I have had with competitors in the printing business and partners in the publishing world. But because we all will rely on Quad for these services, we can only hope and pray the DOJ intercedes some how,"" he concluded.

For now, the wish of that printer appears to have been granted. And, one can only wonder about the amount of turmoil that must now be occurring internally within the Quad and LSC organizations, as well as among their respective customer bases. For some time now the companies undoubtedly have been preparing their internal operations and advising their external customer bases in preparation for the merger they assumed would happen. But now, with this latest development, everything remains up in the air as to whether or not the deal will ultimately be consummated.

In the end, that's not good for Quad nor LSC. Nor is that sense of uncertainty good for an industry as a whole that — at least from the perspective of Wall Street and Main Street — is already facing a large degree of uncertainty and upheaval."
Vietnam veteran receives long-awaited settlement from Veterans Affairs,https://www.naplesnews.com,"['Andrew Atkins', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.naplesnews.com/story/life/2019/06/22/vietnam-war-vet-receives-va-settlement-after-many-years/1479610001/,"CLOSE Joseph Mattera talks about his Veterans Administration experience during an interview at his home, Tuesday, June 18, 2019, in East Naples. Jon Austria, jaustria@gannett.com; 239-227-7803

An East Naples man served two years in Vietnam and it took nearly 20 years to receive benefits from the government for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Joseph Mattera enlisted in the Marines, leaving from Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wanted to go to Vietnam and was a private first class. He finished his two years of service in 1971.

“You realize that the childhood idea of being in combat is very scary,” he said.

Mattera sought aid upon returning home from the Marines as a veteran from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in 1971 for anxiety, which he later discovered was PTSD. Mattera said he took part in ambushes against the enemy.

Doctors handed him a bottle of Valium and sent him on his way, he said.

Decades later, in the early 2000s, the VA provided help for his Agent Orange-related diabetic condition but denied his claim for PTSD.

Mattera did not give up the fight. He hired an attorney, Sean Ravin of Coral Gables, in 2005. That wasn’t enough.

(Photo: Jon Austria/Naples Daily News USA TODAY NETWORK - FLORIDA)

“The VA received his claim and basically denied his claim because they couldn’t confirm his stressor,” Ravin said.

Alexandra Scardino, the Collier County Veterans Services manager, said veterans filing claims for PTSD with the VA need to indicate a “stressor.” For combat-decorated veterans like Purple Heart recipients, additional documentation is not needed.

Otherwise, they may need documentation showing they saw combat or to provide a statement explaining the stressor they experienced while serving.

Ravin said attorneys and advocates like himself file letters of inquiry with the VA and frequently go to court to force the VA into action. But Ravin lost contact with Mattera and later found out Mattera had moved from Boston to East Naples.

“Unfortunately, Joe had sort of drifted off the screen from me,” Ravin said.

Mattera went to the VA again, he said, and explained in more detail what he experienced overseas. A doctor agreed he had PTSD.

The VA closed Mattera’s case without making a decision in 2009, Scardino said.

“Nothing ever happened,” Mattera said.

Mattera started going to Veterans Services in 2017 for help with his disability benefits related to his Agent Orange exposure. When his regular Veteran Services Officer, Irene Johnson, was out for the day, Mattera met with Eddie Hartnack.

Hartnack, who is now retired, was able to identify with a fresh set of eyes and decades of experience that the PTSD claim Mattera filed was closed without a decision.

“Veterans come in for one thing and get another,” Scardino said.

Once Hartnack identified the issue, Veterans Services filed a letter of inquiry, and Mattera received a settlement of $242,000 in April; though 20% will go to Ravin as a contingency fee.

While Scardino said cases like Materra’s are uncommon, Ravin said it is common for cases to take so long.

“I think the fault does lie entirely with the VA, because they’re supposed to move these cases along,” Ravin said. “At least the case has a happy ending.”

The VA could not comment on Mattera's case for privacy concerns. However, Deputy Director of the VA Office of Public Affairs Southeast District Candace Hull said in a statement that as of May 31, the average time between someone filing a disability claim and receiving a letter about the claim was 19½ days.

""VA is currently processing claims, on average, in 103 days. There are currently 76,327 disability claims pending over 125 days in the inventory, down from a peak of 611,000 in March of 2013,"" Hull said in the statement.

Pitfalls lie not just in the process of navigating the VA benefit system, Scardino said, but veterans could hypothetically lose benefits if they file to receive more benefits and the VA decides to reevaluate the veteran.

Mattera was concerned about that, Scardino said, which led to some of his discouragement.

“He just wanted help,” she said.

The decision from the VA meant the world for Mattera.

“It meant that my feelings were real,” he said. “My frustrations I felt my whole life were validated.”

His fiancé, Karen Kolosz, said it was more than the money.

“It was the acknowledgement that the condition existed,” she said.

Both she and Mattera are grateful for the county Veterans Services office for the help they provided, and they — and Scardino — want more veterans to know about the resources available to veterans and their families.

While Scardino said the number of clients the office has seen over the past several years has grown consistently, she still only sees a few thousand of the 30,000 veterans she estimates live in Collier County. For fiscal year October 2016 through September 2017, her office saw about 3,200 clients, she said. The next fiscal year, that increased to about 3,500 clients.

Services provided by Scardino’s office are free, she said, and it typically takes about two business days for veterans to get an appointment with her or the other service officers. Walk-in appointments are taken on Tuesdays and emergency appointments are available for those in dire need.

“I hope Mr. Mattera’s case reaches out to other veterans,” Scardino said.

Mattera spoke highly of the hard work by Ravin and Veterans Services, appreciating that they did not give up in trying to get results from the VA.

“You do need people to roll these people over,” he said.

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

For many, President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Joint Chiefs chairman: 'The last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran' Pence: 'We're not convinced' downing of drone was 'authorized at the highest levels' Trump: Bolton would take on the whole world at one time MORE’s EPA has been problematic from the get-go.

Met with confrontation, Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasn’t alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trump’s seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, it’s incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPA’s present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the “significant new use” rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, “If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.”

Last summer, ADAO discovered that Uralasbest, a Russian asbestos company, placed a seal with Trump’s face on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers.

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs – only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money but still had no degrees and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but after a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. In other words, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

The proposed rules would also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their problems – double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

That is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said the measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

What happens next?

Want to review the proposed rules yourself? Visit the Federal Register, where the proposal is available in its entirety.

The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website.

Any rule changes would follow the public comment period.

For the new director and CEO of the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System, a sense of duty and service goes back generations.

William “Bill” Caron, who just finished his second week at the helm of the North Las Vegas VA facility, is an Air Force veteran who began his medical career as a physical therapist at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

His grandfather served in World War II, and his father is a Vietnam-era veteran.

“Being a veteran and coming from a family of veterans, I was always compelled to serve this great nation,” he said Friday. “Even though I spent many years in the private sector, I really felt drawn back to service.”

Caron will oversee delivery of health care to 63,000 veterans, a $540 million annual operating budget, and ensure outpatient and inpatient services are available to more than 140,000 veterans residing in Clark, Lincoln and Nye counties.

Experience and leadership

“We are excited to bring Bill on board as the new Director of the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System,” John Brandecker, Veterans Integrated Service Network 21 director, said in a press release. “His sound leadership qualities and proven experience will be valuable assets for the facility, the employees and volunteers, and most importantly, for the Veterans we are honored to serve.”

Caron, who holds a bachelor’s degree in physical therapy and a master’s degree in health care administration, joined the VA in 2010 as associate director of the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan.

From 2014 to 2017, he served as associate director at the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System, which included a stint as acting director from May to December 2015. He worked alongside former director Peggy Kearns, who retired April 13 after 36 years of service.

In 2017, he became director of the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System in Tucson, Arizona.

Prior to joining the VA, Caron was a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Reservist while in college and began his medical career as a physical therapist in the private sector.

He then entered active duty with the U.S. Air Force where he served in the Biomedical Service Corps as a physical therapist at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

He also served in leadership roles during a 14-year career in the private sector where he managed multiple clinical services. He is also a fellow of the American College of Health Care Executives.

‘Keep marching forward’

Caron said he sees the chance to come back to Southern Nevada as a way to keep expanding the North Las Vegas hospital.

“We have a unique opportunity here at VA Southern Nevada to continue to grow, just like the city is growing, in a progressive manner,” he said. “We’re in the infancy stage of growing our research program, as well as our academic collaboration.”

Caron said he’s excited to continue to participate in the growth of UNLV’s medical school. He hopes to match Tucson with a robust academic affiliation to work with medical students, residents and fellows to develop high, complex care.

“We have the potential here to become a level 1A, highest complexity facility as well because of that progressive environment,” he said. “There’s a road to go to get there, but it’s definitely within our cross-hairs.”

Caron said he hopes to expand upon the foundation that Kearns set, by focusing on primary care, recruitment, staffing, mental health and specialty care. He especially is focused on staying aligned with federal initiatives that support outreach for veterans suicide.

“It takes a village. …The important component we’re finding is we need veterans to engage in the mental health services we provide,” he said. “Those that do engage are far less likely to attempt and, God forbid, complete suicide.”

Caron said he is looking forward to being involved in the Southern Nevada community, which he said is appreciative and supportive of the veteran community.

“The VA, much like your time in the military, is a family. All gave some, and some gave all,” he said. “That has helped me stay grounded and stay focused on what the goal is. Despite the bureaucratic hurdles we run into sometimes, we just have to keep marching forward.”

Trump’s EPA just replaced Obama’s signature climate policy with a much weaker rule,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684054/climate-change-clean-power-plan-repeal-affordable-emissions,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday killed President Obama’s signature climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan (CPP). It’s one of the few definitive wins in the Trump administration’s full-court press to undo and weaken environmental regulations.

Speaking before an audience that included coal miners wearing reflective shirts and hard hats, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler criticized the Obama policy, which required states to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and aimed to reduce US power sector emissions 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

“The CPP would have asked low- and middle-income Americans to bear the costs of the previous administration’s climate plan,” Wheeler said. “One analysis predicted double-digit electricity price increases in 40 states under the CPP.”

The EPA is still required to regulate greenhouse gases, but the CPP’s new replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, is drastically weaker. The ACE rule would lower power sector emissions by 11 million tons by 2030, or between 0.7 percent and 1.5 percent. The EPA noted that long-term industry trends are expected to still push emissions down 35 percent, but that’s largely independent of the ACE rule.

Speaking at the announcement, White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Wednesday that US emissions are “flat or down.” That is wrong. In fact, US greenhouse gas emissions are on the rise after years of decline.

So the new ACE rule is likely to do little to slow the US power sector’s impact on the global climate. According to some researchers, the new policy itself could actually increase greenhouse gas emissions, even compared to business as usual. And according to the EPA’s own assessments last year, the proposal will lead to thousands more deaths from air pollution.

However, environmental groups are gearing up to file legal challenges to the ACE rule. And despite its intentions, the new regulation would do little to slow the decline of the US coal industry.

The EPA is required to regulate greenhouse gases, but the law doesn’t say it has to be enthusiastic about it

As much as the Trump administration doesn’t want to do it, the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency has to limit greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if they’re a threat to public health. The EPA’s 2009 endangerment finding for carbon dioxide determined just that.

So the Trump administration couldn’t just repeal the CPP; it needed a plausible replacement to fight climate change. The ACE rule is an attempt at that.

“I believe this is the first rule in EPA’s history that acknowledges the existential threat of climate change but by the agency’s own admission does absolutely nothing to stop it,” said former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in a statement.

The critical detail here is how the ACE rule intends to lower emissions compared to the CPP. The EPA is required to lay out a standard known as “best system of emission reduction.” Under the Obama administration, this included pricing carbon dioxide, switching to cleaner power generation fuels, or capturing carbon dioxide emissions.

The new ACE rule leans on one method: efficiency. The technical term is “heat rate improvement,” and it means is that fossil fuel-burning power plants would be pushed to draw more energy from the same amount of fuel. This would lower the carbon intensity of the energy generated.

However, generating more energy from the same amount of fuel makes the fuel more cost-effective. That in turn could lead to a rebound effect where utilities end up burning more fuels like coal and natural gas. According to a study published in April in Environmental Research Letters, the ACE rule would lead to 28 percent of the power plants modeled in the study to emit more carbon dioxide by 2030 compared to a scenario with no policy at all.

This rebound effect can also lead to an increase of other air pollutants like particulates, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. In the EPA’s own regulatory impact assessment for the ACE rule published last year, the agency noted that these extra pollutants could cause between 460 and 1,400 additional deaths per year by 2030, in addition to exacerbating other ailments like asthma.

The ACE rule is part of a concerted, and largely futile, strategy across the Trump administration to boost coal

President Trump has made no secret of his love of fossil fuels in general and coal in particular. His Administration has gone to extreme lengths to boost the sector, from opening up unprecedented amounts of public land to mining to trying to use emergency powers to bail out money-losing coal plants.

The EPA is also working to relax Mercury and Air Toxics Standards that limit hazardous pollution from existing coal-fired power plants. For new coal-fired generators, the EPA is working to relax New Source Performance Standards that govern how much carbon dioxide new power plants are allowed to emit.

The EPA is justifying these changes by arguing that the costs of implementing new environmental controls like scrubbers for flue gases is too high. The agency is also changing how it calculates the benefits of limiting emissions, proposing a shift to a model that yields far fewer saved lives and health benefits.

Scientists on EPA advisory boards who received research grants from the agency have also been forced out of their positions. EPA officials said this was a move to prevent conflicts of interest, but the agency has allowed scientists from industries regulated by the EPA as well as researchers from states that have sued the EPA to continue advising it.

Trump’s EPA has also taken steps to restrict the scientific research it uses to form regulations, arguing that all research that informs rulemaking should be reproducible and make underlying data public. Health advocates say that this would exclude important research on one-off events like chemical leaks, and patient privacy concerns prevent some researchers from releasing their underlying work.

The net result of these changes is a suite of policies that make it easier to keep existing coal power plants online and clear the path for any new plants.

But it’s not regulations that are driving out the coal industry in the United States; it’s competition, especially from natural gas.

Large utility @DukeEnergy, which generates 33% of its electricity from coal, tells me of Trump's ACE rule intended to keep coal plants running longer: ""Based on what we know today, we don’t believe the rule will have significant impacts on our business plans for our coal plants"" — Joshua Siegel (@SiegelScribe) June 19, 2019

So it’s unlikely that these new rules would move the needle for the coal industry, and more coal-fired power plants are slated to be closed this year.

The Affordable Clean Energy rule obviates one legal headache for the EPA, but is creating another one

Trump’s EPA has argued that the Obama plan exceeded the agency’s authority and that the new proposal fits within the confines of the law. When the CPP was announced, 27 states sued to block it. Then, in an unusual move, the Supreme Court in 2016 ruled 5-4 to stay the Clean Power Plan to allow state lawsuits to proceed, preventing it from ever going into effect.

With the Affordable Clean Energy rule finalized, those lawsuits are now moot.

The latest repeal is at the intersection of two Trump Administration priorities outlined in executive orders: to roll back regulations and to promote US energy development, particularly fossil fuels. And unlike other environmental rollbacks at the EPA that have been delayed, bogged down in bureaucratic muck, or stalled by lawsuits, the ACE rule, now that it has been finalized, might stick.

But New York Attorney General Letitia James has already announced her intent to sue the Trump administration over the ACE rule and expects other states to join the litigation. Other state attorneys general have also come out to oppose the Trump administration’s new power plant rule. That means another wave of court cases could stall the EPA’s new rule."

Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/schiff-doj-campaign-spying-probe-1370713,"House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Justice Department investigations into the origins of the Russia probe were part of an effort to ""ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election."" | Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo congress Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe Attorney General Bill Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign.

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"
