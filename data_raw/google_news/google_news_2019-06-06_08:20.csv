Trump Administration Sharply Curtails Fetal Tissue Medical Research,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/fetal-tissue-research.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the federal government would sharply curtail federal spending on medical research that uses tissue from aborted fetuses, mainly by ending fetal-tissue research within the National Institutes of Health.

The move goes a long way toward fulfilling a top goal of anti-abortion groups that have lobbied hard for it; it is just the latest in a string of decisions that have pleased such groups. But scientists say the tissue is crucial for studies that benefit millions of patients.

Besides ending N.I.H. research, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would immediately cancel a $2 million-a-year contract with the University of California, San Francisco, for research involving fetal tissue from abortions; the contract started in 2013. Other university research projects would be subject to case-by-case review.

“Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration,” the department said in a statement. It added that about 200 research projects involving fetal tissue and conducted at universities with N.I.H. grants would be allowed to continue until their funding expires, but that ethics advisory boards appointed by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, would review and recommend whether to fund future individual projects involving aborted fetal tissue."
"Texas teacher fired over Twitter rant to Trump about ""illegal"" immigrant students",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-teacher-fired-fort-worth-school-board-terminates-georgia-clark-twitter-rant-to-trump-about-illegal-immigrants/,"A Texas school district has fired a teacher who went on a Twitter rant about illegal immigrants. The Fort Worth Independent School District announced Wednesday they voted 8-0 to terminate the contract of Georgia Clark.

Clark posted a string of tweets to President Trump from a now-deleted Twitter account. Clark tried to expose the school district for being ""loaded with illegal students from Mexico,"" as she wrote in one tweet, CBS Dallas / Fort Worth reported.

""Carter-Riverside High School has been taken over by them,"" Clark wrote to Mr. Trump. ""Drug dealers are on our campus and nothing was done to them.""

Clark asked the president for a contact in Fort Worth ""who should be actively investigating & removing illegals that are in the public school system."" The teacher admitted to the tweets, CBS Dallas Fort Worth reported.

CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reporter Erin Jones shared screenshots of several tweets Clark sent to the president.

Superintendent Kent Scribner addressed the offensive tweets in a message to parents last week.

""There has been much talk in the news and on the Internet about the use of social media by our staff,"" Scribner wrote. ""Our mission is to prepare ALL students for success in college, career and community leadership. Let me reiterate our commitment that every child in the District is welcome and is to be treated with dignity and respect.""

"An Orwellian Tale? Trump Denies, Then Confirms, ‘Nasty’ Comments About Meghan Markle",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/meghan-markle-nasty-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — By the time he left London on Wednesday, President Trump somehow ended his state visit there a full 360 degrees from where he started. Which was referring to the Duchess of Sussex, the American-born Meghan Markle, as “nasty.”

Assessing the perceived degree of nastiness of the duchess in an interview before he left the United States kick-started an Orwellian saga — one that the president single-handedly created, forcefully denied and then revived again just before jetting off for the next leg of his European tour.

The fracas began with an interview with the British tabloid The Sun last weekend, when Mr. Trump was recorded saying that he was not aware that the duchess had made “nasty” comments about him during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“What can I say?” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”

It was not the way previous American presidents have let the British know they were coming. The reaction to a sitting president commenting on the perceived nastiness of a member of Queen Elizabeth’s family — who put on a state dinner at Buckingham Palace, to impress and placate him — was reliably parsed along tribal lines."
President Trump causes uproar online for donning Winston Churchill hat during interview,https://www.foxnews.com,['Anna Hopkins'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-causes-uproar-online-for-donning-winston-churchill-hat-during-interview,"President Trump briefly wore a hat resembling the ones favored by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the reactions online were quick and ruthless.

The hat was given to the president by Piers Morgan while the two spoke Wednesday on a segment of ""Good Morning Britain,"" though Trump only donned it briefly before declaring that it looked better on Churchill. The hat was an apt gift given that the interview took place in the Churchill war rooms, where the prime minister made crucial decisions during World War II.

Before giving the gift to Trump, Morgan explained that the hat is made by Locke & Co. hatters, and revealed that the show had it monogrammed with the 45th president's initials.

Trump joked about the importance of his hair to his presidency, a topic which also made headlines this week when Trump visited a church in Virginia sporting a new look.

Eventually, however, Trump put on the hat for a brief moment -- which prompted users on social media to chime in.

And boy, did they ever.

One Twitter user modified a famous speech by Winston Churchill to poke fun at President Trump's bone spurs, which prevented him from being drafted in the Vietnam War.

“We shall fight them on the beaches. We shall fight them on the landing grounds. When I say ‘we’, I mean you, as I’ve got a doctor’s note. Bone spurs, you see. The greatest bone spurs ever,"" the tweet read.

Another user poked fun at Trump's ""obvious indifference"" to the hat, and the fact that the president claimed it was too big when he put it on.

Small in spirit, in valor, in dignity, in statecraft, this American president who knows nothing of history and cares still less and now bestrides Europe with his family in tow like some tin-pot dictator with a terrified entourage.

To have Donald Trump — the bone-spur evader of the Vietnam draft, the coddler of autocrats, the would-be destroyer of the European Union, the pay-up-now denigrator of NATO, the apologist for the white supremacists of Charlottesville — commemorate the boys from Kansas City and St. Paul who gave their lives for freedom is to understand the word impostor. You can’t make a sculpture from rotten wood.

It’s worth saying again. If Europe is whole and free and at peace, it’s because of NATO and the European Union; it’s because the United States became a European power after World War II; it’s because America’s word was a solemn pledge; it’s because that word cemented alliances that were not zero-sum games but the foundation for stability and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.

Of this, Trump understands nothing. Therefore he cannot comprehend the sacrifice at Omaha Beach 75 years ago. He cannot see that the postwar trans-Atlantic achievement — undergirded by the institutions and alliances he tramples upon with such crass truculence — was in fact the vindication of those young men who gave everything."

"CNN analyst Mudd: Christopher Steele should not talk to DOJ, could turn into 'car wreck'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnn-phil-mudd-christopher-steele-should-not-talk-to-doj,"A former FBI official and frequent critic of President Trump said Tuesday that Christopher Steele should avoid being questioned by the Justice Department, warning it could turn out disastrously for the former British spy.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

State Department suspends funding of anti-Iran Group which targeted journalists and activists,https://www.cnn.com,['Alex Marquardt'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-suspends-funding-anti-iran-group/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department has suspended funding for an organization whose hardline stance against the Iranian regime saw it targeting American journalists, activists and academics whom they didn't consider tough enough on Tehran, according to a State Department spokesperson.

The Iran Disinformation Project claims it ""exposes and counters the nefarious influence of one of the world's few remaining totalitarian regimes."" It has been funded through the State Department's Global Engagement Center which combats foreign propaganda and disinformation.

But the organization was so aggressive that social media accounts linked to it went after people it perceived to be too soft on Iran, at a time when the Trump administration is exerting what it calls ""maximum pressure,"" ratcheting up military and economic pressure on Iran after pulling out of the landmark nuclear deal known as the JCPOA.

The Guardian was first to report that the State Department had suspended funding.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor, told CNN Wednesday that an account associated with the organization was ""attacking me, other journalists, human rights advocates and others who have taken a more nuanced approach to US Iran relations and are opposed to war and crippling sanctions on that country.""

Rezaian, who is Iranian-American, spent 18 months in prison in Tehran and is a firm and frequent critic of the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a column Wednesday, he highlighted the organization's ""slander and libel"" against American citizens.

""For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran's 'mouthpieces,' 'apologists,' 'collaborators,' and 'lobbyists' in the West,"" he wrote.

Another target was Human Rights Watch's Tara Sepehri Far who researches human rights abuses in Iran. She recently wrote that American sanctions are ""collectively punishing"" ordinary Iranians and limiting their access to medicine.

In an April 25 tweet, the IranDisinfo account called Far a ""supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime"" and accused her of ""working hard to prove [Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's] claims.""

On Friday, Far tweeted: ""Many of us accepted that toxic slandering is part of the cost of being an analyst or doing human rights work in a very polarized climate of the US government's maximum pressure campaign, but now we realize that part of the slandering is actually being funded by US taxpayers.""

The State Department says it suspended the organization's funding on May 31, until it ""takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work.""

""The bulk of the work by @IranDisinfo has been in line with the scope of a project with the Department of State. We have, however, identified recent tweets that fall outside the scope of the project to counter foreign state propaganda or disinformation,"" a State Department spokesperson said.

The Global Engagement Center was set up in April 2016 under President Barack Obama and refocused after the presidential election primarily to combat Russian disinformation campaigns in the wake of their meddling in the campaign. Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement under Obama, said it was funded with $80 million.

""The problem was the Trump administration didn't really want to spend it because that meant recognizing that what Russia was doing on information warfare was a real threat,"" Bruen told CNN on Wednesday in an appearance alongside Rezaian.

""Instead what they have chosen to do is to spend that money and threaten American activists, threaten American journalists like Jason who don't agree with the Trump administration's stand on Iran. That's rather alarming and its quite dangerous,"" he added.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Global Engagement Center was refocused to combat Russian disinformation after the 2016 election and that Brett Bruen was Director of Global Engagement under President Obama."
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

Why Trump's Vietnam comments matter on D-Day,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/d-day-anniversary-us-presidents-service/index.html,"(CNN) On the 75th anniversary of a defining battle of the defining war of human history so far, it's clear that military service has never been less important to American voters.

Six US presidents served overseas during World War II, but none since President George H.W. Bush have gone abroad, if they served at all. At this point, we might get a President who served in Afghanistan or Iraq -- that's South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard or Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton -- but it's almost certain the US will never have a commander-in-chief who served in Vietnam.

It has had three, including Trump, who found a way around the draft. That's old news, but it doesn't mean Trump won't still have to answer questions about it, as he did in Wednesday's interview with the British journalist Piers Morgan, who asked him if he would have liked to have served.

Trump ""was never a fan"" of Vietnam

The interview was conducted in the underground bunker where Winston Churchill led the British government during the Blitz and World War II.

""Do you wish you'd been able to serve? Would you have liked to serve your country?"" Morgan asked.

Trump replied by questioning Vietnam, mirroring some of the anti-war sentiment of the '60s and '70s.

""Well I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever -- you're talking about Vietnam at that time and nobody ever heard of the country,"" Trump said, adding the non sequitur that, today, the government of Vietnam has been successful negotiating in global trade.

He went on to say that he wasn't active in protesting the war as a young man, but he didn't think the US should ever have taken part.

""But, uh, nobody heard of Vietnam and then say well what are we doing. So many people dying. So I was never a fan of -- this isn't like I'm fighting against Nazi Germany. I'm fighting -- we're fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people. Now I wasn't out in the streets marching. I wasn't saying, you know, I'm going to move to Canada, which a lot of people did. But no, I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something that we should have been involved in.""

Making up for lack of service with spending

When Morgan followed up, Trump said he's making up for his lack of military service by being President.

""Would you have liked to have served generally - perhaps in another (way)?"" Morgan asked.

""I would not have minded that at all. I would have been honored. But I think I make up for it now. I mean look, $700 billion I gave last year and then this year $716 billion and I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we are rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.""

This deserves a quick fact check. Trump did not personally give the military $700 billion or $716 billion. Congress did, when it passed appropriations bills last year. Trump signed them, and it is his administration's responsibility to now spend the money.

But it says something about how he views his role as President and the dismissive way he's treated Congress and its responsibilities, that he takes personal credit for spending taxpayer money.

It's also more than a bit awkward for him to argue that the military will be built up to a level it's never seen before under him when he's preparing to commemorate D-Day, when the entire country was mobilized in the war effort. More than 16 million Americans served in World War II from a US population of around 140 million in 1940. It was a total war, even for the US, which was far from any of the front lines.

Fewer Americans serve

The portion of the population that served in World War II is much larger than the portion that served during Vietnam, when more than 8.7 million Americans were in the military from a population of 203 million in 1970.

Despite the conflict in Afghanistan lasting longer than any in US history, fewer and fewer Americans have served in the military. The VA does not list a total number of service members during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are currently about 1.3 million people in the military, coming from a population of close to 341 million, according to Census projections

6 Presidents served overseas in World War II

In the years after World War II, military service was almost a prerequisite for politicians and presidents for generations during and after World War II. Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and gave the order for D-Day 75 years ago, went on to serve two terms as President. He ended hostilities in the Korean War shortly after taking office.

No more.

No presidents with Vietnam service

Three of the last four US presidents -- Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump -- had no military service at all. George W. Bush was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard -- his way around Vietnam.

Two other politicians who were of military age during Vietnam are running against Trump as Democrats. They also deferred military service or sought to be exempt. All three are in their 70s, which makes it likely this is the last presidential election in which a Vietnam-era politician will be featured.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is running for President as a Democrat, applied to be a conscientious objector during Vietnam . The application was ultimately rejected, but he was too old to be drafted at that point. In 2015, he said during a CNN debate that he's no longer a pacifist.

Two other politicians who came of age during Vietnam are running in the Democratic primary. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee received a student deferment and had a high draft number for his birth year, as did former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper

Plenty of Vietnam veterans have sought the White House, including medal of honor winner Bob Kerrey, who did not get very far. Several Vietnam veterans got their party's nomination, including Al Gore, John Kerry and John McCain.

Since the election of Bill Clinton over decorated former military pilot and wartime president George H.W. Bush in 1992, American voters have shown that avoiding service during Vietnam is not a dealbreaker.

A new generation of warrior politicians

A real question in 2020 is whether it's a desirable plus. There has been no draft since Vietnam, and there have been many fewer Americans serving in the military.

But there are multiple younger presidential aspirants who volunteered for the military and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Gabbard has made her military service a centerpiece of her campaign and cites it as the impetus for her platform of disentangling the US from foreign conflicts.

Charles Faulkner, a former lobbyist for Raytheon Co., was part of a move by the Trump administration to bypass congressional review and fast-track $8 billion in arms sales to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, according to the WSJ, citing current and former U.S. officials.

Faulkner left his post as deputy assistant secretary at the State Department after playing a role in efforts leading to the emergency declaration, according to the newspaper.

The declaration led to concerns in Congress about whether Faulkner had violated ethics rules by contributing to the declaration, which allowed Raytheon to sell $2 billion of precision-guided missiles to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, according to the WSJ.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans to hold a hearing next Wednesday regarding the emergency declaration, with Faulkner’s part in it expected to come up in the questioning. For the last two years, Faulkner served as both deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, according to the newspaper.

"Christopher Steele interview with DOJ 'will be a car wreck,' ex-intel officer Philip Mudd says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/christopher-steele-interview-with-doj-will-be-a-car-wreck-ex-intel-officer-philip-mudd-says,"A former intelligence official predicted British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s intention to meet with Justice Department investigators “will be a car wreck” and a “hot mess.”

Philip Mudd, a counterterrorism analyst for CNN and critic of President Trump, said on Tuesday he was confident Steele would have to tell the U.S. officials “no” if asked whether he could verify parts of his dossier that contained salacious claims about Trump's ties to Russia. That ""no"" would be disastrous for Steele in an interview with U.S. officials, Mudd claimed.

Attorney General William Barr declared his intention to look into the origins of the Russia investigation and examine how the DOJ and FBI conducted themselves. Trump recently gave Barr full declassification authority to aid in this inquiry, and he selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to serve as his right-hand man in the investigation. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz launched his own investigation into allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse a year ago.

An article this week from the Times in the United Kingdom said Steele was open to meeting with U.S. investigators and strongly indicated that Steele would speak with Horowitz’s team rather than Barr and Durham.

In a segment with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, Mudd condemned Steele’s decision, warning that “if you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant” and predicted that “this will be a car wreck.”

Mudd, a former deputy director of the CIA’s Counterterrorist Center and ex-deputy director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, said he did not think Steele would be able to back up the allegations contained in his dossier under questioning by U.S. officials. “Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and, I’m guessing, doesn’t have quality answers for the quality of that information in the Steele dossier,” Mudd said. “I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier.”

Mudd guessed that Steele is probably trying to clear his name, but said he does not think that would work. “If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Steele's dossier was used extensively in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Republican investigators have expressed concern about how FBI officials used unverified research to obtain warrants, and also did not reveal Steele's Democratic benefactors to the FISA Court.

Mudd said Steele's dossier, compiled while he was working for opposition research firm Fusion GPS, was not meant to be an intelligence document.

“He's supposed to gather the information and then the Republicans or Democrats use it in a political ad. This is not an intelligence game, this is a political game,"" he said in a separate appearance with CNN’s Don Lemon."

According to an affidavit, FBI agents arrested Mark Edward Allen, 60, for the possession of unregistered explosive devices.

Investigators say Allen placed the IED at the VA Hospital on May 29. His actions were captured on surveillance cameras.

The device contained a 9-volt battery, electrical wires, an improvised initiator, an unknown powder and a clothespin switch, according to documents.

On May 31, Allen's wife called police and reported he had been making other devices in his home.

Ultimately, the FBI determined the devices found at Bay Pines and at Allen’s house were similar and that Allen was responsible for both devices.

According to the arrest affidavit, Allen is a United States Army veteran.

If convicted, Allen faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison.

Allen is currently detained."

House Democrats’ resolution to hold Attorney General Bill Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt will include language that could grease the skids for Democrats’ coming lawsuit to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

It will include provisions designed to clarify House rules that a group of party leaders known as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, which is comprised of the five top House leaders, may authorize lawsuits, a Democratic aide said, something that’s been in dispute among legal experts.

Story Continued Below

Democrats plan to sue to enforce a subpoena for Trump’s tax records that the administration has denied, though lawmakers need to first authorize the suit. That could be done with a vote by the entire House, though it would be quicker to have BLAG handle it. Some experts, however, have questioned whether that’s allowed under the chamber’s rules.

Democrats have not decided how they intend to proceed when it comes to authorizing the suit, an aide said.

Democrats are demanding six year’s worth of Trump’s personal and some of his business records under a 1924 law allowing the heads of Congress’s tax committees to examine anyone’s private filings. The administration has rejected the subpoena, saying Democrats do not have a legitimate legislative reason for seeking the filings.

House Democrats plan to vote on the contempt resolution next Tuesday. Once either BLAG or the entire House gives the OK, the chamber’s general counsel, Douglas Letter, is expected to file suit on Democrats’ behalf for Trump’s returns.

Separately, Sen. Ron Wyden released a letter Tuesday to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig demanding to know whom at the agency had seen a draft memo leaked last month obtained by the Washington Post saying the administration must hand over Trump’s filings unless he invokes executive privilege.

"Trump says he ""would've been honored"" to serve in Vietnam War - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/trump-says-he-wouldve-been-honored-serve-vietnam-war-2019-jun,"PORTSMOUTH, England (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday joined world leaders to praise alliances and military service ahead of the anniversary of the D-Day invasion, just hours after offering no regrets when asked about whether he wished he had been able to serve in the Vietnam War.

Trump's comments came in a wide-ranging interview in which he also dismissed the significance of climate change, defended his choice of words about the American-born Duchess of Sussex and suggested he was looking into new gun regulations banning silencers. Later, while Europe slept, he lashed out at actress and singer Bette Midler and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., via Twitter.

The onslaught of disjointed news and commentary threatened to distract from Trump's purpose for the visit — to pay tribute to the veterans of the battle that shifted the course of World War II 75 years ago. Ahead of his trip, some worried the unpredictable president would inject politics into the typically solemn ceremony. While Trump did not veer off script during the memorial — expressing reverence for the bravery of veterans — his comments before the event expressed none of that sensitivity concerning service in Vietnam.

In the interview with Piers Morgan that aired Tuesday, Trump was asked if he wished he had served in Vietnam. ""Well, I was never a fan of that war, I'll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away,"" Trump said. ""At that time, nobody had ever heard of the country.""

Trump received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.

Trump was then asked whether serving in the military generally was something he would have liked. Trump said he would not have minded at all and talked about how he had beefed up spending on defense as president.

""I would have been honored, but I think I make up for it right now,"" Trump said. ""I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we're rebuilding our military at a level it's never seen before.""

Trump's first two days in the United Kingdom were all about honoring him, as Queen Elizabeth II and the British government showered him with a grand arrival ceremony, a state dinner and personal tours of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Churchill War Rooms. The next two days are meant to focus on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, and the soldiers who fought and died saving Europe from Nazi Germany.

Trump did his part with a 90-second recitation of some of the prayer that President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered to a worried nation just getting word of the fighting.

Trump, with images of an American flag and Roosevelt projected behind him, read to the crowd, ""Almighty God, our sons, pride of our nation, this day, have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity.""

The president sat in a VIP area between Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Melania Trump. Some 300 World War II veterans also attended the seaside ceremony. Trump joined in giving a standing ovation to a group of vets who appeared on stage as the commemoration began.

The queen provided the keynote address in unusually personal terms.

""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today,"" she said.

After the event, Trump visited with American World War II veterans who were among Allied troops on D-Day. He had lunch and met briefly with German Chancellor Angela Merkel before heading to Ireland for an airport meeting with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and a stay at his golf course in the village of Doonbeg, his first visit to the country as president.

Trump and Merkel discussed Libya and conditions in West Africa during their roughly 10-minute meeting, said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

Trump used his interview with Morgan to dispute any notion that he meant insult when he used the term ""nasty"" in discussing the American-born Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The phrase generated a lot of media coverage in the United Kingdom. Trump worked diligently to explain that he was speaking specifically on her comments about him, not about her.

Trump said: ""She was nasty to me. And that's OK for her to be nasty, it's not good for me to be nasty to her and I wasn't.""

He said the controversy did not come up when he spoke with Markle's husband, Prince Harry, who ""couldn't have been nicer.""

Trump was also asked about whether he would support banning silencers after a gunman in Virginia used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building.

Trump said a silencer ban was something ""I'm going to seriously look at."" But he also was quick to emphasize his opposition to restricting access to guns. He repeated his claim that ""in London, you have stabbings all over"" and said he had read a story describing how ""your hospital is a sea of blood, all over the floors."" Similar comments in the past have provoked anger from British doctors and legislators.

Trump said he discussed climate change at length with Prince Charles.

""We were going to have a 15-minute chat. And it turned out to be an hour and a half. And he did most of the talking,"" Trump said. ""He is really into climate change, and I think that's great.""

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, didn't indicate he was moved by the arguments he heard. ""I believe that there's a change in weather and I think it changes both ways,"" Trump told Morgan, a former contestant on Trump's ""The Celebrity Apprentice.""

Trump's after-midnight tweets showed anew that the president has a hard time overlooking criticism, taking on an actress who has been critical of him on Twitter but who also offered an apology when she discovered a quote attributed to Trump had not occurred. Trump called her a ""washed up psycho.""

Midler replied: ""I want to thank everyone who came to my defense last night during my personal Battle of the Bulge with he who must not be named. Your wit and good nature really lifted my spirits; as a newly washed up psycho, I am very grateful for your thoughts and prayers."""
V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."

Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Commerce officials to answer on census citizenship question amid contempt threat,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/447119-commerce-officials-agree-to-interviews-on-census-citizenship-question-amid,"The House Oversight and Reform Committee said Wednesday that three Commerce Department officials have agreed to sit for voluntary interviews as committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsHillicon Valley: FBI facial recognition database has 640M photos | Disclosure sparks new privacy fears | App developers sue Apple | House panel approves 0M for election security FBI database stokes worries over facial recognition tech FBI database stokes worries over facial recognition tech MORE (D-Md.) threatens a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrNadler rejects DOJ offer on Barr contempt vote Nadler rejects DOJ offer on Barr contempt vote Democrats addicted to gambling on losing challenges to Donald Trump MORE and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossTrump administration imposes new travel restrictions on Cuba Trump administration imposes new travel restrictions on Cuba DOJ fires back at allegations over GOP strategist's role in census citizenship question MORE in contempt.

The committee said in a statement that the Commerce Department agreed late Tuesday to let the committee conduct interviews with the three agency officials — general counsel Peter Davidson, deputy chief of staff and policy director Earl Comstock, and former senior adviser and counsel to the secretary James Uthmeier — after Cummings circulated a resolution to subpoena the men.

That subpoena vote has now been delayed, according to the panel. The committee is seeking the current and former officials' testimony as part of their investigation into the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The panel said Wednesday that it had first requested transcribed interviews with the officials on March 20 and sent letters requesting the interviews directly to the men on May 7.

Cummings on Wednesday also reiterated his threat to hold contempt votes within his committee for Barr and Ross if they fail to turn over certain documents on the citizenship question by Thursday.

“Our Committee has a constitutional responsibility to oversee the Census, and we will not relinquish this responsibility because of a coordinated effort to obstruct our investigation by the Trump Administration,” Cummings said in a statement. “If [the documents] are not produced by tomorrow, we will be forced to move forward with holding Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress.”

“These documents are critical to our oversight efforts, and we plan to use them in our interviews of top Administration officials in the coming weeks.”

Cummings first announced Monday that he was scheduling committee votes to hold Ross and Barr in contempt after they failed to comply with congressional subpoenas for documents about the citizenship question.

The announcement came on the heels of new evidence filed last week in a court case challenging the citizenship question's addition to the 2020 census, alleging that a late GOP redistricting strategist played in a role in the question's orchestration and that Trump officials obscured his involvement. The claims undercut the administration's assertion that the question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The Department of Justice sought to refute the claims in a court filing Monday, claiming that Trump officials involved in the question did not lie in their testimony and were unaware of a 2015 study the strategist, Thomas Hofeller, conducted showing that asking about citizenship would help Republicans in redistricting.

But the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the new allegations, said in a court filing late Tuesday that the Justice Department ""does not deny that damning new evidence reveals hyper-partisan and racially discriminatory motives at the root of the citizenship question.""

A federal judge in New York will hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon on whether to impose sanctions on Trump officials in light of the new evidence.

The Supreme Court is also set to issue in the coming weeks its decision on whether the citizenship question will be allowed on the 2020 census."
"Energy Department Plans to Reclassify High-Level Toxic Waste as Low-Level, Angering Environmental Advocates",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Audrey Mcnamara'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/energy-department-plans-to-reclassify-high-level-toxic-waste-as-low-level-angering-environmental-advocates,"The Trump administration’s Department of Energy on Wednesday announced plans to reclassify dangerous, high-level radioactive waste as low-level in a move that has sparked alarm among environmental advocates. The plan would shift authority over toxic waste disposal to the federal government, making it easier to transfer the high-level radioactive waste to new sites. The change would effect more than 100 million gallons of high-level waste currently stored in South Carolina, Washington, and Idaho, allowing it to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas, according to the National Resource Defense Council. The DOE says the move would also save $40 billion in cleanup costs. The reclassification would only occur after a thorough analysis and environmental studies, according to the DOE.

The change was immediately criticized by the NRDC, as well as some government officials in the affected states. Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) and Attorney General Bob Ferguson released a statement condemning the administration’s actions. “The Trump Administration is showing disdain and disregard for state authority with these actions,” the statement read. “The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,” said Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at NRDC, in a statement. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.”"

One weird part of the Trump era (and there are many weird parts) is the rise of Donald Trump the Self-Appointed Elections Expert. In between tweets about the wall, the Mueller Witch Hunt and trade, the president regularly takes to Twitter and talks about why he won in 2016, why the polls are where they are and other topics that the wonks typically obsess over. Here’s his latest:

If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt, I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe Best Ever! If the Corrupt Media was actually fair, I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the Fake News, we’re doing great! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2019

I’m a big believer in leading with the positive and trying to find something good in everything — even this — so let’s start with what the president gets right here. Americans are genuinely happy with the state of the economy and Trump’s performance in that area. According to the latest Economist/YouGov poll, 53 percent of registered voters approve of how the president has been handling the economy, and CBS found that 70 percent of Americans believe the economy is good. Trump’s overall approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s range, so he’s right to identify the economy as one of his biggest strengths.

But things get a bit thornier for the president’s theory after that.

Trump is right that media coverage of him has been negative. A study by Pew Research Center showed that early coverage of his presidency was more negative than coverage of Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton.

But he implies that negative coverage is mostly a product of unfairness or “corruption.” That, to me, seems wrong. If the president wanted the media to cover the economy more often, he could have focused on it more. Instead, he tried to pass a series of unpopular Obamacare repeal-and-replace bills; nominated two Supreme Court justices, one of whom was extremely controversial and had an extended, contentious confirmation fight; passed a traditional Republican tax reform bill; lost the House in the midterm elections; shut the government down over border wall funding; picked fights with protesting NFL players; went through a special investigation; got into trade fights with Canada and Mexico; and characterized white supremacists as “very fine people.”

Reasonable people can make (and have made) the case that the media has a liberal bias. But it’s impossible to look at the events of the last two-plus years and think that the media just decided not to focus on the economy or invent stories that made Trump seem ineffective. If Trump wanted to get more positive coverage for his economic policies, he could probably do so by actually getting started on “Infrastructure Week,” and staying on message about the state of the economy and what he believes to be the impact of his tax cuts.

The specific numbers Trump cite have an odd ring to them, as well. If Trump’s overall approval exactly mirrored his approval rating on the economy, he’d be at +10: Fifty-three percent of registered voters approve of his handling of the economy per YouGov, while 43 percent disapprove, and 53 minus 43 equals 10. But even even if the media only covered the economy, it’s not clear Trump would get to a +10 margin. Only 11 percent of Americans said the economy was the most important issue to them in that same YouGov poll, while most Americans listed primarily non-economic issues as the most important: 50 percent listed abortion, gun control, foreign policy, education, gay rights, terrorism, the environment or immigration as their top issue. If someone disapproved of Trump for cultural reasons, then changing the tone of coverage or shifting to the economy may not be enough to get them aboard the Trump train.

Most significantly, it would be tough for any president to get to a +15 or +25 net-approval rating based on the economy alone. For much of the 20th century, the economy had a strong pull on presidential approval ratings: If the economy was good, people were generally happy with the president; and if the economy was bad, they’d get angry. But that trend broke down during the Obama administration, and neither Obama’s numbers nor Trump’s have closely tracked economic indicators. We’re in an era when the political lines are primarily cultural and demographic. And it’s not clear that some tweaks to media coverage would create a groundswell of support for Trump, without a change in his actual behavior, which would likely cause a massive shift in his polling.

Trump obviously has real political talents and insights — he won a Republican primary and a presidential election. But as his tweet shows, he’d probably be better off if he focused on governing and spent less time trying to beat political analysts at their own game.

‘The rats are abandoning the ship’: Lawmaker says Maduro losing Russian support,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/rats-abandoning-ship-lawmaker-says-maduro-losing-russian-support,"Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro is losing allies as a political crisis in the country remains in a “stalemate,” according to a key Republican lawmaker.

""I don’t want to call them the rats, but the rats are abandoning the ship,” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart told the Washington Examiner.

The Florida Republican was referring to reports that a state-run Russian defense company is withdrawing contractors who have been deployed to Venezuela in recent months. The Russian government and the company have denied the reports, but Diaz-Balart maintained that the evidence is in that Maduro doesn't have the money or political support to govern the country.

“The Russians are backing out because they’re not getting paid,” he said. “That Russian withdrawal is because they don’t see Maduro as viable. They don’t see the regime as viable.”

He offered that assessment days after a report that Rostec has only ""a few dozen"" defense advisers in Venezuela at this point. President Trump later tweeted that “Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela,” which drew a derisive response from Moscow.

""I can’t even imagine from where this information has surfaced that we allegedly ‘informed’ Americans that we were pulling out our specialists from there,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday. “But this raises questions for me about the quality of those advisers who put reports on the table of the U.S. president.”

A preliminary series of talks to end the crisis were scrapped after Juan Guaidó, the top opposition lawmaker whom Trump and other Western democracies have recognized as interim president, refused to negotiate with Maduro. That’s an improvement on past negotiations that saw the regime sow divisions within the opposition, according to Diaz-Balart.

“So I am basically very optimistic,” he said. “Are there things that we can do additionally? I think there are, I think there need to be. I don't want to get into the details [but] the Maduro regime is not consolidating, they’re not in control. It’s just kind of there, holed up.”"
EPA chief accuses New York Times reporters of colluding with Sierra Club,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/epa-chief-accuses-new-york-times-reporters-of-colluding-with-sierra-club,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler escalated a dust-up with the media Monday by accusing New York Times reporters of colluding with a major environmental group by retweeting a ""made-up"" quote of his.

“Makes me wonder if the two reporters for the New York Times were colluding with the Sierra Club,"" Wheeler said Wednesday, addressing the agency's Scientific Advisory Board.

He told the board's members to use ""caution"" and ""to be careful what you read in the media"" after the incident.

The controversy started when EPA slammed a reporter from Yahoo News on Tuesday, saying he made up a quote from a National Press Club address he gave on Monday. The story reported that Wheeler said the news media does a disservice by reporting on global warming.

EPA clarified that what Wheeler said Monday was: ""The media does a disservice to the American public and sound policy-making by not informing the public of the progress this nation has made.""

Wheeler called the Yahoo News story, which he said was then retweeted by two New York Times reporters, ""made up."" The EPA did not identify the specific reporters, but the climate reporters Kendra Pierre-Louis and Lisa Friedman retweeted the tweet in question.

Later, the Sierra Club used the story in a tweet of its own.

DOE offers plan to speed nuclear waste cleanup at SRS,https://www.thestate.com,"['The State', 'Raf Casert', 'John Leicester', 'Associated Press']",,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article231181298.html,"The Savannah River Site near Aiken is home to deadly high-level nuclear waste File photograph

The U.S. Department of Energy is proposing to ship what has long been considered some of the world’s most deadly nuclear waste from South Carolina to burial grounds in the western United States under a plan to reclassify some of the atomic refuse as less dangerous.

According to plans, the energy department would classify some of the Savannah River Site’s high-level waste as low-level waste, a type of atomic refuse that is considered less toxic. That, in turn, would allow the material to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas.

“We want to look at taking the waste stream in South Carolina and reclassifying it and moving it out of state,’’ said Paul Dabbar, the energy department’s undersecretary for science.





As it stands, the country does not have a high-level waste burial ground, meaning SRS must keep the deadly waste at the Aiken area weapons complex indefinitely.

The DOE’s plan for reclassifying and shipping waste from SRS is part of a larger proposal to change the definition of nuclear waste at weapons complexes in other parts of the country. The agency says it has historically considered much of the waste that resulted from Cold War weapons production to be high-level. Now, it will consider how radioactive the material is, the DOE said.

In addition to the Savannah River Site, nuclear weapons sites in Washington and Idaho that also have high level waste could benefit from the department’s plan to change the definition of nuclear waste, the agency said.

The SRS proposal and a companion plan for nuclear sites across the country, released Wednesday, drew immediate criticism from environmental groups, which said the plans are potentially dangerous.





But the Department of Energy says reclassifying some of the high level waste would occur only after a thorough analysis and environmental studies.





Federal records show the agency will look at whether 10,000 gallons of Savannah River Site wastewater should still should be classified as high level waste or downgraded to another category. For now, the DOE said it is only considering the 10,000 gallons for disposal at a licensed faciliity outside South Carolina, records show. The wastewater comes from the Defense Waste Processing Facility, an industrial plant that converts high-level waste into glass in an effort to neutralize its danger.

Reclassifying waste would speed cleanup at the Savannah River Site, the agency said. The 310-square-mile weapons complex has tons of atomic refuse left over from Cold War weapons production. Much of that waste is held in about four-dozen aging tanks, some of which have cracked. A handful of tanks have been emptied, but most still contain waste.

Nuclear waste disposal is a hot button issue in South Carolina, where leaders have expressed frustration with the Department of Energy’s failure to clean up high level atomic refuse through the years.

Gov. Henry McMaster found out about the DOE plan Monday during a phone call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the governor’s office said. McMaster likes what he’s seen so far, spokesman Brian Symmes said.

“If the department’s study and analysis shows that this waste can be safely reclassified and transferred elsewhere, then the governor is in full support of any plan that would reduce risk in South Carolina,’’ Symmes said in an email.





Attorney General Alan Wilson’s office also said he hopes any rules change would result in the removal of radioactive waste from South Carolina.

Critics said redefining high level waste and shipping it to low level waste dumps in the West would only shift the problem from South Carolina to other communities.

Don Hancock, who follows nuclear issues for the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the plan would not go over well with some residents of Texas and Utah. Low-level waste disposal sites were not designed to take highly radioactive material.

Geoff Fettus, who tracks nuclear waste issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said reclassifying waste might also allow officials at SRS to avoid cleaning up some material altogether.





Fettus said that if some of the waste at SRS is no longer considered high level, the DOE could leave the material there and walk away. If that happens, it would not be the first time at SRS. In 2002, the energy department offered plans to reclassify waste so some residual material could remain in the tanks.

“That is the big thing,’’ Fettus said. “I think this is just as much about what stays in the tanks, as to what comes out.’’

Fettus said the environmental group has serious reservations about the plan being advanced by President Donald Trump.





“The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic, radioactive and dangerous waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,’’ Fettus told The State newspaper. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.’’

Tom Clements, who heads Savannah River Site Watch, also said the proposal is unwise and unsafe.





“DOE’s questionable rewriting of the regulations is simply a cost-cutting measure designed to get thousands of HLW (high level waste) containers dumped off site,’’ he said in an email.

Any waste that is reclassified would not be sent to South Carolina’s Barnwell County low-level nuclear waste site near SRS, but to commercial facilities near the Texas-New Mexico border and in Utah, energy officials said. The low-level Utah waste site is owned by the same company that runs the aging Barnwell County low-level waste dump, which has leaked.





“It allows us to dispose of this into facilities ... in Texas or in Utah,’’ Dabbar said.





“We are very excited about actually increasing the pace of reducing risk in South Carolina,’’ he said.

In a news release Wednesday, the DOE said the agency has for decades managed reprocessing waste streams as high level waste, regardless of how radioactive the material is. But it now plans to look at the waste more carefully to determine if some of it is less radioactive. Less dangerous material could be disposed of, according to plans.





“Recognizing this failure, this administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,” Dabbar said in the news release. “DOE is going to analyze each waste stream and manage it in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, with the goal of getting the lower-level waste out of these states without sacrificing public safety.”





The DOE’s proposal to study reclassifying SRS waste and shipping it off-site to low-level waste dumps was released Wednesday but is part of a plan under discussion since last fall. That plan, which drew thousands of public comments, said the DOE would redefine its interpretation of high-level waste. On Wednesday, the agency department said how it would redefine the waste."
Trump wants a starring role on July 4. Jefferson settled for punch and cake.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ronald G. Shafer', 'June At Pm']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/05/trump-wants-starring-role-july-th-jefferson-settled-punch-cake/,"

On the morning of July 4, 1801, a bareheaded President Thomas Jefferson, his “grey locks waving in the air,” watched from the front steps of the White House as crowds celebrated America’s 25th birthday with a military parade, horse races and cockfights. At noon, the president opened the doors to greet guests including ordinary citizens, diplomats, military officers and five Cherokee chiefs.

The Marine Band played in the entrance hall. Inside, about 100 guests were served cakes, wine and punch. “All appeared to be cheerful, all happy. Mr. Jefferson mingled promiscuously with the citizens,” said a woman who attended the event.

In contrast to President Donald Trump’s plans to insert himself into the national celebration in Washington this Fourth of July, early presidents took part in more low-key events. Presidents George Washington and John Adams attended celebrations in various towns around the country. Adams, however, did spark the association of celebrations with the Fourth of July. After Congress approved the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that the date “ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more.”

As the first president to reside in the White House on a July 4, Jefferson started the tradition of holding receptions on Independence Day. President James Madison hosted “heads of departments” one year. In 1825, President John Quincy Adams went to Capitol Hill to hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence before hosting a White House gathering.

In 1841, President John Tyler hosted a dinner that included turtle soup made from a 300-pound turtle from Key West, Fla. “That evening Tyler and his guests walked out onto Lafayette Square to enjoy a fireworks display,” according to the White House Historical Association.

[Jefferson’s powerful last public letter reminds us what Independence Day is all about]

In 1845, President James K. Polk featured fireworks at the White House itself. Unfortunately, the presidential pyrotechnics had a tragic end. Nearly 8,000 people gathered “to witness a most magnificent display of fireworks,” the Washington Union reported. Near the close of the display, 12 rockets were accidentally fired into the crowd. “Mr. James Knowles, a worthy and industrious citizen of Washington, was transfixed through the heart by one and was instantly killed.” A woman, Georgiana Ferguson, also was hit and died the next day.

July 4 was a fateful day for some presidents as well. Both John Adams and Jefferson died on that day in 1826. President James Monroe died on July 4, 1831. Then there was President Zachary Taylor. On a steamy July 4, 1850, “Old Rough and Ready” walked over to ceremonies at the location where the Washington Monument was being built. Later, back at the White House, he gulped down cherries and iced milk. He came down with cholera and died on July 9.

In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln gave what became known as his “Fourth of July” speech from a second-floor window of the White House to a crowd accompanied by a band celebrating the fall of Vicksburg. The date was July 7, but the speech got its name because Lincoln talked about the importance of the Fourth of July to the nation.

President Ulysses S. Grant began a new July 4 tradition for presidents in 1872, according to research by James Heintze, author of “The Fourth of July Encyclopedia.” Grant left town and went to Long Beach, N.J. In 1892, President Benjamin Harrison spent the Fourth in Cape May, N.J. In 1902 President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to Pittsburgh, where he gave a speech to 200,000 people.

In 1909, President William Howard Taft was at his new “summer White House” in Beverly, Mass., when the District of Columbia conducted its first official Independence Day celebration. More than 40,000 people turned out to see daylight and evening fireworks on the Ellipse behind the White House. The celebrations have continued every year since.

President Harry S. Truman is the only president to ever take an active role in the Washington celebration. With more than 150,000 people at the Mall on July 4, 1951, for the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Truman gave a speech from the Washington Monument about progress in the Korean War.

President Richard Nixon videotaped a message that was played on the Mall at July 4 ceremonies in 1970 when bottle-throwing anti-Vietnam War protesters disrupted the event.

In 1976, the nation celebrated its bicentennial year with a record of more than 1 million people jamming onto the Mall. President Gerald Ford watched from the White House after speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

President Ronald Reagan got involved in the 1983 Washington celebration when his Interior Secretary James Watt banned the Beach Boys from singing at festivities on the Mall. Watt said the group would draw “the wrong element.” He replaced the rock group with the family-friendly U.S. Army Blues band and Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton.

President Reagan, at the behest of his wife, Nancy, overturned the ban. Mrs. Reagan said her children grew up listening to the Beach Boys’ music, and the group’s members “are fine, outstanding people.” The group didn’t perform that year, but it did the next before more than half a million people. Lead singer Mike Love drew cheers when he addressed the crowd as “all you undesirable elements.”

President Bill Clinton reviewed Navy ships in New York on July 4, 2000. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama presided over naturalization ceremonies for new U.S. citizens. Last year on July 4, President Trump and his wife, Melania, hosted a White House picnic for military families.

This year President Trump has tweeted about a “Salute To America” that would feature “an address by your favorite President, me.” Trump plans to speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Critics said that would turn the historically nonpartisan celebration into a Trump political rally.

It’s too soon to say how the plans will work out. What does seem certain about this year’s July 4 celebration is that, in more ways than one, there will be fireworks.

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times. She Attended California State University.']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2019/06/05/us-commerce-department-offers-solution-for-obtaining-minerals-critical-to-the-military/,"A report by the U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government strengthen relations with foreign companies that provide minerals critical to military development.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is scheduled to meet with People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang this weekend at a gathering of G-20 finance leaders in Japan, marking the first face-to-face discussion between key U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in nearly a month.

A Treasury spokesman confirmed the meeting along with nine other bilaterals for Mnuchin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering in Fukuoka.

Talks aimed at ending a festering trade war between the world's two largest economies broke down in early May, and no face-to-face meetings have been held since May 10, the day that U.S. President Donald Trump sharply increased tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods to 25%.

Since then, acrimonious rhetoric and trade threats between Beijing and Washington have steadily increased, especially after the United States imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China's premier telecommunications equipment firm.

The Treasury did not offer any other details about the meeting with Yi, who has been a fixture on the Chinese negotiating team led by Vice Premier Liu He. Mnuchin has previously met with Yi on the sidelines of G20 finance meetings to discuss global finance and economic issues.

Mnuchin also will hold bilateral meetings with Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Nam-Ki, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary General Angel Gurria, the Treasury said."

(CNN) In the latest in the slew of controversial and restrictive immigration provisions put in place by the Trump administration, the US State Department announced this week that nonimmigrant visa forms had been updated to require ""most"" visa applicants to provide information about ""their social media handles along with other information"" going back five years. In a diffident statement to The New York Times, the State Department played down the potential impact of the new requirement, saying: ""We already request certain contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants."" The new screening requirements, officials added, were put in place to ""protect US citizens.""

Rafia Zakaria

Both premises, that the demand for social media information is not more intrusive than other existing provisions and that it is required to protect American citizens, are questionable at best.

When applicants fill out a visa application for a nonimmigrant visa to the United States, one of the primary things they must provide is evidence that they do not intend to overstay their visas. Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS 1184(b)) states : ""Every alien ... shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status."" In plain language, this means that in the process of applying for a visa, the presumption is against the applicant, who must prove to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she will not come to the United States and never leave.

Sharing five years of social media posts, likes, retweets and other information is likely to make it even harder for nonimmigrant visa applicants to satisfy the requirements. When considered against the legal requirements, these measures seem designed to provide consular officers more reasons to reject those applying for nonimmigrant visas. This is a particular problem, given the fact that the consular officer has total discretion and those whose applications are denied cannot appeal the decision

Social media posts from three or four or five years ago, ones that say something like, ""I wish I could get away from here,"" or, ""I wish I lived in New York,"" could be construed as evidence of the intent to stay, as could any number of the ambiguous or reactive statements that people routinely make on social media platforms.

Trump’s latest church visit was crass politicization of a house of worship,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Wear', 'June At Pm']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/06/05/presidents-visit-churches-not-like-trump-did/,"

Church visits from a president are complicated affairs, requiring layers of careful thought and planning for the potent mixture of the temporal and the eternal. President Trump is not known for holding fragile things with care, and his drop-in at McLean Bible Church on Sunday proved that yet again, in a significant departure from the approach of his predecessors.

The break with tradition is not that Trump appeared at a church. Church visits by politicians are common on both sides of the aisle, and many Democratic presidential hopefuls have spoken from pulpits in the past few months.

In my book, “Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America,” I describe the significant logistical and atmospheric challenges for a president to attend church. It is inherently disruptive, because he brings the office of the presidency when he attends.

Much attention has been focused on how the church should or could have handled this situation differently, but not enough of that focus has considered the egregious course of action taken by Trump and his staff that forced this situation on the church in the first place.

What was truly outrageous about the president’s visit to McLean are those details that are specific to this president and his staff’s conduct. There we can see a manipulation and crass politicization of a house of worship that is, to my knowledge, without precedent at a national level outside of “House of Cards.”

Platt said in a statement he didn’t know Trump was coming until he had finished his sermon. Apparently, Trump’s staff notified someone at the church that he would be dropping by while en route from the golf course. I cannot overstate how unusual, how deeply disrespectful this course of action is to the local church, the sanctity of worship and the welfare of the church. This was the co-option of worship, the crashing of a service by the apparatus of the presidency.

When we approached a religious leader to discuss plans for any public partnership or involvement I tried to discuss the risks, and never pressured those who did not seem to be prepared or willing to take them. And this is what makes Trump’s appearance at McLean abhorrent to me as a Christian and as someone who has tried to engage religious communities in a way that empowers, not disempowers, them: Trump’s White House, intentionally or not, arranged its visit in a way that drastically limited the agency of the church.

The president, for all the power of his office, should never assume entree to a church stage or pulpit. The doors of the church must always be open, but a church must be given all deference to dictate its service as it sees fit. Trump and his staff know how divisive his presidency is, how much discord it has caused, and they decided to impose that conflict on a congregation. They left the church no opportunity for discernment, prayer and discussion to prepare for such a visit. It is inexcusable.

Trump is a transactional man who believes he has done much for conservative evangelicals. This latest antic provides another glimpse into just what he expects in return.

What a church visit from a president looks like

Church visits from presidents generally require multiple security and planning meetings, including many conversations with church staff. Presidential visits to St. John’s Church, which is across from the White House, became less intensive during both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations because they attended multiple times and the church has protocol in place for such visits. I can speak definitively for the Obama presidency, and with significant familiarity with previous presidencies, that the pastor of any church a president would visit was expecting it and had time to prepare for that visit.

Presidential church visits can be burdensome on the church, as they often require security measures such as screening of all attendees. The president’s presence can be a distraction to the congregation’s worship, and attention from the congregation can be a distraction to the president’s worship. Then-president-elect, Obama planned to attend a historically black church weeks before his inauguration. But word leaked the previous evening, so tourists turned out and displaced much of the church membership.

The first family would sometimes have tourists’ cameras flashing in their eyes as they walked down the aisle to receive the Eucharist. The challenges can be worth it if the president desires to worship in a church, and churches are typically honored to host a president regardless of their politics, but the apparatus of the presidency is not without its burdens when it comes to attending church.

And, of course, church visits are often on politicians’ political calendars, not their personal ones. Even if attendance is driven by personal devotion, presidents and their staff can never forget that any move they make has implications. Churches and pastors must always be cognizant of those professional implications, as well. Even the most earnest president understands that there are political opportunities and costs associated with attending church. The church’s pastor, history and beliefs are often subject to press and unfriendly political interest.

Religious forums are often twisted for partisan gain. This is strikingly apparent in evangelist Franklin Graham’s call for a day of prayer to support the president this past Sunday, which happened to coincide with Trump’s visit to McLean Bible Church. As Michael Gerson wrote for The Washington Post, “Graham made clear that the real purpose of the event was not to pray for the president, but to pray in his political favor.” Graham’s call amounts to the utilitarian appropriation of prayer for partisan ends. Those ends were intentionally obfuscated to achieve their purpose of placing a religious veneer on what was an electoral effort.

This is not to say that prayer should ever be separated from a Christian’s politics. The Christians who prayed for an end to slavery were right to do so, and I believe their prayers honored God. I believe Christians need to be praying more about politics, not less. But prayer in politics, like all prayers, must be put under the will of God and divine intentions. Prayer should never be a cover for political mobilization or manipulation.

Politically or religiously convenient engagement

There are scripture-based arguments for and against hosting political figures at churches, and I believe both sides have merit. What is interesting is how the same people will invoke different arguments when they are politically convenient.

Many of the same people invoking biblical admonitions to pray for Trump argued during Obama’s terms that giving special attention to the president amounted to complicity with evil or undue esteem for political officeholders. Many of the same people who are calling today for pastors and Christian speakers to unload their disagreements and anger with the president in his presence viewed similar behavior as unprecedented disrespect when it happened during Obama’s time. This is why criticisms of Trump appearing at a church are so easily dismissed by the political right, and why explanations for why a church might host Trump are so easily dismissed by the left.

Churches that welcome political leaders should do so with the intention to share the gospel and uphold the biblical ideas of righteousness and justice, while understanding that politicians’ motivations do not always align with those intentions. Churches who reject entreaties from politicians should be careful about applying such prohibitions without a clear and consistent standard.

There will always be room in the Christian tradition for different approaches to the engagement of political leaders and issues. The line we must defend: Those decisions are ours to make, not subject to the whims and interests of politicians like Trump, who view all forums as a potential venue for their self-aggrandizement.

"DOJ: Carnival Re-Polluted, Then Tried to 'Drown Its Deceit'",http://www.newser.com,['Jenn Gidman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,http://www.newser.com/story/276105/doj-carnival-re-polluted-then-tried-to-drown-its-deceit.html,"(Newser) – Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice—still shame on you, and you're going to pay big for it. That's essentially the Justice Department's message to Carnival Corporation, which just got busted, again, for its ships polluting the waters they sail in, and for trying to cover it all up, the New York Times reports. The company's Princess Cruises had already been convicted and sentenced in April 2017 on felony charges related to one of its ships dumping oil-contaminated waste, and staff then trying to conceal those actions, per a DOJ statement. For those infractions, Princess had to pony up $40 million and was placed on ""environmental probation."" Now an additional $20 million penalty against Carnival and Princess has been tacked on, with six probation violations noted, including dumping plastic into Bahamian waters from the Carnival Elation.

Other violations cited in the court filing Monday include falsifying environmental training records on two cruise ships, as well as interfering with court-supervised inspections. ""A corporation is responsible to its shareholders and board of directors to be profitable, but not by breaking the law and destroying the very environment in which it navigates for profit,"" says US Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. ""Carnival's failure to comply with the terms of its probation and later, its attempt to drown its deceit goes against the fiber of corporate compliance."" Per the Miami Herald, via the Times, Carnival's CEO, Arnold Donald, said at a Monday hearing, ""I do take responsibility for the problems we have. I am extremely disappointed that we've had them."" He pledged that the company is ""fully committed"" to resolving these issues. (Read more Carnival Cruise Lines stories.)

"Democrats grill FBI, DHS officials on white supremacy threat",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-grill-trump-administration-officials-white-supremacy-threat/story?id=63478001,"House Democrats grilled officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in a Tuesday hearing focused on how the Trump administration is addressing the growing threat of violent white supremacist extremists.

The House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties hearing, titled 'Confronting White Supremacy: Adequacy of the Federal Response,' was the latest effort by Democrats to spotlight ways they say the Trump administration has systematically cut back on resources used to address threats from domestic extremists even as the FBI has reported a 30-40% rise in domestic terrorism cases just since October.

Federal officials in attendance at Tuesday's hearing included FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Criminal Investigations Calvin Shivers and DHS Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann.

Committee chairman Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., opened the hearing by raising issue with the amount of resources he says the FBI devotes towards investigating cases of international terrorism versus domestic terrorism.

Citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League, Raskin noted that from 2009-2018, far-right extremism was responsible for 73% of extremist murders, while international terrorism was responsible for 23% of terrorism deaths.

""The FBI has testified the bureau allocates its resources almost exactly backwards than the problem would suggest,"" Raskin said. ""Devoting 80% of field agents to stopping international terrorism including Islamic extremism and only 20% to stopping domestic terrorism including far right and white supremacist extremism.""

But McGarrity pointed to the success that FBI agents have so far had in disrupting potential domestic attacks in the past several months, and said successful arrests prior to domestic attacks actually outnumbered those arrested prior to attacks in international terror cases.

""In fiscal year 2018 FBI (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) across the country proactively arrested approximately 115 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations before they could mobilize into violence,"" McGarrity said. ""So far (since Oct. 1 of last year), our JTTFs have disrupted approximately 66 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations by arrest.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., pressed Neumann on a report that the department recently disbanded and slashed funding for a section of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which focused on producing reports on domestic terrorism and which Democrats warn could result in a reduction of available data on threats from white supremacist groups.

Neumann countered that the funding dedicated to the department was only inflated due to millions in grant funding committed during the Obama administration, but later in the hearing gave a candid assessment regarding DHS' overall counterterrorism strategy, saying that the administration is actively working to find ways to improve its prevention strategy.

""We know we're not doing enough,"" Neumann said. ""Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, we have to institutionalize it, you either need to authorize it through Congress or you need to get it in executive order or national security presidential memoranda.""

House Homeland Security Committee, FILE

Following the terror attack on several mosques in New Zealand in March carried out by an alleged white supremacist, President Donald Trump told reporters he didn't see white nationalism as a rising threat to the U.S.

The hearing followed a briefing just two weeks earlier from a senior FBI counterterrorism official who gave sobering statistics to reporters regarding the domestic threat environment.

The official revealed the FBI currently has a total of just under 5,000 open terrorism cases, including 850 domestic terror-related cases, and acknowledged that far more Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks than Islamic terror attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

According to the official, a significant issue that the bureau faces is that the federal criminal code has made it more challenging to bring charges against domestic terror suspects than in cases involving international terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations.

That's because, according to the FBI Agents Association, ""domestic terrorism"" itself is not a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is about political violence,"" Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement to ABC News. ""Congress must do everything in its power to provide law enforcement with the tools needed to combat this threat to our country.""

Investigators often are forced to rely on other federal crimes to charge suspects with or rely on state or local laws, such as in the recent case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who despite being accused in court of plotting mass murder ""on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" is currently facing only gun and drug charges from U.S. attorneys in Maryland.

And while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially described the Charlottesville, Virginia attack by James Fields Jr., which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, as ""the definition of domestic terrorism,"" Fields in March pleaded guilty to 29 counts of violating federal hate crime law.

The issue surfaced in a contentious exchange between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and McGarrity, where McGarrity was pressed on why the 2015 Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and last year's Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh were treated as ""hate crime incidents"" rather than acts of domestic terrorism.

""That's not correct,"" McGarrity said, pointing out that while the attacks are considered instances of domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice, ""there's no domestic terrorism charge.""

In an emotional exchange on the subject later in the hearing, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, read a death threat letter sent to her and fellow Muslim congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar that cited the New Zealand mosque attacks and remarked, ""the only good Muslim is a dead one.""

""How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?"" Tlaib said through tears. ""How come we don't have enough tools right now to pull these people in?""

McGarrity expressed sympathy for Tlaib and urged her to bring her concerns directly to the Department of Justice, after earlier noting he personally would welcome Congress passing a law that makes domestic terrorism a federal crime.

“I will say as a former prosecutor and as a former investigator, I want every tool in the tool box,” McGarrity said."
Prosecutors: Florida Veteran Planted Bomb at VA Hospital,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Pilar Melendez'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/florida-veteran-planted-bomb-at-va-hospital-prosecutors,"A Florida Army veteran is accused of planting an improvised explosive device (IED) at a Veterans Affairs hospital last month, federal authorities said Wednesday. Mark Edward Allen, 60, is charged with possession of unregistered explosive devices after allegedly leaving an IED at a Veterans Affairs hospital near St. Petersburg on May 29, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida. Prosecutors also said two days after the hospital IED was found, and rendered safe, another IED was discovered in Allen’s home by his wife. She called the authorities to report the homemade bomb after loading the device into her car and bringing it to a friend’s house “because she was scared,” according to the complaint. Allen is currently being held at the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. If convicted, the veteran faces up to 10 years in prison."
Mallinckrodt hit with new kickback charges same day as $15.4M settlement with the feds,https://www.fiercepharma.com,['Kyle Blankenship'],,,,https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/mallinckrodt-hit-new-kickback-charges-one-day-after-15-5m-settlement-feds,"Chafing under federal kickback charges tied to controversial gel H.P. Acthar, Mallinckrodt appeared to be out of the woods with a settlement in the works. Turns out it was out of the frying pan and into the fire.

The DOJ filed new charges Wednesday against Mallinckrodt, which acquired Acthar-maker Questcor Pharma in 2014, accusing the company of funneling money through front funds to illegally subsidize Medicare copays and jack up the drug’s list price 85,000%. The newest charges filed in Pittsburgh federal court come the same day as the drugmaker and the federal government agreed in principle to a $15.4 million settlement on separate charges tied to two whistleblower kickback suits the DOJ joined in early May.

Mallinckrodt called the settlement “fair and reasonable” in a statement and vowed to fight the new federal charges.

“As we have said repeatedly, where we can resolve legacy legal matters in a reasonable and manageable way, we will do so,"" Mark Casey , Mallinckrodt’s general counsel, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, that has not been possible to date regarding the allegations relating to Questcor's charitable foundation activities, despite what we believe was lawful and appropriate activity.”

In their suit, federal prosecutors accused Mallinckrodt, through Questcor, of using three funds to illegally subsidize Medicare patient copays for Acthar while hiking the price of the drug from $50 to $32,000 per vial. In doing so, the DOJ alleged the company defrauded the federal government of millions of dollars through false Medicare claims and induced doctors to boost prescriptions of the drug.

“The subsidies it routed through these funds drove Acthar prescribing and was a proven method that negated concerns about the cost of the drug, allowing (Mallinckrodt) to continually raise its price,” prosecutors said.

RELATED: More trouble for Mallinckrodt: DOJ joins the fray in Acthar whistleblower suits

The newest charges are only the latest knocks in Mallinckrodt’s troubled history with Acthar, with appeared to reach its nadir when the DOJ joined two whistleblower suits against the company in May.

Prosecutors said Questcor ran a “high-tiered strategy” to pay doctors to boost scripts for Acthar while using “dirty data” to mislead payers on the drug’s safety and usefulness. Whistleblowers said the company intimidated and fired employees who called its marketing strategy into question, using sham internal investigations to cover up illegal activity.

In its proposed settlement with the feds, Mallinckrodt did not admit any wrongdoing in the scheme, which allegedly took place prior to the Questcor’s acquisition. Mallinckrodt has argued that Acthar’s astronomical price increases took place prior to the Questcor buyout, although the company has instituted routine price hikes since acquiring the drug.

Those price hikes were the target of a separate federal probe that Mallinckrodt settled for $100 million in 2017 alleging Questcor bought and shelved an Acthar competitor in order to gouge the drug’s list price. The Federal Trade Commission investigation focused on Questcor’s 2013 acquisition of Synacthen Depot, a rival drug that regulators said was put aside in favor of development that didn’t compete with Acthar.

USDA calls Indiana farm workers' actions 'unacceptable',https://www.theindychannel.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/usda-calls-indiana-farm-workers-actions-unacceptable,"FAIR OAKS, Ind. — The Indiana State Board of Animal Health is working with law enforcement concerning allegations of animal abuse and mistreatment at Fair Oaks Farms in northwest Indiana.

Indiana State Veterinarian Bret D. Marsh has directed the Board of Animal Health (BOAH) staff to collaborate with local law enforcement regarding any appropriate next steps they may take, said spokeswoman Denise Derrer.

The Newton County Sheriff's Office has opened an investigation after the Animal Recovery Mission, a Florida-based animal welfare group, released undercover footage gathered between August and November 2018 after one of their investigators was hired as a calf care employee at the Fair Oaks Farms Prairies Edge North Barn.

The undercover video captured employees throwing calves in and out of their huts, calves kicked and slammed to the ground, a worker sitting on top of a calf.

The state was not made aware of the video or abuse allegations until June 4, said Derrer.

“No representative of ARM has contacted BOAH to report their concerns and findings or share video images they gathered,” said Derrer. “After watching the video, BOAH officials reviewed compliance records and complaint logs for Fair Oaks Farms. No reports of animal abuse or neglect have been filed with the agency since the farms’ founding in the mid-1990s.”

RTV6 also checked with the United States Department of Agriculture, which deferred to Indiana and local agencies.

“The actions depicted on the Animal Recovery Mission video are unacceptable,” read a USDA statement to RTV6. “USDA has full confidence that Indiana state and local authorities will investigate this particular case and take appropriate action.”

The USDA statement said Fair Oaks Farms is not a federally inspected slaughter facility, and therefore is not within USDA’s regulatory authority.

“However, any allegations of animal cruelty must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated by the proper authorities to ensure all animals are treated with care and dignity,” read the USDA statement.

USDA's authority to regulate the treatment of animals includes the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act protects animals when they are presented for slaughter at federally inspected establishments, according to the agency.

The Animal Welfare Act allows the USDA to ensure the proper care of live animals when used in biomedical research, testing, and exhibition.

“Policies for humane handling of animals consist of a combined effort of federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private industry,” read the statement. “When animals fall within our authorities, USDA acts to prevent animal cruelty such as this. The animals depicted in this video do not fall within our authority.”

PREVIOUS STORY | Undercover video shows animal cruelty at Fair Oaks Farms, founder admits

Fair Oaks Farms founder Mike McCloskey provided the following statement to RTV6 Tuesday in which he called the employees’ actions “despicable.”

“This morning I was made aware of an animal abuse video that the group Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) produced and has released to the public and the press. Most of the footage for this video was captured on one of the dairies that belongs to Fair Oaks Farms. While we were made aware a couple months ago of the fact that ARM had gone undercover at Fair Oaks Farms, and had proactively made a statement ( link ), we had no idea what kind of footage had been captured or what – if any – abuse had occurred.

It is with great disappointment to find, after closely reviewing the released ARM video, that there were five individuals committing multiple instances of animal cruelty and despicable judgement. Of the five, four were our employees and one was a 3rd party truck driver who was picking up calves. Of the four who were our employees, three had already been terminated prior to us being made aware months ago of the undercover ARM operation, as they were identified by their co-workers as being abusive of our animals and reported to management. So, in this instance our policy of cow care training - “see something, say something” - worked. After reviewing the video frame-by-frame, those three employees are responsible for the overwhelming majority of offenses seen in this video.

Unfortunately, the fourth employee’s animal abuse was not caught at that same time. Although he underwent another training session in animal care when we discovered there was an undercover ARM operation on our farm, after viewing the extent of his animal abuse, he is being terminated today.

As to the individual who worked for the transportation company, today, we will notify the company that he works for and he will not be allowed on our farms again. It is our position that any companies that come in contact with transportation of our animals, should be well-versed in and adhere to our industry’s animal welfare practices which can be found in FARM ( https://nationaldairyfarm.com [nationaldairyfarm.com ).

Months ago, when I first learned of the undercover activity, I requested a 3rd party review and we went through a re-training process throughout the dairies. While the review came back favorable, I am not letting my guard down and will institute more thorough monitoring and training so that this abuse can never happen again. This video and any future videos will be immediately handed over to the authorities for review and potential prosecution.

Regardless, I am disgusted by and take full responsibility for the actions seen in the footage, as it goes against everything that we stand for in regards to responsible cow care and comfort. The employees featured in the video exercised a complete and total disregard for the documented training that all employees go through to ensure the comfort, safety and well-being of our animals.

It is a shock and an eye-opener for us to discover that under our watch, we had employees who showed disregard for our animals, our processes and for the rule of law. This ARM video shines a light on an area that – despite our thorough training, employee onboarding procedures and overall commitment to animal welfare – needs improvement. However, as I have stated before, the fact that ARM takes months before notifying owners or authorities regarding on-going animal abuse is concerning. I have personally reached out to ARM’s founder, Richard Kudo, to discuss a more symbiotic relationship but he has yet to reach back.

A full investigation of all aspects of the video is underway, during and after which disciplinary action will be taken, including termination and criminal prosecution, of any and all employees and managers who have violated either our animal care practices or the law or both.

The statement that we grow and sell drugs on our farms is false. The plants featured in the video are an invasive perennial species that is rampant on farms all over the Midwest. With that said, I am disappointed to learn of potential drug use on our properties. Months ago, the individual seen smoking by the barn and doing drugs in a truck was turned in by his co-workers to one of our managers. That manager notified local law enforcement about the drug use and, accordingly, a police report is on file.

It is with a heavy heart that I prepare this statement today. As a veterinarian whose life and work is dedicated to the care, comfort and safety of all animals, this has affected me deeply. I am disappointed for not being aware of this kind of awful treatment occurring and I take full responsibility for what has happened. I also take full responsibility to correct and ensure that every employee understands, embraces and practices the core values on which our organization stands.

I am and will continue to be deeply involved in the resolution of this matter, down to every one of our employees, so that I can guarantee that these actions never again occur on any of our farms.”

The Newton County sheriff said his office has requested the names and identifiers of those terminated for animal cruelty by Fair Oaks Dairy Farms.

Fairlife released a statement Thursday night regarding Fair Oaks Farms and said it is immediately suspending milk deliveries from the dairy."

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

In 2020, at least one of the two major-party nominees is going to be the oldest in U.S. history, since Donald Trump, at 74, will be a record-setter (beating out Ronald Reagan ’84, Bob Dole ’96 and John McCain ’08). There’s a decent chance, however, that the 2020 contest will feature the two oldest nominees ever, if one of the two current Democratic front runners, Joe Biden (who will be 77 on Election Day) or Bernie Sanders (who will be 79) is nominated in Milwaukee next July.

Age hasn’t been a big issue in discussions of any of these esteemed gentlemen so far. Trump is so unusual in so many ways that his calendar age seems almost incidental. Sanders’s strong youth following has probably insulated him from some age-related inquiries. And it’s unclear whether voters really know how old any of these people are in the first place. But given the evidence that some voters are concerned about age, you have to figure some of Biden’s and Sanders’s Democratic rivals might find ways to hint at it (e.g., lots of talk about a “new generation” of leadership, or “fresh thinking,” etc.). An incident that suggests an age-related disability could raise eyebrows and fears, as it did for Dole and for Hillary Clinton.

The age of 2020 candidates may help create the impression that there is an upward trend in the age of presidents (or would-be presidents), which would make sense given steadily increasing life expectancies over the decades and centuries. And indeed, two of the three septuagenarian presidents, Reagan and Trump, were in office in the last 40 years. (Eisenhower, who at the end of his presidency was very briefly as old as Trump was when he began his, is the third.)

But actually, if you separate the 45 presidents into three chronological groups of 15, you get a surprise: The oldest is the first group of 15 presidents, from Washington through Buchanan (1789–1861), which averaged 57.1 years of age upon inauguration. The last 15, from Hoover through Trump (1929–present) averaged 56.3 years of age upon inauguration. (In case you were wondering, the middle group, from Lincoln through Coolidge, was by far the most youthful, averaging 51.6 years at inauguration, with nary a one taking office over 60).

What’s really changed is the relationship of presidential age to that of the relevant (for everyone other than Barack Obama) white male population. Statistics are spotty for the early years of the republic, and relatively high infant-mortality rates skew them, but average age expectancy at the turn of the 19th century was around 40. It was under 45 when William Henry Harrison took office at the age of 68 in 1840. It didn’t hit 50 until the early years of the 20th century. It passed 60 in the 1930s, and 70 around 1980. So most recent presidents were not as old compared to the voters who chose them. Today Bernie Sanders’s age is right at the life expectancy of white men. Compared to those early presidents, he and Biden really don’t stand out.

But just because Americans are living longer doesn’t necessarily mean they are immune from physical and cognitive decline, and that’s the real reason there might be some practical ceiling on presidential age, as I discussed in an earlier piece on the subject of presidential candidates who would turn 80 during their first term:

There are certainly octogenarians who are physically fit, sharp as a tack, and as competent at work as any whippersnapper. But it’s no secret that when people, particularly men, get to that age, the risk of mortality rises significantly (a 75-year-old man has a 22 percent chance of dying within six years), and along with it the possibility of cognitive deterioration (an estimated 15 percent of people between the ages of 80 and 84 suffer from some form of dementia). If voters fear any of that happening, it could (particularly with some encouragement from the kind of intensely hostile conservative media that Sanders and Biden were spared in 2016) affect their electability in ways that are not easy to anticipate in scope and power. And even more obviously, if a 77- or 79-year-old candidate suffers from any real or perceived impairment, the issue could take over the campaign to an extent that makes Hillary Clinton’s email problem look minor.

So from a historical perspective, Trump, Sanders, and Biden (and Elizabeth Warren, who will become a septuagenarian later this month) aren’t too old at all as compared to the rest of the population. From a health point of view, it’s hard to say if they are riskier propositions than younger pols. There is the cautionary tale of Reagan, whom many observers thought was showing signs of serious cognitive impairment during his second term. On the other hand, another president who was clearly impaired, Woodrow Wilson, was only 62 when he suffered a debilitating stroke, and three presidents (excluding those who were assassinated) never made it out of their 50s (and a fourth, the physically vigorous Teddy Roosevelt, barely did). So it’s always going to be a matter of individual capacities and health conditions.

If older-than-ever presidents really do become the wave of the future, it does suggest that the current trend of taking vice-presidential nominations seriously — and not simply awarding them to achieve ideological or geographic balance — is a good idea. “Accidental” presidents John Tyler and Andrew Johnson were calamities for their party and (arguably) their country, and Chet Arthur might have been had he not liberated himself from the political bosses who had owned him. The decision of Democratic leaders to substitute Harry Truman for Henry Wallace as veep in 1944 based on their justified fears about FDR’s health had enormous consequences. If the Donkey Party does nominate a 2020 presidential candidate who would require a raging fire of birthday candles, the second spot on the ticket should be occupied by someone who is more than a ticket-balancer. And if one of them wins and thrives, we can begin thinking about a “ceiling” for candidates that’s even higher."
Trump's latest Interior pick wins unexpected support from environmentalists,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447105-trumps-latest-interior-pick-wins-support-of-some-environmentalists,"President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Pelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Warren invokes Obama, Trump when asked about electability MORE’s most recent Interior Department nominee is garnering support from an unexpected group: environmentalists.

Robert Wallace, nominated to help oversee the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service (NPS), is bucking the trend of opposition from green groups, even though he ticks several boxes that would otherwise draw a strong rebuke from environmentalists: He’s a Trump appointee, earns thousands of dollars from stock in the oil industry and spent nearly two decades as a lobbyist for General Electric Energy.

Wallace currently works as president of the Upper Green River Conservancy and as a partner at the investment firm i2Capital.

The Wyoming native testified this week before the two Senate committees that oversee Interior.

In addition to words of praise from Republicans and some Democrats, several environmental groups said they plan to endorse Wallace, citing his background and their experience working with him. His work on protecting habitat for the sage-grouse also seems to have won over a number of green groups.

The National Park Conservation Association (NPCA), Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Refuge Association all have or will endorse Wallace. Other groups are staying silent instead of opposing his nomination.

“In NPCA’s experience, Wallace understands the many diverse opinions surrounding national parks and has shown his commitment to inclusive community-based dialogue and solutions,” the association wrote in a letter to senators. “He has been a dedicated participant and leader in public lands and wildlife management and most recently has demonstrated his ability to bring diverse stakeholders together to preserve sage grouse habitat in Wyoming.”

In confirmed, Wallace would be the first assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks since 2011.

Before his career as a lobbyist, Wallace worked for the National Park Service, both as a park ranger right out of college and later as a congressional liaison for NPS during the Reagan administration. He also worked as chief of staff for former Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and later as the Republican director of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

In both hearings, Wallace stressed his willingness to work in a bipartisan manner and improve the contentious relationship between the government and partners at the state, tribal, and local level who have a strong interest in federal land management.

“Partner is an easy word to say, but a hard word to implement,” he told senators Wednesday. “The federal government always shows up as the alpha, and that’s a model I will work to better equalize.”

Green groups have largely been at odds with Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency since Trump took office, flagging ethical issues among the top brass and bemoaning the number of former lobbyists employed at the agencies.

And not all environmental groups have high praise for Wallace.

“Just when you thought the Trump administration couldn’t possibly fill the swamp with any more lobbyists, they nominate another one whose former employer has business before Interior,"" Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project, said in a statement. ""Following in ex-mega lobbyist turned-Interior Secretary [David] Bernhardt’s footsteps, Wallace would immediately be in a position to influence decisions that could benefit the special interests he used to work for.”

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have yet to schedule votes on Wallace's nomination."

The Trump administration’s new immigration enforcement chief said Tuesday that he is preparing to increase arrests and deportations of migrant families living illegally in the U.S. interior, promising the kind of more aggressive approach the White House has been seeking.

Mark Morgan, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told reporters that his agency is preparing to move forward with a plan — stalled under his predecessor — that will target thousands of families that have disobeyed court orders to leave the country.

“Our next challenge is going to be interior enforcement,” Morgan said. “We will be going after individuals who have gone through due process and who have received final orders of deportation.

“That will include families,” Morgan said, adding that ICE agents will deport them “with compassion and humanity.”

[Before Trump’s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass family arrests]

ICE officials familiar with the plans, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said the agency does not have an imminent operation planned. But the officials said that Morgan is eager to move forward and that preparations are underway.

Morgan, a former FBI official and Border Patrol chief who impressed Trump through tough-talking media appearances, was hired to lead ICE at a time when the president has been repeatedly angered and dismayed at the government’s inability to stem record numbers of illegal crossings by Central American families.

The Trump administration formulated a plan this year to deter those families through increased arrests and deportations. The Justice Department fast-tracked their cases to obtain thousands of removal orders — many of which were issued when parents failed to appear in court — then referred the families to ICE for arrest and deportation.

ICE drew up a strategy for carrying out those orders in 10 large U.S. cities, but then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and former acting ICE director Ronald Vitiello balked, wanting more preparation.

The move frustrated senior Trump immigration adviser Stephen Miller. Nielsen and Vitiello were then ousted in April.

Speaking to reporters at ICE headquarters in Washington on Tuesday, Morgan said the lack of interior enforcement against families has itself become a “pull factor” for unauthorized migration, especially as smuggling guides spread word in Central America that the best way to avoid deportation from the United States is to travel with a child.

More than 100,000 unauthorized migrants have crossed the border in each of the past three months, and U.S. border agents are now detaining an average of 4,500 people per day, the highest level in more than a decade. More than 60 percent of those who are taken into custody are families or underage minors, a record portion.

If migrants state a fear of returning to their home countries, they cannot be swiftly deported, and U.S. courts have set 20 days as the maximum time a child can be held in immigration detention. As a result, the overwhelming majority of families who cross the border are briefly held, released and told to appear at a court date well in the future, giving them a chance to live and work in the United States for years while their claims are processed.

And if their asylum petitions are denied, the chance that those parents and children will be tracked down and arrested remains relatively low.

According to Homeland Security officials, 98 percent of the parents and children who crossed the Mexico border without authorization in 2017 remain in the United States, including thousands ordered deported after skipping out on asylum hearings and court appointments.

Conducting at-large arrests of families with children in major U.S. cities would be a sensitive operation for ICE agents, especially after the Trump administration’s failed “zero tolerance” push last year that separated at least 2,700 children from their parents.

Morgan said his agency’s job is to enforce judicial orders and to uphold the law, not to make decisions about who deserves to stay or who should face deportation.

“If Congress sees the laws as something that is not adequate or appropriate, then Congress should change those laws,” he said.

Morgan, who started in his role last week, also has warned that ICE investigators are detecting a growing number of children arriving with adults who are not their biological parents. The agency has started a pilot program to administer DNA tests when authorities suspect an adult is falsely claiming parentage.

Among the 1,126 families investigated since mid-April, agents determined 206 of them had made false claims, Morgan said. ICE referred 399 cases to prosecutors, and 315 of those were accepted, according to the agency’s latest data.

ICE officials said they could not provide data on the number of those claims that involved children traveling with an unrelated adult or those arriving with relatives such as uncles, stepparents or other caregivers who are known to the children but are not a biological parent."
"DOJ doesn't need to provide transcript of key Flynn phone call after all, judge rules",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-doesnt-need-to-provide-transcript-of-key-flynn-phone-call-after-all-judge-rules,"A federal judge said Tuesday that the Department of Justice no longer has to publicly file a transcript of a fateful phone call between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States, an abrupt and unexplained reversal from his previous order last month

The development comes as Republicans allege that a separate court-ordered transcript release in the case showed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report contained a conspicuously -- and allegedly deceptive -- edited version of a voicemail message from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn's lawyer, Rob Kelner.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had previously directed prosecutors to release details of a December 2016 call in which Flynn discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian envoy to Washington.

EX-TRUMP LAWYER SLAMS MUELLER REPORT AS 'FRAUD,' CITES MISLEADING QUOTE

Sullivan had also given government attorneys until May 31 to produce redacted portions of Mueller's report that relate to Flynn as well as a transcript of a phone message a lawyer for Trump left for Flynn's attorney after Flynn had decided to start cooperating with prosecutors.

On Friday, prosecutors publicly filed the transcript of the call between the lawyers and said all of the information in the report that Flynn had provided had been unredacted. But they declined to produce a transcript of Flynn's call with Kislyak, saying they were not relying on that conversation to establish his guilt or to determine his sentence.

In a brief written order Tuesday, Sullivan said that ""upon consideration of the government's submissions in response to those orders, the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket."" He did not elaborate on why he had changed his mind, and apparently left open the possibility he might order the documents to be produced under seal in the future.

Flynn is awaiting sentencing before Sullivan after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak. He was supposed to be sentenced in December, but midway through the hearing, took the judge up on his offer to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating with prosecutors and earn credit toward a lighter sentence.

MUELLER REPORT REVEALS FLYNN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FAR EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED

Meanwhile, Republicans have focused renewed attention on the transcript that was released Friday. Dowd, Trump's ex-lawyer, left the voicemail message for Kelner after Flynn exited a joint-defense agreement and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Mueller's team analyzed the message as part of their inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice.

According to the Mueller report, Dowd said: ""I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms ... [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with ... the government ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue ... so, you know ... we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can ... [R]emember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.""

But the full transcript revealed Dowd made clear he was not seeking confidential information -- and raised questions as to why Mueller would have omitted apparently exculpatory information. The transcript excerpt in the Mueller report attracted substantial press attention at the time.

The full quote reads, with emphasis added: ""Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-‘m-I’m sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know … some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for the release of “all backup and source information” for the Mueller report on Friday following the revelation of the edited transcript, and Dowd told Fox News the Mueller report was a ""fraud.""

Former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Monday night that the quotation was ""distorted.""

""This is a very, very serious issue,"" he said. ""The distortion of the Dowd quote is very serious. Especially since, remember, that a report by a special counsel is always going to be one-sided. Therefore, you have to trust it.""

DOJ May Investigate Google Again Over Antitrust Issues,https://www.seroundtable.com,['Barry Schwartz'],,,,https://www.seroundtable.com/doj-google-antitrust-issues-27679.html,"The Wall Street Journal reported (WP link) that the Department of Justice may open up an antitrust probe against Google again.

Let me directly upfront that I know very little about legal issues, little about the DOJ and government politics and law. I know when I watch congressional or senate questioning about a topic I know about, it shows how little our government reps know about the topic.

I know Google won a previous antitrust case years ago. But this case, if it is happening, is unclear:

The exact focus of the Justice Department’s investigation is unclear. The department began work on the matter after brokering an agreement with the government’s other antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to take the lead on antitrust oversight of Google, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.

The folks at WebmasterWorld are saying some fun things:

We'll have to wait and see what happens. In the past these things have ""started"" and never gone anywhere.

I am sure that ""Alphabet"" anticipated this since a very long time, and is prepared ... so that, at the end nothing will really change happy!

Its about freakin time. Obviously I’m not the only who who’s been writing letters!

Looks like FTC, Justice, and Congress are all taking up investigations. Google (Alphabet, Search, Ad biz, YouTube), Facebook, Amazon ... all are up for investigation(s).

The icing on the cake is Google's restraint of trade - not allowing websites to link to each other. I'll make damn sure the DOJ knows about that little infraction.

Greg Sterling who is way smarter than me wrote it up at Search Engine Land earlier this week. Also Rand Fishkin wrote up his thoughts at Sparktoro. Rand also posted this stream of thoughts on Twitter:

First, the argument/case being made is NOT: ""Google has a monopoly in search and that's wrong/unfair"".

The DOJ (and concerned citizens) are arguing: ""Google used its monopoly in search to give themselves unfair advantages in other businesses"".

These are the types of questions that show use of monopoly power in one business/field to unfairly compete in others. That's where the issues are, and that's where I'll focus my post.

I honestly have no real thoughts on this. When it comes to politics, taxes, and governments - I personally find I rather spend my time working on stuff I can make a real impact with. So I spend the time and energy on other things than that topic. I just have zero interest in these topics - I know, I am weird.

If some law comes out where Google needs to make changes, then I'd cover that and what it means to the SEO community. I think we have some time for that...

The small evangelical school is alleged to have violated a federal ban on incentive-based compensation by paying a recruiting company “in part with a share of the tuition that ORU received from the enrollment of recruited students,” according to a Justice Department press release.

Maurice Shoe, co-owner of Joined Inc., filed the lawsuit under federal whistleblower provisions in the law that allow private parties to sue on behalf of the government for false claims and receive some of the money recovered. Shoe will receive about $45,000 from the settlement.

ORU admits no wrongdoing in the settlement and denied the allegations.

“The allegations in Shoe’s complaint are without factual or legal merit,” the university said in a statement. “ORU assures its students, faculty, staff, alumni, stakeholders, and the public that at no time did it submit a 'false claim' to the government nor misuse federal taxpayer funds.”

The House panel and Justice Department still appear to be at loggerheads even after House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler wrote the department and White House late last month to say he was open to limiting the committee's subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and underlying materials to a smaller subset of documents.

But Nadler on Tuesday evening sent a new letter to the Justice Department rejecting its request to resume negotiations on the committee's subpoena on the condition that the House would delay the contempt vote scheduled for June 11.

""We urge you to return to the accommodation process without conditions,"" Nadler wrote. ""We are ready to begin negotiating immediately.""

Nadler's letter came after the Justice Department wrote to Nadler earlier Tuesday saying it could work with the committee to produce a limited set of documents. The Justice Department wrote that it was hoping for a similar concession with the Judiciary Committee that it worked out with the House Intelligence Committee for access to a set of a dozen documents related to Mueller's counterintelligence work.

EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/446897-epa-sued-for-keeping-scientists-off-of-advisory-committees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reportedly sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a directive keeping many scientists off of agency advisory panels, according to Reuters.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), alleges that an Oct. 31, 2017, directive from former EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees Overnight Energy: EPA head accuses media of not reporting agency's achievements | Leaked FDA study finds cancer-linked chemicals in food supply | Wheeler calls Flint water 'safe to drink' MORE overturned decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

The NRDC claimed that the directive has been used to remove qualified scientists from the agency's roughly 23 advisory committees, allowing EPA to replace scientific advisers with industry representatives, Reuters reported.

The nonprofit environmental advocacy group seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions that have been based on it.

A spokesperson for the EPA told The Hill it does not comment on pending litigation.

Pruitt's 2017 directive bars anyone who receives EPA grant money from serving on advisory panels, citing a need for the committees to be more independent.

The former EPA chief, who resigned in July 2018 amid a growing number of ethics and spending scandals, argued that serving on a committee like the Science Advisory Board would be a conflict of interest for someone receiving agency money to conduct scientific research.

“We want to ensure that there’s integrity in the process, and that the scientists who are advising us are doing so with not any type of appearance of conflict,"" Pruitt said at the time. ""And when you receive that much money … there’s a question that arises about independence.""

Opponents countered that Pruitt wanted to increase representation from the fossil fuel industry and other Trump administration allies on the influential committees.

Since the directive took effect, representation for regulated industries and their allies has grown on the committees, at the expense of academics and researchers, The Hill reported in February.

A legal challenge to the directive fell short that month.

Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit from public health groups, saying it does not dictate who can be appointed to advisory boards.

The laws and regulations at issue “do not dictate whom administrators must, or even should, appoint to federal advisory committees,” McFadden wrote in a ruling dismissing the case.

“To say that certain individuals may not serve is very different than saying that the rest must serve,"" he wrote. ""Agency heads retain substantial discretion to determine membership on federal advisory committees.”"
