Trump mocks NBC with doctored video of mic glitch that hampered debate,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/technical-difficulties-nbc-struggles-with-mic-problems-cuts-to-commercial-break,"President Trump continued to mock NBC News on Thursday morning for technical issues during the first Democratic primary debate, posting a hilarious doctored video of him appearing at the debate to the tune of ""Crazy Train"" by Ozzy Osborne.

""Thank you @MSNBC, real professionals! @chucktodd @maddow,"" he wrote, adding a video made by Carpe Donktum, Trump's favorite meme creator on the Internet.

Trump went after NBC News for a rather embarrassing transition into its second hour of the first Democratic primary debate, where they faced technical difficulties that forced them to cut to a commercial break.

MSNBC' HOSTS CLASH AFTER ONE SAYS NOBODY ON STAGE COULD BEAT TRUMP

After moderating the first half of the debate, ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt, ""Today"" co-host Savannah Guthrie, and Telumundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart handed the telecast over to ""Meet The Press"" moderator Chuck Todd and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. But things derailed quickly after the candidates struggled to hear Todd's first question.

""I think we had a little mic issue in the back,"" Todd said as he looked towards the control room at the back of the venue, latter adding ""We have the audience [audio] on.""

As Todd attempted to continue with his question on gun control, microphone issues continue to be easily detected. Many of the candidates smiled awkwardly while others like Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, began laughing.

""What is happening?"" Maddow asked.

""We are hearing our colleagues' audio,"" Todd exclaimed. ""If the control room can turn off the mics... if the control room can turn off the mics of our previous moderators...""

""You know, we prepared for everything,"" Maddow sheepishly said. ""We did not prepare for this.""

""We're going to take a quick break, we're gonna get this technical situation fixed,"" Todd promised viewers.

The technical difficulties sparked quite a reaction on social media, including from President Trump.

""@NBCNews and @MSNBC should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate,"" Trump tweeted. ""Truly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are!""

2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang also had fun at the expense of the liberal news outlet.

""Oh no- technical difficulties. It's the Russians,"" Yang quipped.

The first set of Democratic debates were being broadcasted on NBC News, MSNBC, and Telemundo. Thursday's debate will feature ten more candidates including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif."

Trump Wants To Withdraw Deportation Protections For Families Of Active Troops,https://www.npr.org,['Franco Ordoñez'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/27/736362986/trump-wants-to-withdraw-deportation-protections-for-families-of-active-troops,"Trump Wants To Withdraw Deportation Protections For Families Of Active Troops

Enlarge this image toggle caption Moises Castillo/AP Moises Castillo/AP

The Trump administration wants to scale back a program that protects undocumented family members of active duty troops from being deported, according to attorneys familiar with those plans.

The attorneys are racing to submit applications for what is known as parole in place after hearing from the wives and loved ones of deployed soldiers who've been told that option is ""being terminated.""

The protections will only be available under rare circumstances, the lawyers said they've been told.

""It's going to create chaos in the military,"" said Margaret Stock, an immigration attorney who represents recruits and veterans in deportation proceedings. ""The troops can't concentrate on their military jobs when they're worried about their family members being deported.""

Officials with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which offers parole in place as a ""discretionary option,"" declined to discuss questions about the ending of the program.

Defense Department and military service officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the program.

Parole in place

The program the Trump administration wants to curtail does not protect all immigrants facing removal proceedings from being deported.

It specifically allows military family members who have come to the country illegally — and can't adjust their immigration status -- to stay in the U.S. temporarily. A spouse who overstayed a visa, for example, would not be protected under the program.

The original objective of the policy was to minimize disruption to the life of a soldier, sailor, airman or Marine whose family member might have been subject to deportation.

Parole in place enables a soldier serving in Afghanistan, for instance, not to worry that a spouse at home who entered the U.S. illegally might be thrown out of the country while the soldier is deployed.

The spouse has the ability to receive ""parole"" within the U.S. and apply for a green card — unlike someone without that privilege who might be deported and required to wait for years to apply.

It wasn't immediately clear how many people are using this now or have in the past.

New battle within broader immigration war

The procedures are changing as the U.S. government ramps up enforcement proceedings, including against veterans and their family members — sometimes in ways that violate its own procedures.

For example, a federal watchdog reported earlier this month that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not follow its own policies on deporting former service members since 2013, which included during the Obama administration.

Immigrants have always served in the military and often become citizens. Nearly 130,000 troops have been naturalized from over 30 foreign countries since Oct. 1, 2001.

Service doesn't necessarily guarantee citizenship for troops but it can offer them a path to that, as well as some benefits for people related to those serving, like the parole privilege.

Activists scramble before end to privilege

One government lawyer is urging immigration lawyers to act quickly before the program is officially terminated next month.

""I would advise clients that if they are eligible for [parole in place] to submit it ASAP,"" a government lawyer warned other attorneys in a message obtained by NPR, adding later: ""Wish there was better news to share. Big take-away is that no group is 'safe' any longer.""

Carlos Luna, founder and president of a green card veteran chapter of the League of Latin American Citizens, said the ending of parole in place is yet another example of what he called the Trump administration's ""war against immigrants.""

""There are less and less opportunities for these people serving the country and their veteran family to go through the 'legal channels' and stay here in the country, which for many is the only place they've ever known,"" Luna said.

Luna cited the Trump administration's decision this year to close all of its international field offices and the fact that military recruits now must serve 180 days of active duty before becoming eligible to apply for naturalization — unless they're in a combat zone.

Previously they only had to wait a day.

Separating the link between service and citizenship

The Trump administration has also made it harder for some immigrants to enlist in the military with hopes their service would lead to an expedited path to citizenship.

Last year, the Pentagon began discharging immigrants recruited under a special program started by President George W. Bush.

The program, known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, or MAVNI, aimed at bringing in medical specialists, fluent speakers of challenging languages and other special skills.

Between 2008 and 2016, 10,400 individuals enlisted in the U.S. military through the MAVNI program, according to DOD data.

A federal judge in Seattle later ordered the Defense Department to stop discriminating against naturalized citizens who volunteered to serve in the military under the program.

The White House hasn't addressed the parole-in-place changes specifically, but information about them is reaching immigration attorneys against the backdrop of the ongoing political war over the southern border.

Trump, who has made immigration and the border his signature issue, urged Congress on Wednesday to close what he called the ""loopholes"" that remain.

Stock, the immigration attorney, meanwhile said she thought it might be corrosive to military readiness if troops overseas must begin worrying that their family members back home might be deported.

""I don't think people really understand we have a global military that has a multitude of immigration problems because of the fact that we deploy immigrants overseas all the time and we recruit immigrants and we recruit U.S. citizens who are married to immigrants and have immigrant parents,"" Stock said. ""The military is very international, and if you got rid of everybody in the military who had a connection to a foreigner — you wouldn't have anyone in the military."""
"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."
Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736290295/top-clean-air-official-plans-to-step-down-from-epa-post-amid-ethics-probe,"Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Bill Wehrum is stepping down as the Environmental Protection Agency's chief air quality official at the end of the month, amid mounting scrutiny over possible ethics violations.

EPA Administrator Andrew Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday that Wehrum's departure as the head of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation is both voluntary and expected.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said in a statement.

Wehrum was confirmed to the EPA post in November of 2017. Since then, he has been regarded as the architect of some of the Trump administration's most controversial climate policies, overseeing efforts to roll back regulations that limit air pollution. One casualty was the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which just last week was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy regulation — new rules that allow more greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

""I applaud Bill and his team for finalizing the Affordable Clean Energy regulation last week and for the tremendous progress he has made in so many other regulatory initiatives,"" Wheeler said.

Wehrum also crafted a proposal that would weaken future fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

""Bill Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA's history,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's John Walke, who is the clean air director of the group's climate and clean energy program. He called on the agency to ""return to its mission to protect Americans' health and air quality, and take strong climate action.""

Allegations of ethical violations dogged Wehrum throughout his EPA tenure, related to his former work as a lawyer and lobbyist for a number of the same companies the agency regulates — including some of the country's largest coal, oil and petrochemical companies.

Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into Wehrum's conduct in April, seeking to find out if he or his deputy, fellow former lobbyist David Harlow, may have loosened air pollution rules to help their former clients in the energy sector.

In a letter to eight utility companies and Wehrum's former lobbying firm, House Democrats on the Energy Committee said they were concerned that ""the Office of Air and Radiation's agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda"" of the firm's utilities clients. They added, ""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing agency policies to benefit former clients.""

Wehrum is the latest Trump administration official to leave the environmental agency under a cloud of scrutiny. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned after reports that he misused his power and spent far more taxpayer money than his predecessors had on travel and security expenses.

With Wehrum's exit, his deputy, Anne Idsal, will take over his responsibilities."
Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Nancy Cook']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/dhs-chief-immigration-1557047,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo employment & immigration Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Sean Lawler, who holds the rank of ambassador within the State Department, has been Trump's chief of protocol since December 2017. He was suspended indefinitely pending an investigation into his alleged harassment and discrimination of staff, NBC News reported.

One of the complaints against Lawler was that he would carry a whip around the office in an apparent attempt to intimidate co-workers, unnamed officials told NBC and Bloomberg.

The investigation is being conducted by the State Department and Lawler was told on Monday that he would have to leave pending the outcome, CNN reported. The network also reported that State Department officials told the office of protocol staff that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues.

The chief of protocol is responsible for overseeing details such as the proper order of receiving lines, seating placements, the formalities of joint press conferences, the proper titles of foreign dignitaries, ensuring that those dignitaries' names are spelled correctly and supplying interpreters.

""As the first hand that welcomes kings, queens, presidents, and prime ministers to the United States, Ambassador Lawler serves on the front lines of diplomatic engagement, building bridges and fostering understanding between peoples and governments,"" Lawler's biography on the State Department's website reads.

The assistant chief of protocol, Mary-Kate Fisher, will take Lawler's place on Trump's trip to Japan, NBC and Bloomberg reported. Lawler will submit his resignation when Trump returns, according to NBC.

Lawler is a native of Chicago who served more than 20 years in the Navy and previously worked as the National Security Council's director of diplomatic affairs, and as chief of protocol for the U.S. Cyber Command in Fort Meade, Maryland, his profile says.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
Justice Department sues Omarosa Manigault Newman for failing to file financial disclosure report after she was fired,https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Kate Sullivan']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/politics/justice-department-omarosa-financial-disclosure/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is suing former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman for failing to file a financial disclosure report after she was fired in late 2017.

In a civil complaint filed Tuesday in Washington federal court, Justice Department attorneys said that Newman, the former reality star and longtime associate of President Donald Trump, had been told about the form before she left her position, and ignored multiple email requests for it in the weeks after her departure.

Newman declined to comment about the lawsuit, according to her attorney, John Phillips.

In a statement, Phillips said the White House had chosen ""to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation.""

""The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman 'knowingly and willfully' failed to file a report. This is untrue,"" he said in a statement.

Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTop EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John Trump2020 Democrats spar over socialism ahead of first debate Senate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsCummings on Conway Hatch Act violations: 'This is about right and wrong' House panel votes to subpoena Kellyanne Conway over Hatch Act testimony TSA to send hundreds of workers to southern border to enforce immigration policies MORE (Md.), who at the time was the panel’s top Democrat and is now chairman, accused the EPA of impeding requests.

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

In another instance, former EPA staffers under previous Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittTrump administration to reconsider allowing controversial Alaska mining project Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests MORE told congressional investigators in June 2018 that Pruitt had directed staff to finish completing FOIA requests submitted under former President Obama before starting on those requesting information from his tenure.

Justice Department sues Omarosa for not submitting financial forms,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/26/justice-department-sues-omarosa-for-not-submitting-financial-forms/,"The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman for allegedly failing to file a required financial disclosure report after her 2017 firing.

The civil complaint alleges that the former “Apprentice” star “knowingly and willfully” failed to “file the required public financial disclosure report after her employment terminated with the Executive Office of the President.”

The suit claims that Manigault Newman was given a “post-government employment briefing” in December 2017, after her firing, in which “she was advised of her obligation … to file a termination financial disclosure report” within 30 days as part of the Ethics in Government Act.

Manigault Newman, who served as director of communications for the office of public liaison during her government tenure, allegedly ignored multiple email requests from the Justice Department, as well as the White House Counsel’s Office, reminding her to complete and return the requested documents.

A White House attorney had emailed the controversial reality star after the 30-day deadline had passed to warn that she might face a $200 late filing fee, but she continued to not respond to repeated efforts to get in touch with her.

The offense is punishable by a fine of $50,000, which the government is requesting the ex-White House staffer be charged.

The former Trump ally saw her relationship with the president go up in flames after she was fired by John Kelly and began releasing tapes of encounters she had with other Trump officials.

After her ouster, media reports began circulating that Manigault Newman had been physically dragged out of the White House after her contentious termination.

She denies those allegations, but that didn’t keep her from becoming a Trump target on social media.

In a statement, Manigault Newman’s lawyer John Phillips told The Post: “The White House chooses to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation. The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman ‘knowingly and willfully’ failed to file a report. This is untrue.”"
"DHS boss McAleenan accused of opposing, leaking planned ICE raids",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-accused-leaking-ice-raids,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April—prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up—and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.

Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue.”

He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""

The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.

“To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger—that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,” the source told Fox News, noting that “you can’t go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.”

Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.

A spokesperson in McAleenan's office denied the allegations, telling ""Fox & Friends"" that he's never leaked anything in his entire career.

Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that “due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.”

ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants “who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.”

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.

The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would “begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” Morgan said the postponement of the raids would “give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.”

He added: “I’ve got the green light to, anyone that’s here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.”

FedEx sues US Commerce Department over export restrictions that affect Huawei,https://www.cnn.com,"['Sherisse Pham', 'Cnn Business']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/business/fedex-lawsuit-intl-hnk-huawei/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) US delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.

The move comes after FedEx mishandled a couple of deliveries for Huawei , and failed to deliver a Huawei smartphone shipped from Britain to the United States.

Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand. The Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist last month , barring US companies from selling or exporting technology and components to the Chinese tech firm without first obtaining a US government license.

The restrictions have disrupted Huawei's global supply chain, and left companies like Alphabet-ownedandscrambling to figure out what they can and cannot sell to Huawei.

said in a statement Monday that the US Export Administration Regulations ""violate common carriers' rights"" by making delivery companies liable for shipments that may violate US restrictions. ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the statement said.

The regulations ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"" the company said in its lawsuit

""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"" a Commerce Department spokesperson said Tuesday.

FedEx under fire in China

Beijing launched an investigation into FedEx earlier this month, after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.

""FedEx, as a large multinational corporation, should offer the public a reasonable explanation. And they should also take responsibility for their actions,"" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang said Monday, in reference to Huawei's dispute with FedEx.

On Friday, PCMag reported that FedEx ""refused"" to deliver a Huawei smartphone sent by one of its UK writers to the magazine's New York office. It was returned to sender, with a label attached saying ""parcel returned by FedEx, due to US government issue"" with Huawei and the Chinese government, according to PCMag.

""The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error,"" FedEx spokesperson Maury Donahue said in a statement to CNN Business.

She added that the company is trying to minimize disruptions to customers as ""we adjust operations to comply with a dynamic US regulatory environment.""

Asked about the botched deliveries in an interview with Fox News on Monday, FedEx CEO Fred Smith said ""Huawei is just emblematic of this problem.""

FedEx contacted the Department of Commerce and told them that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers,"" Smith said."
Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""
Mnuchin: 'We were about 90% of the way' on China trade deal and there's a 'path to complete this',https://www.cnbc.com,['Holly Ellyatt'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal, and he's optimistic that progress can be made during weekend talks between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. ""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."
Attorney General William Barr wows Justice Dept crowd with bagpipe playing,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stoic-attorney-general-william-barr-wows-doj-crowd-with-bagpipe-playing/,"Attorney General William Barr took a break from his day job to showcase one of his hidden talents during an event with U.S. attorneys. Seated on stage Wednesday during the Justice Department event, the nation's top law enforcement official disappeared behind a curtain as a group of Pipes and Drums bagpipers from the New York Police Department, the Emerald Society, assembled in front of the auditorium stage.

Barr re-emerged onstage and tucked a bagpipe under his arm as the crowd of government attorneys laughed and applauded. A low drum beat sounded and the traditional bagpipe march ""Scotland the Brave"" began with Barr joining in. The crowd gave him a standing ovation at the end of the performance.

Barr explained that this was the first time he had played since his daughter's wedding. He found out that the Emerald Society pipers were coming as a surprise for him -- so he thought he would surprise them by bringing his bagpipes.

The attorney general's bagpipe playing is far from just a hobby. According to Pipes and Drums Magazine, Barr takes the bagpipe very seriously -- he's been playing since before his legal career began. Barr was a member of the now defunct U.S.-based Grade 2 Denny & Dunipace Pipe Band – which later evolved into the Scottish & Irish Imports and City of Washington – from the early-1980s until the early-1990s. Barr played with the band in a number of competitions, including the World Championships.

Soon afterward, Barr joined the Bush administration to serve his first stint as attorney general, effectively putting his competitive piping career on hold.

Barr later went on to serve as a board member of the U.S. Piping Foundation, an organization that supports competitions for bagpipers, from January 2017 to December 2018.

"NASA, Homeland Security receive D- grades on IT issues",https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/450520-nasa-homeland-security-receive-d-grades-on-it-issues,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were both awarded D- grades on their information technology management efforts in a biannual scorecard of federal agencies.

The House Oversight government operations subcommittee released version 8.0 of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) scorecard in a hearing on Wednesday.

The scorecard gave IT scores to two dozen agencies, as well as individual scores for each agency in areas such as cybersecurity, the modernization of technology and transparency and risk management.

The scorecard has been required since 2014 as part of the FITARA Act, which requires multiple federal agencies to boost IT security and modernization efforts. It was first published in November 2015, with the most recent previous scorecard released this past December.

While DHS and NASA both received the lowest grades, the Department of Education, the Small Business Administration, the General Services Administration, and the National Science Foundation tied for the top overall grade of a B+. No agency received an A overall score.

Scores most stayed stagnant from December, with five federal agencies increasing their scores, 14 keeping the same scores and five seeing lower scores. DHS was among those to have its grade cut, going from a C- to a D-, while the departments of Agriculture and Defense were among those that saw the most improvement since December.

Most agencies appeared to struggle most in cybersecurity, with only the National Science Foundation receiving an A in that category.

The departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Commerce all received Fs on cyber issues. Software licensing, by comparison, was the area where agencies most excelled, with 20 receiving As.

Subcommittee Chairman Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) said during the hearing that the scorecard “reflects the improvements agencies have made in implementing” the FITARA Act, and said the law would help agencies protect themselves against cyber attacks.

Subcommittee Ranking Member Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsHouse panel votes to subpoena Kellyanne Conway over Hatch Act testimony Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump to appear at fundraiser for Jim Jordan: report GOP moves to block provision banning use of Defense funds for border wall MORE (R-N.C.) told witnesses at the hearing, including officials from the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office, that the committee is working to ""attach dollars both as penalties and rewards"" for agencies.

Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/commerce-house-panel-questions-1380209,"James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (pictured), was instructed not to answer questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"

The change in the Freedom of Information Act rule comes without the normal process of public input. It was not announced but instead was placed in the Federal Register for formal publication.

The rule change appears to allow, for example, the administrator to personally review his own documents, such as emails and calendars, and decide what to release and what to withhold, though he still must comply with the applicable laws governing the release of public documents. At federal agencies, that process is typically in the hands of career employees and attorneys.

The EPA says it has fielded an unprecedented level of requests under the Trump administration, and some of its disclosures under FOIA have resulted in embarrassing revelations about agency leadership and actions.

Political appointees at the Trump administration EPA have taken a keen interest in the handling of FOIA requests, even acknowledging instances where the process was tinged with political influence. Chief of staff Ryan Jackson testified last summer that he and aides would slow-walk ""politically charged"" requests, according to congressional Democrats.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

However, student loan borrowers have found themselves waiting without answers. The Department of Education hasn't approved or denied a borrower defense claim since June 2018.

An audit in 2017 by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General found that government staff working on borrower defense claims had been instructed not to submit any additional applications for approval."
SoilWeb App 2.0 Offers Valuable Soil Info on the Go,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Tammy Cheever', 'Dee Ann Littlefield', 'Usda Nrcs In']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/26/soilweb-app-20-offers-valuable-soil-info-go,"Technology Posted by Tammy Cheever and Dee Ann Littlefield, USDA NRCS in Conservation

SoilWeb brings multiple soil data sources together to provide key soil-related information on the go.

Have you ever wondered about the soil you are standing on, at any given spot in the United States? Curious about what soil type it is? How about if the soil is easy to dig? If the soil is ideal for supporting the weight of a house or a barn? Or simply, if it will help you grow better tomatoes?

Thanks to an innovative mobile app, the world’s largest soil survey data base is available on the go. The USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the University of California at Davis recently announced that the SoilWeb app, version 2.0, is available as a free download from Google Play (Android) and the Apple app store (iOS). The app was created through a partnership between NRCS and UC Davis.

With its embedded GPS system, SoilWeb provides convenient, instantaneous soil information from the exact soil the user is standing on. The app gives users greater accessibility to NRCS’ soil survey information that has been collected across the United States since the late 1890s. The app presents the data in mobile form, helping users make better-informed decisions about the location they are researching.

A soil sample with a sharp shooter can provide a real life visual of the soil profile image detailed in the SoilWeb app.

The information can inform insurers about flooding frequency and builders about if the location could be suitable for roads, basements, or septic tanks. The agricultural real estate industry, farmland owners, and farmers interested in renting or purchasing land commonly need information about soil productivity and land capability. Knowledge of soil is also important to home gardeners and landscapers. Although soil survey information can be used for general farm, local, and wider area planning, a professional onsite evaluation is needed to supplement this information in some cases.

Location accuracy settings allow users to select between standard accuracy (less accurate and uses less battery power) and high accuracy (more accurate but may use more battery power). The location auto-refresh feature allows users to access soil maps and data real-time even as they travel about their property.

Users can simply click “Get Soil Data” on the app’s home screen and get detailed soil survey data for that spot. Furthermore, they can get information on soil taxonomy, soil series descriptions, soil property depth profiles, land classification ratings, hydraulic and erosion ratings, forest productivity, and soil suitability ratings.

The “Details” tab in the soil series description offers robust site information indicating if the site is a good location for a pond as determined by slope and water-holding capacity. This feature can also determine if site is suitable for cropland, including the type of crops it is best suited for and even the types of plants one could expect to find at that location – from trees to forbs to grasses. This is especially helpful for long range management plans for the property.

Soil suitability ratings provide customer reports based on a user’s interest. Categories include agriculture, forestry, engineering, irrigation, urban/recreation, soil contamination awareness, and wildlife. This portion of the app displays what the soil could be best suited for and provides information on how to manage the land for best productivity.

The app was developed by NRCS Soil Scientist Dylan Beaudette, in 2010 when Beaudette was a Ph.D. student at UC Davis, along with Anthony O'Geen, UC Davis professor and Cooperative Extension specialist. Through an agreement between NRCS and UC Davis, contractor Mike Walkinshaw was able to devote the last 12 months to bringing the app up to current standards with new features. The app accesses NRCS’ Web Soil Survey information, with is an accumulation of valuable soil information the agency has been collecting since the 1890s.

When producers look out across their fields and pastures, they have a good idea of what is growing above the ground. But it is soil underneath that really drives their management systems. The better farmers and ranchers understand the soils beneath their land, the more they can improve the production capability on their land.

The SoilWeb app offers this and more from the convenience and ease of a mobile device. Download it today. It’s free and we know it will become an important tool in your farming toolbox.

SoilWeb app offers detailed information about plants likely to be found in the area, offering a great opportunity for landowners to do a pasture walk and plant identification."
USDA approves $4.85 million loan for Dorr-Leighton wastewater expansion,https://www.mlive.com,"['Michael Kransz', 'Mkransz Mlive.Com']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/06/usda-approves-485-million-loan-for-dorr-leighton-wastewater-expansion.html,"DORR, MI -- The United States Department of Agriculture has approved a $4.85 million loan to help double the size of the Dorr-Leighton Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Though approved, treatment plant officials say they have to complete a number of further steps before the loan is finalized.

The expansion of the wastewater treatment plant serving Dorr and Leighton townships is needed because the plant is nearing capacity amid continued growth, according to Jeff Miling, Dorr Township supervisor and co-chair of the wastewater authority board.

Wastewater officials say the plant serves about 500 customers, which includes homes, businesses and multi-residence properties, such as an apartment complex and trailer park.

The USDA, in a press release Wednesday, June 26, said the plant upgrades are needed to meet Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy regulations.

Miling said he’s unaware of any regulatory violations and that USDA is likely referring to the plant being near the capacity at which EGLE officials require an expansion.

“We were getting close to 80 percent of capacity of our plant,” he said.

The expansion project will cost an estimated $5 million, Miling said. Wastewater officials say that if the loan comes through, bidding on the project could happen later this year.

The approved loan for the Dorr-Leighton plant is one of five announced Wednesday.

“This announcement includes more than $13 million in critical infrastructure assistance across the Lower Peninsula to ensure clean water and safe sewer systems in rural areas,” said USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan Jason Allen."

10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."
"Top cybersecurity official: U.S. should employ ""range of tools"" against active adversaries",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-krebs-top-dhs-cybersecurity-official-says-us-should-employ-range-of-tools-against-adversaries/,"Editor's note: This ""Intelligence Matters"" interview was taped on June 19, before recent cyber-related events in Iran took place.

As cyberattacks against targets in the United States grow more pervasive, frequent and sophisticated, the U.S. government should leverage a diverse array of retaliatory and response measures, according to Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

""When we understand that there is an active adversary — whether it's a criminal group, a proxy group, a nation state — the U.S. government needs to act using a range of tools both overt and covert, offensive legal sanctions, diplomatic,"" Krebs said. ""We have a broad range of tools.""

Krebs, who leads the recently elevated Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at DHS, spoke with ""Intelligence Matters"" host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell about the country's response options in what has become an increasingly broad threat landscape. As more critical systems in the U.S. become internet-connected and more foreign cyber actors refine their intelligence-gathering and offensive techniques, Krebs said, private industries and the government have no choice but to work more closely together.

(The interview with Krebs was taped before news emerged that U.S. Cyber Command had taken retaliatory strikes against Iranian targets and before CISA issued a warning to U.S. entities about a recent rise in malicious cyber activity by Iranian regime actors and proxies.)

""If we learned anything, I think, through 2016 and the Russian interference with our elections, it's: no single organization, no single state, no locality can go at this problem alone,"" Krebs said.

""When you're facing a concerted effort from the Russian military, the GRU, the SVR, the FSB, it's going to take a team effort to push back and harden the underlying infrastructure, harden our people, our citizenry, and then strike back when we have to,"" he told Morell.

In his role atop CISA, Krebs is charged with leading cybersecurity defensive efforts across the U.S. government and helping private sector organizations that own or operate critical infrastructure access information about potential threats.

""Over the intervening 15, 16 years since 2003 when [DHS] was stood up, the threat landscape has shifted dramatically,"" he said. ""We have peer and near-peer adversaries. Great power competition is a thing again.""

China and Russia are among the most capable and aggressive adversaries the U.S. faces, Krebs told Morell, though their long-term strategies have differences.

The Chinese government appears to be jockeying for economic position and seeking to make the U.S. into something of a ""client state,"" Krebs explained.

""They're not trying to disrupt us, necessarily. They're trying to manipulate us,"" he said. ""And they're getting there by intellectual property theft, acquiring U.S. companies, requiring U.S. companies to come into the Chinese market to join in [joint ventures] and tech transfer.""

""And they're as effective as they've ever been,"" Krebs told Morell. ""They're improving their tradecraft. And rather than going that whack-a-mole, onesie-twosie approach, they're going to the points of aggregation. And they're just sweeping up a whole bunch of information while they're doing it,"" he said, citing a December 2018 indictment of Chinese government-linked actors who targeted cloud service providers.

Russia, by contrast, is playing a more destabilizing role, he said.

""I look at Russia as trying to disrupt the system, particularly from an elections and undermining-democracy perspective,"" Krebs said. ""They're trying to knock us off our global position as a leader of the free world ... And that's really what it comes down to.""

""Russia's not trying to win the game. They're trying [to cause] everyone else to lose,"" he said.

As CISA works to shore up state and local election systems ahead of the 2020 election, Krebs said, his team is active in all 50 states and engaging with nearly 2,000 local election jurisdictions. CISA has also offered briefings on basic cybersecurity measures to all the presidential candidates who have entered the race.

He expressed hope that CISA's warnings and advice were breaking through.

""I mean, gosh, if you didn't learn from 2016, the you're not listening,"" he said. ""And shame on us if we're not ready this time around.""

While At Bloomberg', 'She Won The Gerald Loeb Award For Distinguished Business', 'Financial Journalism', 'The Highest Honor In Business Reporting', ""For Her Coverage Of The Financial Crisis. She Also Won The New York Press Club'S Newswire Award For Best Continuing Coverage Of A Story""]",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49400-wall-street-insider-craig-phillips-leaves-treasury-without-fannie-freddie-reform,"Craig Phillips, Department of the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s top housing advisor and the Trump administration’s point person on reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has left his position before achieving any major changes at the mortgage giants.

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"

Mark Meadows: DOJ exploring 'unbelievably unusual activity' in final months of Obama administration,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-doj-exploring-unbelievably-unusual-activity-in-final-months-of-obama-administration,"Rep. Mark Meadows said the Justice Department is examining irregularities in the intelligence community as part of its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Reacting to newly released documents on changes in U.S. procedures for sharing raw intelligence, Meadows said there was ""unbelievably unusual activity"" in the final months of the Obama administration.

""I can tell you that [U.S. Attorney] John Durham and Attorney General [William] Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" the North Carolina Republican said Monday evening on Fox News. ""They are including in part of their surveillance — really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""

On Sean Hannity's show, before Meadows was brought on to speak along with colleague Rep. Jim Jordan, attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the latest findings by his conservative watchdog group, the American Center for Law and Justice.

The records obtained by the ACLJ showed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Clapper pushing to increase access to raw signal intelligence before President Trump took office. The New York Times first reported the expanded access to intercepted communications in January 2017. Although Hannity and Sekulow played up the newly released records, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, as suspiciously timed and ""rushed,"" the Times noted the discussions for such changes to remove bureaucratic barriers stretched back years dating back to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Still, Jordan said he suspects there was evidence of nefarious intent, tying the changes to an interview Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did in January 2017 in which the New York Democrat warned then-incoming President Trump that intelligence officials ""have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.""

""So this is one of those six ways,"" Jordan said, adding that the other ""ways"" include British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier the CIA's use of informants to make contact with members of the Trump campaign.

Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016. The DOJ review of the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action.

Jordan noted how first Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to wrap up his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and that could influence Durham's efforts. ""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation. And they have told us this is broader than just the FBI — they're going to look at all of this,"" Jordan said.

""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""

The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a ""disturbing"" scheme to politicize intelligence.

A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is ""broad in scope and multifaceted"" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners."
VA health care workers say managers are trying to silence them on veteran care,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/25/veterans-affairs-health-care-workers-say-punished-speaking-out/1549658001/,"CLOSE Radiology technologist Jeff Dettbarn, alleges thousands of tests at the Iowa City VA were improperly canceled, potentially risking veterans’ lives. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Health care professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday that they are being punished for reporting problems with VA care, to the detriment of veterans and despite proclamations by the Trump administration that whistleblowers are celebrated and not scorned.

A physician from the Phoenix area, a psychologist from Baltimore and a CT technologist from Iowa City, Iowa, said they believe managers retaliated against them and tried to stop them from disclosing more issues at VA medical centers.

Their claims, first made in interviews with USA TODAY last week, contradict assertions by agency leaders and President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order and a law creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within months of taking office. The office, he said, would ""make sure that they're protected.""

The VA inspector general has since launched an investigation of the office's handling of whistleblower cases. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year raised concerns about the office allowing employees accused of wrongdoing by whistleblowers to be involved in investigating the accusations.

The employees who testified Tuesday have a track record of raising concerns about VA health care – and all three have been stripped of patient care and oversight duties.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell reported inadequate training and triage in the emergency room of the Phoenix VA. Psychologist Minu Aghevli reported improper removal of veterans from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA. CT tech Jeff Dettbarn revealed administrators had mass-canceled diagnostic test orders at the Iowa City VA without determining if veterans still needed the tests.

Dettbarn has been assigned to paperwork duties since his revelations in 2017, Aghevli was transferred to a data entry post in April and Mitchell has been kept from patient safety issues and oversight for nearly five years.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out has sent a signal to other VA employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

Aghevli likewise said she feels her treatment is ""being used as a threat against other employees"" and has a ""chilling effect"" on their speaking up about problems.

“It has a terrible effect on veterans,” she said.

""For every person who wants to speak up, there are thousands that have tried, only to be removed, demoted, (and) silence(d),"" Dettbarn said.

They recommended that more resources and staff be provided to an outside federal agency that helps whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, and an independent board that vets employee disciplinary appeals. They called for an overhaul of the Trump-created office.

Jacqueline Garrick, founder of nonprofit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, testified that they are not alone – almost 200 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 complaining of retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency.

""VA employees are ignored, attacked,"" she said, adding that the VA whistleblower office has not been the solution. ""Instead, it causes more harm,"" Garrick said.

Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project, another nonprofit group that helps whistleblowers, said the office lacks comprehensive regulations and works on an ""ad hoc"" basis.

""This maximizes confusion and enables arbitrary action,"" Devine said.

VA spokesman Randall Noller told USA TODAY last week that an assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections with latest contract,https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450505-critics-slam-epa-for-rolling-back-union-protections-with-latest,"Critics are pushing back after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced this week that it is rolling back the union protections offered to its employees.

In an email sent to agency staff earlier this week and obtained by The Hill late Tuesday, the agency announced it will implement a new contract that remains unsigned by the union itself.

“It’s styled as a collective bargaining agreement, but there’s no agreement. It’s imposed as an order, a dictate,” said Jeff Ruch, pacific director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), adding that the contract would dramatically reduce the assistance the union can offer the EPA employees.

Under the contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent.

PEER leaders said numerous EPA employees had reached out to them with concerns following the move.

The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA to stop the seven-year contract from taking effect July 9.

EPA and the AFGE, the largest union representing EPA employees, have struggled for years to negotiate a new contract for employees.

EPA officials said they put the contract in place after the union walked away from negotiations that had been dragging on since 2010. The two sides have long disagreed over how much of the union contract is up for review.

“As practical matter, if EPA decided to lay off one-third of its employees as the Trump administration has been proposing for last couple of years, the union ability to block that or even intercede is severely weakened,” Ruch said.

EPA officials claim the new contract was designed for efficiency and effectiveness.

A career EPA employee said “there are certain limitations within the arbitration provision” that apply to employees who are being disciplined or fired.

But the agency argued that disputes were being handled in too many ways.

“If you already have other avenues of redress, then giving people multiple avenues for redress doesn’t make sense, especially when you have employees file in more than one place — it's ineffective at a certain point,” the agency said.

PEER called the move “mean-spirited and petty.”

AFGE said the EPA’s actions are likely illegal.

AFGE Council 238 President Gary Morton said the current process is required by law.

“We want to follow process established by Congress,” he said.

“Really this is bigger than just the contract itself. Overall this is part of the administration’s plans as they stated to gut the EPA and deny the employees the proper resources to fulfill the mission of the agency,” Morton said.

As for office space, agency staff said eliminating the union work area is part of the EPA’s effort to reduce its overall office space.

They also said blocking the union from using the agency intranet or billboards wouldn’t hinder communication as representatives were able to communicate through their own email during the shutdown.

“A lot of it just goes back to being an efficient and effective use of our equipment and the time,” another EPA career official said."
USDA Confirms Silage Corn Can Be Planted On Prevent Plant Acres,https://www.dairyherd.com,['Anna-Lisa Laca'],,,,https://www.dairyherd.com/article/usda-confirms-silage-corn-can-be-planted-prevent-plant-acres,"This week, farmers in much of the eastern Corn Belt will be eligible to plant cover crops as the late-plant period on prevent plant acres ends there on June 26. Following last week’s announcement about the potential to harvest cover crops on September 1 instead of November 1 many farmers, particularly in the upper Midwest, started to wonder if silage corn would be eligible. According to Richard Flournoy, deputy administrator of product management for the USDA-Risk Management Agency (RMA), silage corn can be eligible for planting on prevent plant acres.

“A cover crop for crop insurance purposes, we have a broad definition, and it's generally many things that any crop that can be planted for erosion control, soil improvement, or any other type of conservation practice,” he told AgriTalk host Chip Flory.

If producers have questions about what could be considered a cover crop in their state, Flournoy suggests a visit to the local National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) office. Individual states can have a list of what crops can be considered cover crops.

Additionally, he says an “ag expert” can deem a crop eligible by determining the prospective crop meets all the cover crop definitions.

“We have on our website a link to all the folks who can be considered an expert,” he said. “A certified crop advisor is [someone] that could say in your area, corn for silage could be a cover crop. One key distinction there is it can't be corn for grain or seed, as long as it's for silage it meets that cover crop definition.”"
