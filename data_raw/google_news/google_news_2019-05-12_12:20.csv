"Mad magazine, Buttigieg bite back at Trump mockery",https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mad-magazine-buttigieg-bite-back-at-trump-mockery,"Mad magazine got in on the action between President Trump and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Saturday, after Trump compared his young political rival to a cartoon mascot from the venerable humor mag.

First, Trump took aim at Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., at a “Make America Great Again” rally on Wednesday calling him “Boot edge edge.”

BIDEN, BUTTIGIEG WERE THE BUTT OF TRUMP'S JOKES 'PREVIEWING' ATTACKS FOR 2020: JOHN MCCORMACK

“He has a great chance, don't he? He will be great,” Trump said sarcastically. “Representing us against President Xi of China, that will be great. That will be great. I want to be in that room and I want to watch that one.”

But Trump was far from finished with the young Dem. The president, who has repeatedly assigned unflattering nicknames to political foes, dug into Mad magazine history to find an apt one for the 37-year-old Buttigieg.

On Friday, in an interview with Politico, Trump declared that ""Alfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States.”

Neuman is the cartoon mascot and cover boy of the magazine, known for his red hair, the gap in his teeth and the catchphrase ""What, me worry?""

But Mad dates back to the 1950s, and Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the 2020 race, responded by saying he didn't really get Trump’s reference. (The character became a magazine icon under editor and publisher Al Feldstein, who was in charge of Mad from 1955-1984.)

“I’ll be honest, I had to Google that,” Buttigieg told Politico on Friday. “I guess it’s just a generational thing. I didn’t get the reference. It’s kind of funny, I guess.

""But he’s also the president of the United States and I’m surprised he’s not spending more time trying to salvage this China deal,” he said. That was a pointed reference to economic talks with Beijing that ended Friday without reaching a conclusive deal.

For its part, Mad couldn't resist adding its own voice to the political back-and-forth with a tweet about Buttigieg's lack of knowledge about Alfred E.: “Who’s Pete Buttigieg? Must be a generational thing.”

""I want a definitive portrait of this kid,” Feldstein recalled in a 2007 interview with AV/TV Club. “I don't want him to look like an idiot — I want him to be loveable and have an intelligence behind his eyes. But I want him to have this devil-may-care attitude, someone who can maintain a sense of humor while the world is collapsing around him.""

As for Buttigieg, though he was the butt of a Trump joke that may have eluded him because of his age, he has consistently polled higher than other, better-known Democratic contenders, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, making him a promising pick for the 2020 elections and raising the specter of future references to Mad's gap-toothed mascot."

President Donald Trump lashed out at Don McGahn on Saturday, tweeting that he was “Never a big fan” of the former White House counsel amid an ongoing battle between House Democrats and the administration over documents and testimony related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration,” the president wrote online. “Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!”

The broadside follows a Friday report by The Wall Street Journal that McGahn rebuffed a request from the White House last month to publicly state that he did not believe the president obstructed justice when Trump ordered McGahn to seek Mueller’s firing in June 2017.

According to the redacted version of the special counsel’s report released by the Justice Department in April, Trump instructed McGahn to inform Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller must be removed. McGahn refused Trump’s subsequent request to refute press reports of the president’s directive, according to Mueller’s report.

McGahn, who stepped down as the White House’s top lawyer in October, was one of Mueller’s most prolific witnesses within the upper echelons of the Trump administration. But on Tuesday, he refused to comply with a congressional subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee to produce documents having to do with Mueller’s probe, deferring to the White House.

The committee’s subpoena also demanded that McGahn testify publicly on May 21, though it remains unclear whether he will appear before the panel.

Trump told Fox News last week that McGahn should not testify before Congress, and previously denied in a tweet last month that he charged McGahn with ousting Mueller.

“As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so,” the president wrote online. “If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.”

In a tweet earlier Saturday, Trump blasted Democratic lawmakers who “only want to talk about Obstruction” after Mueller’s report found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 election.

That message was one of nearly six dozen tweets or retweets posted to Trump’s Twitter feed Saturday. The president spent several hours at his Virginia golf club before returning to the White House in the afternoon, according to pool reports."
Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country,https://www.politico.com,"['Alex Thompson', 'Marc Caputo', 'Burgess Everett']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/11/warren-west-virginia-2020-1317611,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station on Friday in Kermit, West Virginia. | Craig Hudson/Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP 2020 elections Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country The liberal firebrand draws nods and even a few cheers on a trip through rural West Virginia.

KERMIT, W. Va. — It was a startling spectacle in the heart of Trump country: At least a dozen supporters of the president — some wearing MAGA stickers — nodding their heads, at times even clapping, for liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren.

The sighting alone of a Democratic presidential candidate in this town of fewer than 400 people — in a county where more than four in five voters cast their ballot for Trump in 2016 — was unusual. Warren’s team was apprehensive about how she’d be received.

Story Continued Below

About 150 people gathered at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station to hear the Massachusetts senator and former Harvard professor talk about what she wants to do to fight the opioid epidemic. Trump-supporting college students in baggy t-shirts, housewives in pearls, and the fire chief dressed in uniform joined liberal retirees wearing rainbow “Persist” shirts and teachers with six-figure student loan debt.

Kermit is one of the epicenters of the opioid addiction epidemic. The toll is visible. The community center is shuttered. Fire trucks are decades old. When Warren asked people at the beginning of the event to raise their hands if they knew somebody who’s been “caught in the grips of addiction,” most hands went up.

“That’s why I’m here today,” she said.

Warren entered the room from behind a large American flag draped in the station. Roving around a circle of people seated in fold-out chairs, she tried to strike a tone equal parts empathy and fury, while avoiding pity. She went full prarie populist, telling people their pain and suffering was caused by predatory pharmaceutical barons.

The 63-year-old fire chief, Wilburn “Tommy” Preece, warned Warren and her team beforehand that the area was “Trump country” and to not necessarily expect a friendly reception. But he also told her that the town would welcome anyone, of any party, who wanted to address the opioid crisis. Preece was the first responder to a reported overdose two years ago only to discover that the victim was his younger brother Timmy, who died.

Preece said after the event that he voted for Trump and that the president has revitalized the area economically. But he gave Warren props for showing up.

“She done good,” he said.

Others agreed.

LeeAnn Blankenship, a 38-year-old coach and supervisor at a home visitation company who grew up in Kermit and wore a sharp pink suit, said she may now support Warren in 2020 after voting for Trump in 2016.

“She’s a good ol’ country girl like anyone else,” she said of Warren, who grew up in Oklahoma. “She’s earned where she is, it wasn’t given to her. I respect that.”

But Warren didn’t come to rural West Virginia primarily in search of votes. The tiny state likely won’t decide the nomination, and is all but certain to back Trump in the general election.

Instead, Warren was here to try to send a message that she’s serious about tackling the problems of remote communities like this one.

The “opioid war” is a medical problem rather than a behavioral or law enforcement one, Warren argued. Her plan is modeled on the government’s response in 1990 to the HIV/AIDS crisis, as she explained in a Medium post earlier this week.

“But we got a second problem in this country and it’s greed,” she said. “People didn’t get addicted all on their own, they got a lot of corporate help. They got a lot of help from corporations that made big money off getting people addicted and keeping them addicted.”

Kermit was a subject of a Pulitzer Prize winning series in 2016 that found drug wholesalers provided a single pharmacy in the 392-person town with 9 million hydrocodone pills over just two years. Warren's plan would dole out $100 billion over the next decade to states, cities, and nonprofits, with extra money going to cities and counties with the highest levels of overdoses.

“Right here in Mingo County, people are on the front lines of this opioid epidemic and this is a way to draw attention to the urgency of the moment,” she told reporters after the town hall.

Warren’s four-stop tour Friday and Saturday took her from the small towns of Kermit and Chillicothe, Ohio to Columbus, Ohio and Cincinnati. The latter's narcotics problem is so bad that the local paper assigned a reporter to the heroin beat.

Warren’s approach to the opioid crisis — which calls for treating victims and punishing perpetrators — largely mirrors her response to the financial crisis, when she called for jailing bankers and providing mass assistance for homeowners.

Her trip is the latest iteration of her campaign strategy to distinguish as the most substantive and well-prepared candidate in the sprawling Democratic field. Each time Warren rolls out a policy proposal — almost invariably with the theme of curbing corporate power and Washington corruption — her team schedules on-the-ground events to draw further attention.

When she announced her plan to break up big technology companies, Warren went to the South by Southwest tech conference and then to Long Island City, New York where Amazon had planned to build a headquarters. She whistle-stopped through Tennessee, Alabama, and the Mississippi delta after she unveiled a housing proposal aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.

A Republican protest — or “Trump support rally” — was organized a few hundred yards away from Warren's event in Kermit. But inside the fire station was remarkably devoid of partisanship, even if the topic was political.

Asked late Friday what stuck with her from the visit, Warren said it was the moment when she asked who had been personally affected by the opioid crisis and almost everyone’s hands went up.

“I was in the town where the pain of that decision by the government to not interfere was felt hard,” she said.

As Warren posed for selfies after the town hall, several people pressed notes into her hand that she read later in the car. ""Help our town of Kermit, West Virginia any way you can to help us be able to reduce the drug abuse,"" read one letter.

“A lot of people told me,‘You’re in the reddest of the red here,'” Warren said. But ""I like being here."""
Trump tells China to 'act now' on trade or face a 'far worse' deal in his second term,https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/11/trump-tells-china-to-act-now-on-trade-or-face-a-far-worse-deal-in-his-second-term.html,"President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping shake hands at a press conference following their meeting outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last November.

President Donald Trump on Saturday called for China to act now on trade or risk facing a worse deal if negotiations continue into a possible second term after the 2020 presidential election.

Trump claimed China was 'beaten so badly' in recent trade negotiations that Beijing wanted to wait until after the 2020 election in the hope a Democrat would win the White House and offer them a better deal.

Trump, however, said he would prevail in the upcoming election and warned that a trade deal would be 'much worse' for China if it was negotiated during his second term.





Chinese and U.S. negotiators held trade talks in Washington on Friday after Trump more than doubled tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, raising the rate from 10% to 25%. The administration is also moving to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods.



Trump said Friday's talks were constructive and negotiations will continue while tariffs remain in place, though they could be lifted depending on how the situation progresses.



Treasury Secretary Steve Mnunchin told CNBC no further trade talks are planned between the two sides ""as of now."" Chinese state media has reported that the next round of talks is expected to take place in Beijing.



Trump abruptly announced the tariff hike last Sunday, shattering hopes that a trade deal was near and sending U.S. markets into turmoil for much of the week. The president cited slow progress in negotiations as the reason for his decision.

Chinese negotiators had reportedly backtracked on key aspects of the trade deal, removing commitments to change domestic laws to address U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers among a number of other issues.

Can Wharton Revoke Trump’s Economics Degree Now?,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['David Rothkopf'],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/can-wharton-revoke-trumps-economics-degree-now,"Despite all the success enjoyed by 19th century industrial magnate Joseph Wharton, the 21st century has not been kind to his family’s legacy. His great-great-great grandson, Josh Rosen, was ignominiously canned as quarterback by the Arizona Cardinals and sold off for peanuts to the Miami Dolphins. But even worse, the family name he gave to the business school he founded at the University of Pennsylvania has been irreversibly damaged by one of that school’s graduates, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.

Admittedly, even though the Wharton School took money from the Trump family and admitted his children Ivanka and Don, Jr., it never bragged that much about its association with Trump given his checkered business past. Every Ivy League school has had its share of sleazy, vulgar, business-destroying alums they’d rather not discuss. It’s just that most of them don’t end up being president.

Now, Trump’s Wharton education is yet again under the spotlight because Trump is daily demonstrating just how little he learned about economics while studying there. Or while running businesses. Or ever.

Just this Friday morning, the world was treated to a Trumpian Twitterstorm about his ill-considered, mismanaged trade war with China that was so profoundly dumb that it would surely have earned anyone who submitted it as a paper an F in an intro-to-economics course.

Once again he bragged about the tariffs he had imposed on China and that he had now increased them from 10 to “25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products” (the capitalizations are his…a subject for another column, perhaps one by a neuropathologist). Trump then said that the tariffs were “NOW being paid to the United States by China,” so that with the “over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.”

He went on to say that Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier and quicker to do.” He concluded this particular tear through logic, sound economics, arithmetic and syntax with the assertion that “Tariffs will make our country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch.”

As usual, Trump started with a lie. Higher tariffs are not now being paid to the U.S. That won’t happen for a few weeks, until goods shipped after the tariff hike make their way here.

Next, and most important, the tariffs are not being paid to the United States by China. The tariffs are being paid on Chinese goods purchased by American consumers and businesses. In other words, the money does not come from China. It comes from Americans. It is a new tax on Americans from the president who promised to cut taxes but has proven to be really bad at that too. Poorer Americans who often buy lower-priced Chinese manufactured goods such as shoes and clothes will end up being those hurt most, just as they were the ones to benefit least from the Trump-GOP tax cuts.

Now this is a mistake Trump makes over and over. He just doesn’t get who is paying or being hurt by the tariffs. Except, apparently when it comes to farmers. He cares about them, which is why he is promising to use the money from the tariffs to buy products from the farmers that Chinese, retaliating against the U.S. tariffs, are declining to buy. He does not seem to understand the size of the deficit the U.S. has racked up. To put it in terms he can follow, it’s yuge.

So yuge big that the tariffs won’t make a dent in it. So the relief payments to farmers will have to be borrowed by the U.S. Who do we borrow from? Yup, that’s right. We borrow a bunch from the Chinese. So, we are going to pay them for money we are going to use to pay off farmers injured by bad U.S. policies thus enabling the Chinese to make money off the trade war.

Oh, and whatever you do, don’t look at the effect Trump’s tweets had on the stock market for most of the past few days. Not that most Americans have a big stake in the stock market. But Trump’s friends and fat cat supporters do and they don’t like this uncertainty one bit. (For good insights into how badly Trump is playing all this, read the great piece by Catherine Rampell in Friday's Washington Post.)

Now the market rebounded a bit Friday when Trump and the Chinese both said that a little progress was being made in the talks. And frankly, most of the trade experts I know think a deal will ultimately come. But there are even a couple problems associated with that. One is that after China stops buying U.S. agricultural or other products and starts to get them from other countries, often it does not return to buying from the U.S. as it did pre-trade interruption because having more suppliers produces more competitive pricing for them and reduces U.S. leverage.

But worse is that everything we have heard about the pending deal suggests that while it may include big promises from the Chinese to buy U.S. products (which are seldom delivered upon), and some market opening (in the financial sector for example), it will not deal in a meaningful way with the real long-term problems in the U.S.-China relationship centered on trade in technology and services, IP protection, and investment rules in these areas.

Further, it is rumored it will include a dispute resolution mechanism which will be bilateral. That means China and the U.S. will promise to work out future disputes between each other, by-passing and thus weakening vital multilateral mechanisms like the WTO and increasing the likelihood of future tit-for-tat trade spats in the future.

The blow to the WTO would be devastating, and it would compound Trump’s earlier wrongheaded attacks on international institutions and the post-World War II international order the the U.S. labored for three-quarters of a century to build, including pulling out of the TPP agreement, imposing steel and aluminum tariffs, renegotiating NAFTA which produced a deal that is unlikely to be ratified by the Congress and really doesn’t produce any major improvements over the old deal, and threatening to get into a trade war with key allies over automobiles. (For a good take on this, see Ed Luce in the Financial Times.)

All of which is to say: WTF, Wharton?

While Trump’s serial tax fraud and business failures did not shame you into revoking his degree, surely such public displays of economic illiteracy should. Yes, we know that Trump did not attend the Wharton graduate school, which is really the prestige program. And yes, we long ago learned he did not graduate first in his class as was long advertised. We even have heard that one of his professors once called him “the dumbest goddamn student I ever had.” Which is believable.

We even know that poor old Joseph Wharton was himself a protectionist. But he embraced those policies in the late 19th and early 20th century, during the period in American history sometimes known as the Era of Real Dumb Ideas That Didn’t Really Work. We know better. And as a scholar and a scientist and an entrepreneur and a poet who also helped found Swarthmore College, Wharton would likely have learned his lesson. And that, as a Quaker and an educator and a man of learning, he would have been repelled and appalled by the school which bears his name’s most ignominious graduate.

Daniel Turner: President Trump can secure a major bipartisan win – here’s how,https://www.foxnews.com,['Daniel Turner'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/daniel-turner-president-trump-can-secure-a-major-bipartisan-win-heres-how,"President Donald Trump is drawing much deserved praise this week for his efforts to help workers at the Lordstown, Ohio General Motors plant keep their jobs. Earlier this year, GM ended car production in the factory and threatened to eliminate 1,700 jobs.

But instead of standing idling by, President Trump took action. He called up and pressured GM CEO Mary Barra to change course, and now she’s done it. The president announced on Twitter this week that GM found a buyer for the plant – an electric truck company – and that GM is even spending another $700 million to create 450 new jobs in Ohio.

For the Acela-corridor chattering class, these are just numbers on a page. But for Lordstown and so many small communities across Ohio, it is a game changer.

TRUMP: GM SELLING LORDSTOWN PLANT TO ELECTRIC TRUCK COMPANY WORKHORSE

It is also good politics for the president, who will need Ohio to stand behind him for his continued political success.

That’s why when opportunities for sound public policy and good politics present themselves, the president should pounce. Fortunately, there’s another way the president can appeal to Ohio voters and protect vulnerable families in the process – by helping protect the solvency of coal miner pensions in Ohio, West Virginia and other coal country states.

President Trump has already done much to help protect coal jobs by fighting and removing unnecessary regulations. Unfortunately, the war on coal – waged by the Obama-Biden administration along with billionaire Michael Bloomberg and the Sierra Club’s “Beyond Coal” campaign – was all too effective. During the Obama-Biden years, 83,000 coal miners were put out of work. They left office with 400 fewer coal mines operating in America.

The industry suffered as a result, and along with it the pension plans for 100,000 retired coal miners. Now, their plans are threatening to go insolvent.

That’s why a bipartisan coalition of senators, including Democrats Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, along with their Republican counterparts Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, are pressuring Congress to pass legislation to shore up the coal miners’ pension fund.

Just this week, members of the United Mine Workers of America, along with a bipartisan group of members of Congress, rallied in Washington to support legislation to help these miners.

Senator Rob Portman explained, “We’ve been mining coal in Ohio since before Ohio was a state…this is just a matter of fairness.”

“What they did was power America. And they were given a promise, and it was a promise that when they retired, that they would get a benefit under their pension,” Portman continued.

Senator Joe Manchin noted that, “The superpower of the world is here because of the coal miners standing behind me.”

“No matter what part of the country you’re from, you should get on your knees every night and say a prayer for a coal miner.”

Senator Portman and Senator Manchin are exactly right. These miners poured their lives into powering our country and making us the superpower we are today, and they deserve our support.

The coal industry did not suffer because of market forces or emerging technologies. Coal was targeted for political reasons. And in their goal of shuttering the industry, green groups, their backed elected officials and billionaire donors gave little thought for the thousands of men and women they were driving into unemployment.

Our government – thanks to the Obama-Biden war on coal – put these retired miners in this position. It’s time to make it right.

This is an opportunity for President Trump to secure a major bipartisan win. It would allow him to demonstrate yet again his willingness to work across the aisle, and it would be a potent achievement he could point to as he campaigns in Ohio for a second term.

Good politics and good policy is the sure way for President Trump to lock in Ohio, but it also can help these coal miners retire with dignity.

And after years of political attacks by powerful green groups and the previous administration, coal workers deserve a win.

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

Secretary Pompeo to Meet With Putin as President Trump Seeks Better Russia Ties -- Again,http://time.com,"['Nick Wadhams', 'Ilya Arkhipov']",,,,http://time.com/5587644/pompeo-putin-trump-russia/,"U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo leaves for Moscow on Sunday, with President Donald Trump again calling for improved ties now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his investigation.

Pompeo will meet U.S. diplomats at the American Embassy in Moscow on Monday before continuing to Sochi for talks with President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials. The secretary has 48 hours — the entire length of the trip — to cram in discussions of disputes between the two nations, involving Ukraine, Venezuela and Syria and other issues, along with continued accusations of election interference.

With the Mueller inquiry wrapped up, Trump has returned to signaling his interest in improving U.S.-Russia ties, speaking with Putin for more than an hour last week and tweeting that there is “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.” The two leaders had kept their distance as Mueller’s probe into the 2016 U.S. election and allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia heated up.

“Clearly since the Mueller report came out, Trump is feeling unconstrained about what he’s wanted all along — a new relationship with Moscow where all the bad issues get swept aside and the two leaders ‘get down to business,”’ said Andrew Weiss, the former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council who’s now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“What that means in practice is really fuzzy because the agenda largely consists of issues where the U.S. and Russia are at loggerheads,” Weiss said.

Trump spoke with Putin briefly on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina in December. That meeting rekindled criticism of their summit last July in Helsinki, where the American president appeared to take Putin’s side over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies when asked about evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

Pompeo could use his trip to start laying the groundwork for a meeting between Trump and Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 forum in Japan set for late June. Such an encounter would still be fraught, especially since Trump has appeared reluctant to confront Putin on the meddling accusations, which the Mueller report reaffirmed.

“The Mueller report confirmed accusations of Russian meddling,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-founded think tank. “The report to some extent rehabilitates Trump but doesn’t rehabilitate Moscow at all. For Russia, nothing has really changed.”

A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Pompeo would raise a range of topics, including continuing concerns about Russian election meddling, Moscow’s role in propping up Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the American desire for more sweeping arms control agreements that include countries like China, not just Russia and the U.S.

The official argued that U.S. policy is to seek a better relationship with Moscow while also acknowledging that Russia has been responsible for several acts of aggression on the world stage.

One challenge, as it’s been throughout Trump’s presidency, is that while he may want better ties with Russia, relations between the two countries have seldom been worse and show little prospect of improving.

Besides contesting support for Maduro, there is the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in February. The administration is also angry at Russia over its detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors in the Sea of Azov last November and the poisoning of a former spy in the U.K. last year. In addition, American businessman Michael Calvey remains under house arrest in Moscow over allegations of fraud, a charge he rejects.

The president’s latest tweet on Russia also highlighted the dissonant tone the Trump administration has struck toward the country. While Pompeo blamed Russia for Maduro’s refusal to leave power despite pressure from the U.S., Trump said after his call with Putin that the Russian leader wasn’t looking to “get involved” in the crisis in Venezuela.

Trump’s calls will find a receptive audience. After the Mueller report came out, Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachyov urged the president to “take the risk” and seize the opportunity to reset relations.

“Putin has always bet personally on Trump, with whom he has a way of bonding to the point of manipulation,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and foreign policy analyst in Moscow. “Putin knows Trump likes him, while his administration does not. In Trump he trusts.”

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker admits he is 'nervous' about DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-admits-he-is-nervous-about-doj-inspector-general,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker admitted on Friday that he is “nervous” about DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into the conduct of the DOJ and the FBI during the Trump-Russia probe.

Sitting down with with Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes in a crowded room at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Baker said he is “assuming that they will dig and find stuff” and that “we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.” But Baker defended the FBI's actions, including its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Horowitz’s investigation is particularly focused on alleged FISA abuse and the reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele in FISA applications targeting Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS. The investigation is expected to finish in May or June.

Wittes said that Baker “had expressed great confidence in the way you guys conducted yourselves, in the integrity of these fundamental judgments, in the opening with respect to two separate investigations and with the respect to the handling of this FISA application.” Wittes then asked Baker: “So, how nervous are you about the IG?”

Baker said he is “always nervous about the IG,"" adding that “they’re coming in after the fact to look at what we did."" At the time, he said, the FBI was “trying to do it in real time and having the pressure to deal with these threats as they were coming.”

Baker contended that he was “confident in the judgments that I made at the time based on the information that I had available to me.” But he left open the possibility that others may have engaged in wrongdoing, saying, “I’m sure they will find things that I didn’t know at the time and maybe that others didn’t know at the time.”

“There were facts that existed in the Bureau that were known by certain people that weren’t known by others including me, that’s certainly possible and that happens frequently,” Baker said. “And so, I’m assuming that they will dig and find stuff like that. So, we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

During the event Friday, Baker defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier and stressed that he examined the FISA warrant applications on Page before they got signed and sent to the court. He said he was “comfortable” with their contents and was confident that the process remained “lawful.” Regarding the FISA court, Baker said: “These are federal judges for goodness' sake. They know how to evaluate wiretap applications. ... These are serious, serious judges.”

On the bureau’s handling of Steele, Baker said, “We’re not stupid. The FBI. We’re not stupid.”

And Baker said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker. ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line,"" he said.

“We are the Federal Bureau of Investigations, not the Federal Bureau of Conclusions,” Baker said defensively.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. And the New York Times reported that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Baker mentioned that he’s faced investigations before. “I’ve been investigated — or matters that I’ve worked on have been investigated — many times by the Inspector General. It’s not a pleasant process. It’s just not. The people are pleasant but the process is not the most enjoyable,"" he said.

Baker may have been referring to an alleged criminal leaks investigation that had been opened on him, which had been reported on as early as December 2017. He confirmed the existence of an investigation but declined to provide many specifics, saying, “Yes there is an investigation with respect to matters in which I was involved that is still open that I have cooperated fully with. I met with the investigative team for many hours over many days. That took place about a year and a half ago.”

“I haven’t heard anything since then … other than to hear from the Department that the matter is still open.” Baker said. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal.”

Baker was appointed as the FBI general counsel in January 2014 and was later reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, Baker resigned from the FBI and has since written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

As the event ended, Baker summed up his thoughts on all of these investigations. “Hindsight is 20/20,” he remarked."
House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Kelsey Snell'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721876476/house-democrats-subpoena-trump-tax-returns,"House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/05/10/after-outcry-usda-will-no-longer-require-scientists-label-research-preliminary/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

Pompeo to visit Russia as Trump pivots to repairing relations post-Mueller report,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pompeo-visit-russia-trump-pivots-repairing-relations-post/story?id=62964426,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will make his first trip to Russia, arriving in Moscow on Monday and meeting with Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday in Sochi.

The trip is an important step in President Donald Trump's pivot back to trying to repair relations with Russia – a goal of his since he was a presidential candidate.

But it comes with intense scrutiny over how Trump has approached Russia, praising Putin, downplaying his aggression around the world, and declining to condemn his oppression at home -- even as his administration has taken strong action against his war in Ukraine, the poisoning of a former spy in the United Kingdom, and more.

It also comes less than a month after special counsel Robert Mueller released his report detailing extensive contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government, but finding no conspiracy to interfere in the election.

Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP

Last Friday, Trump and Putin spoke, with the president saying Putin ""sort of smiled"" as they talked about how the Mueller investigation ""started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse.""

""Getting along with Russia and China, getting along with all of them is very good thing, not a bad thing. It’s a good thing,"" he added.

A senior State Department official wouldn't say if the long-awaited release of that report is why Pompeo is now ready to head to Moscow. But they told ABC News the trip is a ""good opportunity... to take that conversation [with Russia] to a higher level and for a frank exchange of views on where the challenges and opportunities are.""

On Monday, Pompeo and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit in Finland after three phone calls in the last three months. That followed a period of near silence and high tension, with no calls since August 2018 and Trump canceling a formal meeting with Putin at the G20 in November over Russian seizure of three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors.

Pompeo will be watched carefully back in Washington, especially by critics in Congress, for how he treats the Russians. While the president has consistently carried a different tune, calling for warmer relations with the government that meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to support him, Pompeo has staked a middle ground, saying there may be areas where the two countries can work together.

""Where we have concerns, we're going to raise them directly, narrow those differences, and find areas where we can cooperate to protect and advance our interests,"" the official said, speaking anonymously to brief reporters on behalf of the department.

Ahead of the trip, the State Department pulled at least one punch. Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus released a statement Thursday that praised the conviction of two Russian intelligence officers in Montenegro as ""a clear victory for the rule of law, laying bare Russia's brazen attempt to undermine the sovereignty of an independent European nation.""

But the next day, the official statement disappeared from the department's website. The State Department declined to comment, but Foreign Policy magazine reported that the statement was released by mistake against Pompeo's wishes.

Trump has similarly been slow to criticize Putin's government, from telling Fox News in his first year in office, ""You think our country's so innocent?"" to denying Russia is involved in Venezuela last Friday. He's also continually cast doubt on the Kremlin's cyber attacks and interference in the 2016 election, infamously saying alongside Putin in Helsinki, Finland: ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.""

Among the top issues on the table, Pompeo will look for ways to counter terrorism together, resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, deal with regional challenges like North Korea, and negotiate new arms control agreements.

""We are not going to solve these issues overnight, but we have to be engaging to create opportunities for progress,"" the official said, pointing to talks on North Korea, Afghanistan, and counterterrorism as successes so far.

But the other issues will be difficult, given that Russian interference in Ukraine and Syria has caused and perpetuated those wars, respectively, and that Russian violations of arms control pacts like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty have pushed the U.S. to withdraw from the INF Treaty and possibly others, according to U.S. officials.

Still, Pompeo told ABC News he hopes ""we can find places where we can have overlap in our interests... It makes perfect sense that any place we can find where we have overlapping interests, we work along with the Russians,"" he told ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl on ""This Week"" Sunday."
"Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: 'Rumors' Trump is quashing DOJ, FBI investigations",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-rumors-trump-is-quashing-doj-fbi-investigations,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Friday there are ""rumors"" that President Trump is quashing investigations run by the Justice Department and the FBI.

During an interview on MSNBC, Baker told host Rachel Maddow he decided to speak out because of Trump's bullying tactics.

He said ""it could have a significant negative impact in the long run"" because people are worried about their careers and reputations.

""When the president of the United States starts to go at you on Twitter it's ... unnerving,"" he said. ""If you're concerned about your reputation and your long-term career, you're more likely to be hesitant to do things that will attract that type of ire.""

Maddow asked if he is aware of any investigations that have been impeded because of Trump's behavior, and Baker said he has ""heard rumors to that effect"" but none that he could confirm. He did acknowledge that this dynamic was ""currently"" at work.

""Whether it's true or not, it's something to worry about,"" he said. He noted that ""certain types of investigations, especially as they start to touch the political system or political leaders"" are the ones to worry about.

Baker's interview comes after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, which details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. He declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

The FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Baker, who is under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media, has been subject to criticism by Trump for his role in allowing the use of an unverified dossier to obtain the authority to spy on a member of his 2016 campaign, Carter Page.

“Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled,” Trump tweeted in January. “They relied heavily on the unverified Trump ‘Dossier’ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for ‘a Russia probe.’ This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax.”

Baker said Trump's intimidation tactics against the FBI are ""very dangerous,"" but believes that the career officials at the bureau are highly resilient and are going to ""resist"" Trump as much as they can."

“I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didn’t care,” Trump tweeted. “Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!”

The president’s tweet comes a day after the New York Times reported: “The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee subpoenaed the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service on Friday, disregarding the Treasury secretary’s refusal this week to hand over six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns and demanding access.”

Last month, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declared that the current members of Congress are “not smart enough” to review Trump’s tax returns.

“I don’t think Congress, particularly not this group of Congressmen and women are smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume that president Trump’s taxes will be,” she said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. “My guess is most of them don’t do their own taxes, and I certainly don’t trust them to look through the decades of success that the president has and determine anything.”

Trump is the first president in decades not to volunteer the information, saying his returns are under audit. Notably, there is no law that prohibits returns under review from being shared.

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
Russian agent saw political analysis as 'valuable' to Russia,https://www.weau.com,['Michael Balsamo Associated Press'],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/Russian-agent-saw-political-analysis-as-valuable-to-Russia-509753601.html,"A Russian gun rights activist who admitted she was a secret agent for the Kremlin and tried to infiltrate conservative U.S. political groups while Donald Trump rose to power says she believed her notes and analysis would be ""valuable"" for Russian officials.

Maria Butina, who admitted covertly gathering intelligence on the National Rifle Association and other groups at the direction of a former Russian lawmaker, spoke to National Public Radio in an interview airing Friday.

Butina pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent and was sentenced in April to serve 18 months behind bars. The 30-year-old has been jailed since her arrest in July.

Butina admitted that she had worked with former Russian lawmaker Alexander Torshin to use their contacts in the NRA to pursue back channels to American conservatives during the 2016 presidential campaign. She violated U.S. law because she did not report her activities to the U.S. government.

As part of her plea agreement, Butina acknowledged she ""sought to establish unofficial lines of communication with Americans having power and influence over U.S. politics.""

In the interview with NPR, Butina admitted that she knew Torshin was providing the information she gleaned to Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said that she was honored to help.

""I said that I would be honored because, well, I am a young woman and there you have people in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would consider my notes, my analysis, as valuable,"" Butina said. ""It was very pleasant for me. So of course I said, 'Of course, yes.'""

Butina admitted she should have registered with the U.S. government but argued her actions took place out in the open and she wasn't a spy. Her lawyers argued she was simply a student interested in American politics and better U.S.-Russian relations.

""I love both countries, and I was building peace,"" Butina said in the interview.

Now, Butina is ""embarrassed that instead of creating peace by not registering I created discord,"" something she says she'll carry with her for the rest of her life.

Butina will be deported back to Russia after she finishes serving her prison sentence. She said she has no concerns about returning to Russia because people who know her ""know as a matter of fact that I am not a spy nor do I have any secret information.""

""I don't think I have any problems or I could have any concerns about my safety,"" she added. ""I don't see that happening.""

The charges against Butina were brought by federal prosecutors in Washington, and her case was separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Butina said she knew nothing about Russia's efforts to interfere in U.S. elections.

U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/us-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflicts-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign board of Huawei at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."
TBCSL letters to DOJ requesting investigation of TN House Speaker Casada's office,http://fox17.com,['Jason Hall'],,,,http://fox17.com/news/local/tbcsl-letters-to-doj-requesting-investigation-of-tn-house-speaker-casadas-office,
Nine Charged in Alleged SIM Swapping Ring — Krebs on Security,https://krebsonsecurity.com,[],,,,https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/nine-charged-in-alleged-sim-swapping-ring/,"Eight Americans and an Irishman have been charged with wire fraud this week for allegedly hijacking mobile phones through SIM-swapping, a form of fraud in which scammers bribe or trick employees at mobile phone stores into seizing control of the target’s phone number and diverting all texts and phone calls to the attacker’s mobile device. From there, the attackers simply start requesting password reset links via text message for a variety of accounts tied to the hijacked phone number.

All told, the government said this gang — allegedly known to its members as “The Community” — made more than $2.4 million stealing cryptocurrencies and extorting people for restoring access to social media accounts that were hijacked after a successful SIM-swap.

Six of those charged this week in Michigan federal court were alleged to have been members of The Community of serial SIM swappers. They face a fifteen count indictment, including charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and aggravated identity theft (a charge that carries a mandatory two-year sentence). A separate criminal complaint unsealed this week charges three former employees of mobile phone providers for collaborating with The Community’s members.

Several of those charged have been mentioned by this blog previously. In August 2018, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that police in Florida arrested 25-year-old Pasco County, Fla. city employee Ricky Joseph Handschumacher, charging him with grand theft and money laundering. As I reported in that story, “investigators allege Handschumacher was part of a group of at least nine individuals scattered across multiple states who for the past two years have drained bank accounts via an increasingly common scheme involving mobile phone SIM swaps.”

This blog also has featured several stories about the escapades of Ryan Stevenson, a 26-year-old West Haven, Conn. man who goes by the hacker name “Phobia.” Most recently, I wrote about how Mr. Stevenson earned a decent number of bug bounty rewards and public recognition from top telecom companies for finding and reporting security holes in their Web sites — all the while secretly operating a service that leveraged these same flaws to sell their customers’ personal data to people who were active in the SIM swapping community.

One of the six men charged in the conspiracy — Colton Jurisic, 20 of, Dubuque, Iowa — has been more well known under his hacker alias “Forza,” and “ForzaTheGod.” In December 2016, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a woman who had her Gmail, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts hijacked after a group of individuals led by Forza taunted her on Twitter as they took over her phone account.

“They failed to get [her three-letter Twitter account name, redacted] because I had two-factor authentication turned on for twitter, combined with a new phone number of which they were unaware,” the source said in an email to KrebsOnSecurity in 2016. “@forzathegod had the audacity to even tweet me to say I was about to be hacked.”

Also part of the alleged Community of SIM swappers is Conor Freeman, 20, of Dublin, Ireland; Reyad Gafar Abbas, 19, of Rochester, New York; Garrett Endicott, 21, of Warrensburg, Missouri.

The three men criminally accused of working with the six through their employment at mobile phone stores are Fendley Joseph, 28, of Murrietta, Calif.; Jarratt White, 22, and Robert Jack, 22, both from Tucson, Ariz. Joseph was a Verizon employee; White and Jack both worked at AT&T stores.

If convicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, each defendant faces a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The charges of wire fraud each carry a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Last month, 20-year-old college student and valedictorian Joel Ortiz became the first person ever to be sentenced for SIM swapping — pleading guilty to a ten year stint in prison for stealing more than $5 million in cryptocurrencies from victims and then spending it lavishly at elaborate club parties in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

"London’s mayor says Trump ‘not in same class’ as Obama and Bush, not worthy of state visit to Britain",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects', 'May At Pm']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/10/londons-mayor-says-trump-not-same-class-obama-bush-not-worthy-uk-state-visit/,"

London Mayor Sadiq Khan. (Jack Taylor/Getty Images)

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not “in the same class” as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

“Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,” Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

“History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,” Khan said. “President Trump is not in the same class as those two.”

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit — but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan “rude” and “ignorant” on “Good Morning Britain.”

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. “It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,” Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.”

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

“The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,” Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. “There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.”

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in “Hugh Grant-type, public scene,” referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie “Love Actually.”

“We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn’t do so,” Khan said. “Your relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.”"

Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
Justice Department sends off Rod Rosenstein on a funny note,https://nypost.com,['May'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/09/justice-department-sends-off-rod-rosenstein-on-a-funny-note/,"WASHINGTON – The current and former attorneys general had a laugh over contempt charges, nicknames from President Trump and being hunted by paparazzi at a send-off for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Attorney General William Barr started his speech by asking the crowd – gathered in the Justice Department’s Great Hall – for its two cents.

“There’s been a debate raging the last few months and I think we have to get it resolved and decided tonight and that is – which one of us is capable of the best deadpan expression,” Barr said, asking Rosenstein to come up and stand alongside him.

“Now, I know this is a little unfair because I do my best work in the hearing, in Congressional hearings. Rod does his standing behind the attorney general at press conferences,” Barr said.

The audience gave the retiring Rosenstein the win.

Barr then couldn’t help but crack a joke about the House Judiciary Committee’s Wednesday vote to hold him in contempt.

“You like records,” he said to Rosenstein. “This must be a record of an attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.”

Jeff Sessions, the previous attorney general, also remarked how their time at the top of the Justice Department was “not normal.”

“So when we came in, I had no doubt … there would be a lot of controversies during my tenure. The office of attorney general just frequently finds itself in the vortex of law and politics and separation of powers. But in truth, I have to say, our run exceeded my expectations,” Sessions said to laughs. “Considerably,” he added.

“So when I recused, using the recent words of Attorney General Barr, the baby fell to Rod,” Sessions continued, speaking of the Russia investigation.

He reiterated his support for Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“He made every decision based on his best judgement of what he thought was best for this country,” Sessions said.

Sessions also pointed out how Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Mueller also made him a household name.

“I remember at dinner at a nearby restaurant with Noel Francisco and Rod and I – a lot of things were going on – the paparazzi caught us,” Sessions recalled.

The top three DOJ officials had dined at Central Michel Richard, a restaurant across from the Trump Hotel in D.C., and near the Department of Justice, on the heels of the president calling Sessions “disgraceful.”

“And even that dinner became some sort of message, or so it seemed,” Sessions recalled Thursday.

Sessions also brought up a pop song that referenced Trump’s alleged nickname for Rosenstein, called “Mr. Peepers.”

“I understand the girls are big fans of Ben Folds, who produced a Rod Rosenstein ballad,” Sessions said, referencing Rosenstein’s daughters. “I don’t know if it hit the top of the charts, but it was pretty good.”

And when it was Rosenstein’s turn to speak, he talked about how he had told his family that deputy attorney general was an under-the-radar position.

Now he said, “Congressional hearings are one of Julie’s favorite forms of entertainment,” he said of his daughter.

Rosenstein’s final send-off came from his deputy Ed O’Callaghan – the bearded guy who’s stood behind both Barr and Rosenstein at notable press conferences.

“The beard has also been used most recently to focus the media’s attention on some important issues such as ‘who’s the bearded guy behind the AG?’ the same day some report was issued,” O’Callaghan said referencing the press conference held at the DOJ moments before the Mueller report was released.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""
"Facing Democratic resistance, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promotes oil and gas drilling",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'The Washington Post']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/10/facing-democratic/,"Washington • The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Donald Trump’s plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

""So that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,"" he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. ""What I hope is, as an organization we learn from any error we make.""

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department's decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation's carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

""The law requires us to analyze those things,"" he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. ""It doesn't say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.""

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president's order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said that he expected to get a briefing on this week's U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world's plants and animals are at risk of extinction, but added that Interior and the Commerce Department still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

""We didn't start doing them to not do them,"" he said.

As he pursues the administration's agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on Interior.

Article continues below

""We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,"" McCollum said. ""Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what's the bare minimum.""

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately on Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

""You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,"" he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary's office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska's Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"
Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan as secretary of defense,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/9/18517095/patrick-shanahan-defense-secretary-nomination-pentagon-mattis-trump,"The White House says President Donald Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan, who has spent more than four months as the acting secretary of defense, for the permanent job. It’s likely his reward for being so amenable to President Donald Trump’s policies — from China to Venezuela to the southern border — since taking over the Pentagon’s top position.

“Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a Thursday statement. “Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job.”

Shortly afterward, Shanahan, a former top Boeing executive who spent 30 years at the company, said in a statement that he looks forward to becoming the defense chief, if confirmed by the Senate. “I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe,” he said.

Shanahan has been in the acting role since January 1, when he stepped in to replace outgoing Defense Secretary James Mattis after Mattis dramatically resigned, mainly in response to Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.

But though he’s been serving as the acting secretary for months, it was never guaranteed that he would get the position full-time. In March, the Pentagon’s inspector general looked into allegations that Shanahan boosted Boeing while acting in his official capacity. However, in late April, the watchdog cleared Shanahan of the potential ethics violation.

There were also concerns among Trump officials that Shanahan couldn’t do the job after a series of lackluster performances during congressional testimonies in which he flubbed important questions about America’s defense policy and wars abroad.

He’s overcome those obstacles, though. And assuming the Senate confirms him, he’ll be set to lead America’s armed forces — as long as he stays in Trump’s good graces.

Shanahan has to stay on Trump’s good side

Sources told me that Shanahan and Trump have a very strong relationship. They have spoken at length in the Oval Office about Pentagon issues, and about their shared view that weapons programs are unnecessarily expensive and cumbersome. It also helps that National Security Adviser John Bolton seems to like Shanahan too, sources note.

By most accounts, Shanahan did a good job as Mattis’s deputy. His main role was to run day-to-day Pentagon operations and try to reform the bureaucracy as much as possible. He also gained Mattis’s trust over time, even though he wasn’t originally the former Marine general’s first choice.

However, Shanahan didn’t spend much time on foreign policy in the Defense Department or in his three-decade career at Boeing, so taking on the top role permanently will be a big change for him.

The reason Trump likes Shanahan, though, may come down to one very simple thing: He’s deferential. During a Cabinet meeting on January 2, for example, Shanahan sat stoically next to Trump as the president slammed Mattis for keeping America’s military involved in conflicts overseas, particularly in Afghanistan.

Shanahan has also reportedly told Pentagon leaders to focus on “China, China, China” — a country the president cares about challenging — which may also keep him in Trump’s good graces.

Mattis, on the other hand, was known to challenge Trump on occasion, and their relationship eventually broke down over Trump’s desire to withdraw troops from Syria.

It’s unclear at this point if Shanahan will push back on anything Trump wants to do."
US Treasury Ironically Accusing Vietnam of Currency Manipulation,https://beincrypto.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-ironically-accusing-vietnam-currency-manipulation/,"Recent months have seen increasing tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) via increases in interest rates. These have come in response to a robust US economy, a high-flying stock market, and a strong US dollar.

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong — the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country’s actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam’s active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam’s tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‘trustless’ environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

Schiff subpoenas DOJ for unredacted Mueller report and counterintel info,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/08/adam-schiff-subpoena-mueller-report-1313078,"Alex Wong/Getty Images mueller investigation Schiff subpoenas DOJ for unredacted Mueller report and counterintel info

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to the Justice Department on Wednesday for the unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in addition to all of the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information collected during the 22-month investigation.

The subpoena comes after Schiff (D-Calif.) and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, made a rare joint request for the documents. Schiff said the Justice Department had yet to respond to the committee’s request, prompting him to issue a subpoena.

“The department has repeatedly failed to respond, refused to schedule any testimony, and provided no documents responsive to our legitimate and duly authorized oversight activities,” Schiff said in a statement.

“The department repeatedly pays lip service to the importance of a meaningful accommodation process, but it has only responded to our efforts with silence or outright defiance,” Schiff added. “Today, we have no choice but to issue a subpoena to compel their compliance.”

The committee’s subpoena requires the Justice Department to turn over the documents by May 15.

Schiff and Nunes penned joint letters to Barr — one on March 27 and another on April 25 — demanding the full Mueller report and its supporting materials. In the second letter, the lawmakers threatened a subpoena “absent meaningful compliance” by the end of last week.

In his letter to Barr informing the attorney general of the subpoena, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee required the information in order to “discharge its unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities,” including conducting oversight, examining potential national security issues and drawing up legislation to address vulnerabilities.

Schiff said the Justice Department claimed that it was accommodating his and Nunes’ request by allowing the lawmakers — in addition to 10 other senior members of Congress — to view a less-redacted version of the report.

“Neither of these responses amounted to a good faith effort to negotiate an accommodation of the committee’s request,” Schiff wrote, adding that his staff reminded the Justice Department of its “expansive and voluminous” production of documents related to the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

“These materials were of the precise type the department now claims it is prohibited from giving to the full committee, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information, documents related to third parties, and those pertaining to ongoing investigations,” Schiff wrote.

The committee’s announcement comes the same day the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel’s subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence.

Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the full report and its underlying materials — at Barr’s urging — in order to prevent the Justice Department from complying with the committee’s subpoena.

Schiff’s and Nunes’ numerous requests for the full Mueller report come despite efforts by Republicans on the Judiciary panel to back the Justice Department’s position that Congress does not have a right to the materials — in particular, the grand-jury information.

"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump’s $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation’s two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan’s third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan’s second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, “Given the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.”

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

“The problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president’s budget will do that,” said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president’s request."
"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
Dispute over Bible at Manchester VA hospital divides veterans,https://www.concordmonitor.com,"['Tom Krisher', 'Michael Liedtke -', 'Terry Tang -']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.concordmonitor.com/Northwood-NH-veteran-bible-display-at-manchester-va-25467746,"An Air Force veteran is suing the Manchester VA Medical Center over the display of this Bible.

John Newman, pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, holds up his Bible on his property on Lucas Pond in Northwood on Friday. GEOFF FORESTER / Monitor staff

John Newman, pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, holds his Bible in front of the cross at his home compound on Lucas Pond in Northwood on Friday, May 10, 2019. GEOFF FORESTER—Monitor staff

Religion played an important role in John Newman’s Irish-Catholic family when he was a young boy growing up in Newfoundland, Canada, but he says it wasn’t until he faced combat in Vietnam that he fully realized his belief in God.

“Your most heavily involved combat veterans, they find a piece of faith in there somewhere, and they cry out to God one way or another, I know I did, when you think you’re going to get killed and the bullets are flying,” he said.

Newman recalled several close brushes with death during his service, including a harrowing rescue mission where he and his men went into enemy territory to find a U.S. aircraft that had wrecked. The pilot died when the plane went down, he said, but Newman and his men made it out alive. He later received a Bronze Star for that mission.

Through the decades that followed the war, Newman’s faith grew. He is the pastor at Higher Ground Ministries in Barnstead, a church he established in 1986.

His identity as a veteran has also remained important in his life, attending reunions with other men from his battalion and playing bagpipes at memorial services at the Veteran Cemetery in Boscawen.

Newman has been receiving medical care at the Manchester VA ever since he returned home. When he learned that a group of veterans was calling for the removal of a Bible on display at the hospital, he grew frustrated and feared it could set a precedent to remove other religious symbols from veteran memorials.

In Newman’s opinion, the Bible in dispute over at the VA – which was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II – represents more than Christianity.

“That Bible is probably the best thing there because it represents all religions and so many different sects of religion,” he said in an interview at his Northwood home tucked away on Lucas Pond. “I’m very disappointed in these guys.”

The display is called the Missing Man Table and honors missing veterans and prisoners of war. The table is stationed at the main entranceway to the hospital and is sponsored by Northeast POW/MIA Network.

A federal lawsuit was filed against the VA this week in Concord, demanding the Bible be removed immediately and permanently.

The plaintiff is James Chamberlain, an Air Force veteran and New Hampshire resident as well as a devout Christian. The lawsuit, penned by Chamberlain’s attorney, Lawrence Vogelman, argues the inclusion of the Bible is unconstitutional.

The lawsuit says the government cannot “give favoritism to one religious belief at the expense of others.”

“We would all be outraged if the MVAMC only provided care to Christians, or denied care to non-believers, or those who worship their God in other ways,” the suit reads. “The placement of a Christian Bible on this sacred table is just as objectionable.”

In January, 14 veterans who also receive care at the Manchester VA submitted complaints about the Bible display to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, a civil rights advocacy organization for active military members and veterans, according to the suit.

Shortly after the MRFF received the complaints, the organization’s president, Michael Weinstein, called the Manchester VA leadership and demanded the Bible be removed, according to the lawsuit. Weinstein received an email later that day from the acting staff assistant to the director of the Manchester VA saying the Bible would be taken off the display.

“I want you to know that can inform your clients that the Manchester VAMC has the utmost respect and admiration for all Veterans, regardless of belief,” the email read, according to the suit. “As such, we are going to be removing the Bible from the display to better serve all veterans.”

Less than a month later, on Feb. 23, some of the veterans who called for the Bible’s removal reported to the MRFF that the Bible had returned to the display and was locked in a plexiglass box.

It was at this point, according to the court papers, that Chamberlain came forward as another complainant and was willing to be the named plaintiff in a lawsuit, despite also receiving care at the VA.

“Despite his strong personal religious beliefs, he believes that the Christian Bible has no place being displayed on the POW/MIA table,” the lawsuit reads. “As a Christian, he respects and loves all his military brothers and sisters and does not want to be exclusionary by the placement of the Christian Bible.”

The other complainants, who come from a variety of religious backgrounds, wanted to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation, according to the suit.

The press secretary for the Department of Veteran Affairs, Curt Cashour, issued a statement shortly after news broke that the Manchester VA was being sued.

“This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,” Cashour said.

When the Bible was removed, officials at the VA say they received “an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action.”

The Bible was returned to the table after the hospital consulted their lawyers. Cashour said the decision to initially remove the Bible was made “out of an abundance of caution.”

“We apologize to the veterans, families and other stakeholders who were offended by our incorrect removal of this Bible,” he said.

Newman, a Vietnam veteran from Northwood, said he believes the VA made a knee-jerk decision to pull the Bible off the table after hearing the complaints.

“Every time there is one voice against something ... we immediately bend,” he said. “This erosion, it starts with this Bible issue, and when one thing starts there’s a domino effect. We have a table with a Bible on it at our Veterans Cemetery. Once they start with this, do they want to take everything away?”

Justice Department Charges Daniel Everette Hale With Leaking Secrets to Media,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Olivia Messer'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-charges-daniel-everette-hale-with-leaking-secrets-to-media,"A former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency has been charged with leaking classified information to the press about the Obama administration’s use of armed drones, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. It’s the latest in a series of prosecutions by the Trump administration aimed at sources of the press.

Daniel Everette Hale, 31, was charged under the Espionage Act of illegally disclosing top-secret and secret documents to a news organization, according to an indictment filed in March and unsealed Thursday. He was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday morning.

Details from the indictment suggest the organization is The Intercept, which did not respond to a request for comment. It is the third time the Justice Department has prosecuted an alleged Intercept source in the past two years.

Hale served in the Air Force from July 2009 to July 2013, during which time he was assigned to the National Security Agency, according to the indictment. He was deployed to Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence analyst. While still at the NSA, in April 2013, Hale allegedly began communicating with an unnamed reporter.

The two met on multiple occasions and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to the indictment. Hale allegedly texted a friend in May 2013, claiming that “[the reporter] wants me to tell my story about working with drones at the opening screening of his documentary about the war and the use of drones.”

Hale left the Air Force in July 2013 and was hired by a defense contractor, where he was assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. From February to August 2014, Hale allegedly printed a total of 36 documents and provided at least 17 to the reporter, some of which were unclassified, according to the indictment. Eleven were secret or top secret documents.

The documents contained a PowerPoint presentation on counterterrorism operations, described a military campaign targeting Al-Qaeda, included information gathered by the NSA on specific named targets, and outlined U.S. military technical capabilities. The documents were later compiled and published by the news website and in a book authored by the reporter, according to the indictment.

Hale was charged with theft of government property and several other counts under the Espionage Act.

Hale’s arrest comes amid a crackdown on leakers to journalists by the Trump administration. Last month, the U.S. charged WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange with allegedly helping veteran intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack a computer password to steal classified documents. In October, a Treasury Department employee was charged with sharing financial information on targets of the Mueller investigation with BuzzFeed.

Last year, two purported Intercept sources were also prosecuted. Former NSA contractor Reality Winner was sentenced to 63 months in prison for leaking classified information about Russian election interference to The Intercept. In October, former FBI agent Terry Albury was sentenced to four years in prison after he pleaded guilty to making an unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, apparently related to how the FBI recruits informants."
"State Department should be investigated too, for actions overseas",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'L. Todd Wood']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/9/state-department-should-be-investigated-too-for-ac/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

With the investigations of the investigators beginning under the watch of Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department, we would like to highlight that it has not just been the FBI, and America’s other intelligence agencies, who were corrupted during the Obama administration.

The State Department is also knee deep in the Deep State with Obama holdovers working their seditious black magic in the cubicles of Foggy Bottom and around the world.

We have written extensively on these pages about the corrupt actions of Ambassador *Donald Lu in Albania, where he used the powers of his office to interfere in the political discourse of a foreign country, supporting the socialist government of Prime Minister Edi Rama, a man who is so close to Leftist philanthropist and activist George Soros that he was invited to his wedding. Mr. Lu even went so far as to cancel American visas of Albanian opposition figures in his bid to curry favor with the far left and ensure socialist rule. He has since left Albania for Kyrgyzstan, where he is up to his old tricks, once again interfering in local affairs and pushing the globalist agenda, right under the nose of the leadership in Washington.

Mr. Lu’s supposed replacement for Albania, former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Kathleen Ann Kavalec, had her nomination withdrawn from consideration in Congress after information surfaced that she was connected to the Fusian GPS attempted coup by the Deep State.

The current U.S. Charge d’affaires Leyla Moses-Ones was caught blatantly and arrogantly tweeting against her boss, President Trump last year. More precisely, she retweeted a disloyal Twitter ramble about Mr. Trump by possibly soon to be indicted former head of the FBI, James Comey. Once exposed, Moses-Ones’ tweet was swiftly deleted.

We have also written about how the American embassy in Tirana has been actively involved in ‘judicial reform’ in Albania, which has led to complete lawlessness in the country of oligarch rule, because no constitutional court has been empaneled. That was the goal all along of course. The law was written by Soros consultants.

Former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, meanwhile, was caught ‘unmasking’ scores of Americans during her tenure with the Obama administration. This situation has not really been delved into by authorities, as the Trump-Russia hoax has sucked most of the oxygen from the room for the past two and a half years. Ms. Power’s actions should be investigated, however. Why in the world would the ambassador to the United Nations need to unmask American citizens via FISA surveillance? Hopefully we will know the answer to that question one day.

Just this week, the American representative to Ukraine, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was forced out two months early from her post. The allegation is that she played a role in State Department collusion with the Ukrainian government to ensure the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by releasing damaging information on Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

Reports are that Ukraine’s prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Ms. Yovanovitch actually gave him a “list of people whom we should not prosecute” during their first meeting. Of course, these were allegedly all Obama administration officials.

The Soros’ cancer runs deep and wide throughout the State Department, where American tax dollars are a convenient piggy bank for his army of NGOs around the world which routinely are granted large amounts of money to work the open borders and open society globalist agenda.

This has to stop.

Americans are tired of big government working behind their backs for other nations and other agendas rather than Trump’s America First. To fully drain the swamp, Foggy Bottom needs to receive a visit from the Trump plumber.

Suicides on VA properties sound the alarm on veteran care,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Dean Reynolds'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-military-veteran-suicides-on-veterans-affairs-properties-sound-the-alarm-on-veteran-care/,"Veterans can talk with a trained counselor through the Veterans Crisis Line.

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."

A similar bill died during the regular session earlier this year.

The plan would establish the Cabinet-level position of state resiliency officer under the state National Guard.

The division has operated under the National Guard's authority since Gov. Jim Justice's order in October. Justice said then the move would make the division more effective and efficient.

James Comey on DOJ inspector general's Trump-Russia investigation: 'Let's hear it',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-on-doj-inspector-generals-trump-russia-probe-lets-hear-it,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but ""if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it.""

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, exactly two years after he was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, Comey said no matter what is found by Horowitz's probe or by the investigation being conducted by Attorney General William Barr, ""they should be transparent about it.""

Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper told Comey that “the inspector general, the attorney general, they're now obviously looking into the origins of the investigation into the president and his campaign.” He asked Comey: “Are you confident you did everything by the book, and that the FBI, the people around you did everything by the book?”

[ Related: DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier]

Comey said he was confident that he, and the FBI more broadly, had done nothing wrong, replying, “Yes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn't mean I'm against review of it. That's totally fine.”

Cooper then pressed him further, asking, “So you think the inspector general will find nothing inappropriate?”

Comey said, “I don't think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.”

The Justice Department inspector general is looking into alleged FISA abuse related to surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The watchdog is also investigating the FBI’s reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier. That research was compiled at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier was a key part of FISA applications and renewals; Comey signed off on three of them.

[ Also read: Barr says 'multiple criminal leak investigations underway']

Cooper told Comey that “CNN has spoken to people within the FBI that say they have concerns that the inspector general could find something, and that they are bracing for what may be uncovered.”

Comey emphasized he looked forward to the results of the investigation and stressed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by himself or by the FBI. “Again, I'm a big believer in the truth. If the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it. I don't know of anything like that,"" he said.

Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during 2016 was criticized in a voluminous report released by Horowitz in June 2018, which Cooper reminded Comey of by saying that the Justice Department inspector general “called your decision not to inform the bosses about the Clinton press conference, they called it extraordinary, insubordinate.” Cooper further reminded him that “they also said your letter to Congress about reopening the Clinton emails investigation to the emails was based on your personal views even if it meant rejecting long-standing department policy or practice.”

Comey replied, “Yeah, that's fair criticism.”

Cooper then asked, “Is it true? Extraordinary and insubordinate and that it rejected long-standing policy practices?”

“Yes, except for the insubordinate part,” Comey contended.

Barr has said Horowitz’s Trump-Russia investigation into the actions of the Justice Department and FBI should be completed in either May or June."
"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Read More: CIA Gives Tech Rivals Chance to Take on Amazon in Cloud Services

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Ryan Mccrimmon']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/interior-department-salaries-threat-1414201,"Chairman Elijah Cummings also complained that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Energy & Environment House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

Story Continued Below

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

Justice Department charges Deep Dot Web administrators with money laundering – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/doj-deep-dot-web-indictment/,"U.S. prosecutors have formally brought charges against the alleged co-owners and administrators of Deep Dot Web, who were arrested Tuesday.

Tal Prihar, 37, and Michael Phan, 34 — both Israeli citizens — were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to a newly unsealed indictment.

Prihar, who resided in Brazil, was arrested by French police in Paris on Monday, while Phan was arrested by Israeli police in a simultaneous raid.

The two are accused of making millions of dollars in commission from Deep Dot Web, a website featuring news, reviews and information about dark web sites and marketplaces. Prosecutors said the administrators made their commission by linking to marketplaces on the dark web — only accessible through Tor, an encrypted anonymity network.

Many of the dark web marketplaces sold drugs, weapons and stolen data, which hackers could use to break into online accounts.

A staffer at Deep Dot Web said in a Medium post following the arrests that Deep Dot Web would generate a slice of the revenue from purchases made on dark web marketplaces, said to be as much as 4%. Brazil’s federal police said in a statement the site made millions in dollars in cryptocurrency from referral sales from more than 15,000 dark web users.

Following the arrests, the FBI seized Deep Dot Web’s website.

“It was truly a 50:50 partnership between the two defendants,” said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference in Pittsburgh on Wednesday announcing the charges.

According to the district attorney, more than 23% of all transactions made on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace taken down by authorities in 2017, were associated with a referral link from Deep Dot Web. The indictment also said Deep Dot Web referred more than 198,000 users to Hansa, another defunct market, accounting for nearly half of the site’s users, of which Deep Dot Web “received a commission on all of those users’ purchases.”

The indictment said Prihar and Phan made about 8,155 bitcoins in total — almost half of which was collected from AlphaBay. Prosecutors said at its peak, the bitcoins were worth more than $15.4 million.

“This is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,” said Brady."
Vietnam veteran files federal lawsuit to remove Bible on display at VA hospital,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vietnam-war-veteran-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-bible-at-veterans-hospital,"A Vietnam War veteran filed a federal lawsuit against the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center this week in an attempt to remove a Bible on display at the New Hampshire facility.

James Chamberlain, who served in the U.S. Air Force, is a Christian but believes the Bible in the VA facility’s lobby violates the First Amendment. According to the lawsuit, the Constitution bars the government from giving “favoritism to one religious belief at the expense of others.”

""Despite his personal beliefs, he is offended that other people's beliefs are not represented,"" Chamberlain's attorney Larry Vogelman said, according to NBC Boston . ""To isolate one religion and hold it out as the official religion is just wrong.""

The Bible, which was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II, is featured at the Missing Man Table that remembers missing veterans and prisoners of war. But the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday, claims that the original table tradition didn’t feature the Bible and that the table should honor all who served.

The Bible was initially removed in January after the Military Religious Freedom Foundation said that 14 veterans of multiple faiths opposed its placement. However, the Bible was put back in February.

Curt Cashour, a spokesperson for the VA, said in a statement that the VA would not be “bullied” moving forward.

""This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,"" Cashour said."
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
