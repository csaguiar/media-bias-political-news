"Angry Dem says Trump ‘raping the country,’ as impeachment push nears critical mass",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/angry-dem-says-trump-raping-the-country-as-impeachment-push-nears-critical-mass,"A rapid-fire string of developments has congressional Democrats putting increased pressure on party brass to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, with one rank-and-file lawmaker reportedly saying the president is “raping the country” and others indicating it's only a matter of time before leadership changes course on the politically fraught issue.

Amid the internal tensions, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a special meeting of House Democrats for Wednesday morning, where the impeachment issue and other battles are expected to be discussed.

Prior meetings involving Pelosi and top Democrats held Monday evening escalated into heated exchanges, with the party torn over how to address Trump controversies -- most recently, the decision to block the former White House counsel from testifying. Democratic leaders, who for the most part have not been publicly in favor of impeachment, are now finding it difficult to maintain their position as calls grow from the ranks to flip that switch.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN NADLER: TRUMP IS MAKING IT 'MORE DIFFICULT' NOT TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT

A senior House Democrat told Fox News late Monday that Pelosi “isn’t going to be able to hold off on impeachment much longer,” and that the speaker may have to change her position “within the next two weeks.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while saying Pelosi is working to bring the party together, suggested Tuesday that politics are the main element preventing members from pressing ahead at this stage.

“Just as impeaching without cause could be construed, and is, politically motivated, choosing to not impeach when there is an abundance of cause could also be construed similarly,” she told reporters.

Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., reportedly confronted Pelosi during a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee meeting as he demanded the president's impeachment. According to Politico, Cohen said that while former President Bill Clinton was impeached “over sex,” Trump was “raping the country.”

Cohen reportedly suggested Pelosi is worried about politics in her reluctance to proceed, but Pelosi countered, “This isn’t about politics at all. It’s about patriotism.”

Cohen is among the most outspoken Trump critics in Congress. He drew attention by eating fried chicken during a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing as a commentary on Attorney General Bill Barr’s refusal to testify. Cohen referred to the attorney general as “Chicken Barr,” despite Barr having testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee the previous day. Cohen has also called for the House to use its inherent contempt power to throw Barr in the Capitol jail.

But as House Democrats weigh contempt proceedings for Barr, another fight broke out Monday after former White House Counsel Don McGahn was instructed by the president's team to defy a subpoena from the same committee. Democrats wanted him to testify regarding information he provided to the Special Counsel's Office, but the White House directed him not to appear, with the Justice Department asserting he has immunity from testimony about his official duties.

""The Democrats do not like the conclusion of the Mueller investigation – no collusion, no conspiracy, and no obstruction – and want a wasteful and unnecessary do-over,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said after a closed-door meeting with Pelosi that Trump is “making it very difficult to avoid” considering impeachment.

Pelosi insisted that her party remains united, saying Tuesday that she's not feeling pressure from colleagues.

“There’s no divide,” she said a day earlier. “We’re fine. We’re good.”

Nadler, meanwhile, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that he intends to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress for not complying with the subpoena. Nadler said the White House’s effort to keep McGahn from testifying was part of a pattern of “lawless behavior,” and Trump is “willing to go to any lengths to prevent testimony that might implicate him.”

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., head of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Monday that McGahn’s failure to testify on Tuesday would be grounds for opening an impeachment inquiry.

In addition to fighting off Democratic efforts to have McGahn testify, the president is currently in the midst of legal battles over Democratic subpoenas for his personal records. He sued Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to block a subpoena for his banking records, and was also trying to keep documents from accounting firm Mazars USA away from Congress.

A judge ruled against Trump in the Mazars case on Monday, stating that the House Oversight Committee was entitled to view the documents. The main argument from the Trump administration has been that Democrats lack a legitimate legislative purpose for their inquiries, but Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the possibility of finding conflicts of interest in the administration or violations of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause sufficed.

FEDERAL JUDGE SIDES WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER SUBPOENA FOR TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

Pelosi touted Mehta’s ruling as a win, as well as a reason why impeachment is not necessary at this point.

“Today, we won our first case,” Pelosi reportedly said at the Steering and Policy Committee meeting. “We’ve been in this thing for almost five months and now we’re getting some results.”

Opinion | China Deserves Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas L. Friedman'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html,"China kept insisting it was still “a poor developing country” that needed extra protection long after it had become the world’s largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world’s biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world’s next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.

And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a “Made in China 2025” modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China’s private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.

This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America’s best companies.

As a result, all China’s subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we’d be crazy. Trump is right about that.

Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time — and they have been. I’m not sure Trump understands that.

But I’m not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?

And how much money did China save — to subsidize its own companies — when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?"

I’ve argued time and again that the smart play is IIABN: Impeachment in All but Name, but the great beast of Washington shambles ever forward, its ponderous, inexorable tread leading it toward the inevitable impeachment proceedings against Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States.

Albany Closes a Loophole for Trump Pardons. Next Up: His Taxes.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jesse Mckinley'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/nyregion/trump-tax-return-bills-new-york.html,"“We're asked to set aside that fundamental concept of fairness and equity, not because we're faced with any actual situation, but a hypothetical situation,” said Assemblyman Andy Goodell, a Republican from Jamestown, N.Y.

That argument was echoed by the outgoing state Republican Party chairman, Edward F. Cox, who said that the State Legislature was suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome.”

“They should be focusing on people in New York State, and what they need,” Mr. Cox said.

Republican ire was likely to be raised on Wednesday, too, as both the Assembly and the Senate planned to pass the bill creating a pathway for Congress to seek Mr. Trump’s state tax returns, which are likely to contain much of the same financial information as the president’s contested federal returns. New York is the president’s home state and the headquarters of his business.

Efforts to obtain Mr. Trump’s federal tax returns have been repeatedly thwarted by the president’s refusals to release them, citing pending audits. That intransigence hit new heights in recent months, as the White House has defied congressional subpoenas and has said that Democrats will “never” see his returns.

The White House had no immediate comment on the New York bills.

In remarks on the chamber floor before the vote, Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, a Democrat from Brooklyn, called passage of the double jeopardy bill a victory for states’ rights amid federal defiance.

“It has to do with presidential power, period,” Mr. Lentol said, adding, “This new law will confront any president, not just this one, who thinks that he or she can get away with washing away illegal behavior.”

Neither of the two bills specifically mentions Mr. Trump, though lawmakers have not been shy about their intentions to pursue the president’s financial information. There have also been efforts to avoid legal challenges, including several recent amendments to narrow the state tax bill’s focus to public officials, employees or officials in the federal executive branch, as well as other holders of government posts and political party leaders."
"Julianna Margulies’ Trump nightmares had her waking up ‘screaming,’ she tells Colbert",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/julianna-margulies-trump-nightmares-had-her-waking-up-screaming-she-tells-colbert,"The way actress Julianna Margulies tells her story, she’s probably lucky she didn’t wind up in an ER.

The former “ER” star told “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert on Monday night that for a while she would wake up “screaming” from nightmares after Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016.

Margulies recalled one dream in particular, according to the Washington Examiner.

KELSEY GRAMMER PRAISES TRUMP, CALLS WASHINGTON POLITICIANS A 'BUNCH OF CLOWNS'

“I was in a boardroom, there was a long table, and it was just a guy who's in the Oval Office right now, sitting there and I walked in and I [was] screaming, screaming. ... I mean I was going crazy and screaming,"" she said.

She soon decided to stop following the news, in hopes her Trump nightmares would end, she said, according to the Examiner.

Eventually, however, the star of ""The Good Wife"" said she resumed getting her news from the New York Times, NPR and “PBS NewsHour,” she said, according to the Washington Times.

Separately, Margulies told EW Radio and Sirius XM's Jessica Shaw that she turned down a CBS offer to appear on ""The Good Fight,"" a CBS All Access spinoff of ""The Good Wife,"" because she wouldn't be paid at the same rate that she earned on ""The Good Wife.""

“I wasn’t asking for $1 million. I wasn’t asking for $500,000 an episode,"" she told Shaw, according to EW.com. ""I was asking what I got paid on 'The Good Wife.'. So, a spin-off of my show, to play a character that created that show, was asking what she should get paid, and it wasn’t asking for the moon.”

She added that she used to conceal from the media the real reason why she declined the offer, but not anymore, EW.com reported.

“I thought, Why am I protecting CBS? I said yes. They said no,"" she said. ""And you know what? I need to pave the way for the next one coming up. … I also know for a fact that any male star who is asked to come on a spin-off of their show would’ve been offered at least $500,000. … I’m not angry, I just needed to speak my truth. … If they were to ask me to go back on 'The Good Fight,' paying me what my salary is, [I would be there] in a heartbeat.”"
Rex Tillerson Secretly Meets With House Foreign Affairs Committee to Talk Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-secretly-meets-with-house-foreign-affairs-committee-to-talk-trump,"Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson spoke with the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs committee on Tuesday in a lengthy session that, an aide said, touched on his time working in the Trump administration, the frictions he had with the president’s son-in-law, and efforts to tackle issues like Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Tillerson’s appearance, first reported by The Daily Beast, took place as virtually every other Trumpworld luminary has been stonewalling congressional oversight efforts. At the same time the former secretary of state was speaking before lawmakers, former White House counsel Don McGahn was ignoring a subpoena to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

Tillerson’s arrival at the Capitol was handled with extreme secrecy. No media advisories or press releases were sent out announcing his appearance. And he took a little-noticed route into the building in order to avoid being seen by members of the media.

Tillerson reached out to the committee and expressed a willingness to meet, a committee aide said. In a more than six-hour meeting, he told members and staffers that the Trump administration actively avoided confronting Russia about allegations of interference in the election in an effort to develop a solid relationship with the Kremlin, a committee aide told The Daily Beast.

Tillerson also told members and aides that he had tried to establish a formal and disciplined interagency process at the State Department whereby the president could receive informed briefings on sensitive foreign policy matters, the aide said. That effort never manifested, Tillerson told the committee, in part because of the president’s management style, but also because of interference from other aides.

Tillerson told the committee that the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at times impeded his ability to communicate effectively and introduce to President Trump policy proposals developed by State Department experts on major foreign affairs matters across the globe, not just in the Middle East. Kushner, a White House adviser, has publicly focused much of his international efforts on the Middle East and is set to unveil a Middle East peace plan in the coming weeks.

Tillerson had a notoriously prickly relationship with the president, reportedly calling him a “moron” in private. But he was present during critical moments of the administration, including Trump’s private 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany.

Since leaving his post, Tillerson has rarely made public appearances, save for speaking at a panel in Houston in December. During that appearance, he said there was “no question” Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

“So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’ and I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law,’” Tillerson said.

Tillerson’s interview by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) comes a month after special counsel Robert Mueller published his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, top Democrats on the Hill have demanded that Attorney General Bill Barr and Mueller answer questions related to the report and its publication. Barr has declined to testify before the House, citing the insistence of the committee that staff lawyers be allowed to conduct some of the questioning. Mueller is reportedly in negotiations to testify, though the Department of Justice had previously not agreed on a date for him to do so.

On Tuesday, CNN reported that Mueller’s team had expressed reluctance about the possibility of a testimony taking place in public for fear that it would appear political.

Tillerson quietly meets with House lawmakers to discuss Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/tillerson-meeting-house-foreign-affairs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson quietly met with the top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday for an interview that focused primarily on his time in the Trump administration, a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the discussion confirmed to CNN.

Tillerson traveled to Capitol Hill where he sat down with the committee's Democratic chairman Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the aide said, adding that major topics of interest included the administration's dealings with Russia and uncertainty surrounding the role of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in deciding foreign policy.

The interview lasted roughly seven hours, including breaks, the same source said.

While specific details related to the meeting remain murky, it is clear that Tillerson's trip to Capitol Hill came as a surprise to many in Washington, including to some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Several members of the House panel did not know about the interview until after it was first reported by The Daily Beast , according to a Republican lawmaker and an aide to a Democrat on the committee.

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
"DOJ, citing Barr contempt vote, threatens to cut off negotiations with Congress over Mueller report",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/doj-citing-barr-contempt-vote-threatens-to-cut-off-negotiations-with-congress-over-mueller-report,"The Justice Department warned House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff if the panel moves forward with a contempt vote or other punishment against Attorney General William Barr, it will no longer work together on a deal that would allow members to view a less-redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Schiff, D-Calif., from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, the Justice Department proposed a meeting this week with the House Intelligence panel’s senior staff to continue to search for a compromise in response to 12 requests made by the committee.

But that meeting won’t happen if the panel decides to punish Barr for failing to turn over the unredacted report, Boyd warned.

“Should the committee take the precipitous and unnecessary action of recommending a contempt finding or other enforcement action against the Attorney General, then the Department will not likely to be able to continue to work with the Committee to accommodate its interest in these materials.”

Boyd said the panel “is willing to work with the panel on a reasonable and realistic process,” to provide members with “information pertaining to counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence activities,” outlined, but redacted, in the Mueller report, which probed Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The House Judiciary Committee cited Barr with contempt earlier this month for failing to turn over the unredacted version, even though the redactions are required by law.

The Justice Department has offered a “minimally redacted” version for all members of the House Intelligence Committee to view but Democrats have declined.

Officials Dispute Mike Pompeo's Claim That Iran Is Collaborating With Al Qaeda,http://time.com,['John Walcott'],,,,http://time.com/5592889/mike-pompeo-iran-al-qaeda/,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s claim that Iran and Al Qaeda are collaborating is at best an exaggeration that is not supported by any available information, U.S. intelligence officers and officials with the State and Defense Department tell TIME.

Pompeo made the claim about the terrorist organization during testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Iran have risen.

“There is no doubt there is a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-Qaeda. Period. Full stop,” he said. “The factual question with respect to Iran’s connections to al Qaeda is very real. They have hosted al Qaeda. They have permitted al-Qaeda to transit their country.”

But U.S. officials say that he dramatically overstated the case.

“The Secretary has blown the level of collusion between Iran and a few of the remnants of al Qaeda way out of proportion,” says a senior U.S. official who follows developments in Iran closely. “There have been occasional marriages of convenience, but there is nothing in the intelligence to suggest that any of them has been consummated in any grand anti-American alliance.”

Two intelligence officials say that while it’s true that a handful of al Qaeda members, including one of Osama bin Laden’s sons, have been in Iran since shortly after the U.S. attacked their safe haven in Afghanistan in 2001, there is no evidence that Shiite Muslim Iran and the Sunni extremist group have carried out any joint operations against the U.S.

To the contrary, three officials noted, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, al Qaeda’s direct descendant in Syria and Iraq, took credit for a 2017 attack on Iran’s parliament building and the tomb of the Islamic Republic’s founder, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which according to Iran’s state media killed at least 12 people.

That attack may have been prompted by the fact that Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Shiite militias backed by Iran’s Quds Force, the overseas arms of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have battled al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said another U.S. official, who like the others requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.

“There have been al Qaeda people in Iran since shortly after 9/11, occasionally under house arrest,” says Daniel Benjamin, who was the State Department’s top counterterrorism official during the Obama Administration and now director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

However, Benjamin tells TIME, Iran has not had an operational alliance with al Qaeda.

“The Iranians want to know what AQ is up to and they keep close tabs on them, but Iran’s current approach and one it’s maintained for many years has been to avoid anything that would provoke an American strike,” he says.

The most recent State Department Country Report on Iran’s support for terrorism, published last September, doesn’t pull any punches, saying: “Iran continued to provide weapons, training, and funding to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. These Palestinian terrorist groups have been behind a number of deadly attacks originating in Gaza and the West Bank, including attacks against Israeli civilians and Egyptian security forces in the Sinai Peninsula.”

But on connections between Tehran and al Qaeda, the report says only that: “Iran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) members residing in Iran and has refused to publicly identify the members in its custody.” In addition, the clerical regime in Tehran has allowed the group to move money and fighters through Iran from Pakistan to South Asia and Syria “since at least 2009”.

However, the U.S. officials tell TIME, last summer or fall, after Pompeo became Secretary of State, language suddenly appeared referring to the few al Qaeda members as “AQ in Iran”, suggesting there was an operational cell, which the officials say was at least an exaggeration, if not an outright falsehood.

That assertion predictably has evoked memories of the George W. Bush Administration’s false claims that al Qaeda had links to Iraq, and even that bin Laden and Saddam Hussein — both Sunnis — might have cooperated in planning the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. In that case, Bush Administration officials and Iraqi exiles distorted intelligence about a supposed Iraqi terrorist training facility and an Iraqi offer to bin Laden of safe haven in Iraq, which officials neglected to mention that bin Laden had rejected, saying Iraq’s objectives were not al Qaeda’s.

There is, the U.S. officials said, slightly more substance to Pompeo’s assertion than there was to the Bush Administration’s claims about al Qaeda and Iraq, despite the centuries-old hostility between Shiite Iran and its Sunni neighbors. The small number of senior members of bin Laden’s now scattered group who remain in Iran are there with the government’s permission, although some of them have been under virtual house arrest, says one of the officials.

The arrangement, say two of the officials, is a pragmatic one: It prevents al Qaeda or any group under its wing from attacking Iran and it provides Tehran some potential leverage in any new negotiations with the U.S., although Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week said he’s not ready to talk.

“I can envision a moment when, as part of some negotiation, Iran might offer to hand over the al Qaeda types it’s been harboring in exchange for some concession on sanctions,” one U.S. diplomat tells TIME. “If you think about it, that’s kind of the opposite of what the Secretary has said.”

Now, these officials worry that the situation could spin out of control, especially after Iran this week announced that it is quadrupling it production of low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons, and on Sunday someone fired a Katyusha rocket that landed about a mile from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

Even before Iran announced the increase in uranium enrichment, Trump reversed his comment that he hoped there would not be a war with Iran and echoed National Security Advisor John Bolton’s vague threats of military action against Iran, tweeting: “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.”

Saudi Arabia, too, has been escalating its verbal attacks on its Shiite enemy, particularly in connection with the Islamic Republic’s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the Kingdom is preparing to host a meeting of Sunni allies against Iran on May 30 in Mecca.

Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan sought on Tuesday to reassure lawmakers that the Administration is not trying to start a war with Iran. But reactions to their classified briefings remained divided along party lines, with Democrats saying they are unsure of the Administration’s intentions and Republicans saying its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are succeeding.

“I don’t think anyone wants another war in the Middle East,” one of the U.S officials said on Tuesday, “but then again, nobody wanted World War I either.”

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
Tillerson meets for seven hours with House Foreign Affairs Committee,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'May At Pm']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tillerson-meets-for-seven-hours-with-democrats-on-house-foreign-affairs-panel/2019/05/21/5e5fa254-7c11-11e9-a66c-d36e482aa873_story.html,"Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson met with lawmakers for seven hours behind closed doors Tuesday to discuss his time in the Trump administration, a spokesman said.

Tillerson met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers and staffers from the House Foreign Affairs Committee after a request from Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).

“The discussion . . . covered a wide array of topics related to foreign affairs, the operations of the nation’s foreign policymaking apparatus and his tenure as Secretary of State,” according to a statement from the spokesman for Tillerson.

An official familiar with the session said Tillerson met with members and staffers separately, and that the White House knew of the testimony in advance and did not move to block it. The White House had no comment.

Among the topics discussed were Tillerson’s relationships with other White House advisers, including President Trump and his family; Trump’s interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and how policy is made in the Middle East and North Korea. He expressed some frustrations with the president’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, the official said.

Tillerson appeared voluntarily, the representative said. Tillerson’s appearance for testimony on Capitol Hill was first reported by the Daily Beast.

The former ExxonMobil chief executive had an ignominious departure from the Trump administration after he was fired by tweet in March 2018. He and the president disagreed broadly on foreign policy and had a series of fights over personnel and policy, aides to both men said.

Trump has since had a better relationship with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The president has pushed for aides not to testify in front of oversight committees, calling them Democratic efforts to undermine his administration. Tillerson has largely stayed quiet since leaving office, making few public appearances and rarely giving interviews.

In one rare interview with CBS in December, Tillerson said Trump was undisciplined, did not read or care about facts, and routinely issued directives that were against the law. Trump responded in a tweet that Tillerson was “dumb as a rock” and “lazy as hell.”"
That loose change left at airports may be used to help fund border operations,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tsa-could-use-3-million-in-loose-change-to-pay-for-dhs-backup-border-funding-plan,"The Transportation Security Administration plans to use loose change left in trays at airports to partly fund the $232 million that its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, has requested to help pay for border operations if Congress doesn’t agree to its $1.1 billion funding request.

The TSA is just one of almost two dozen agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that could be forced to dole out millions of dollars from their budgets to pay for the ramped-up operations along the United States’ southern border.

“The Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News. “We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem.”

The spokesperson added: “As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

TSA CAN NOW FORCE TRAVELERS TO TAKE FULL-BODY SCANS

According to internal TSA emails and a PowerPoint presentation from last week, which were obtained by NBC News, the agency has outlined a plan on how to handle the “tax” the DHS could levy upon it. Along with using the $3 million in loose change found in airport trays across the country, the TSA would use $50 million set aside to purchase advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set up in 2010 for injured TSA employees.

The TSA is also considering using funding for Transportation Security Officers – who run security screenings at airports – to pay the DHS in a move that could add to the already lengthy wait times for travelers at the nation’s airports during the busy summer travel season.

President Trump has asked Congress for $4.5 billion dollars to deal with the influx of migrants from Central America crossing over the U.S.’s southern border with Mexico – with $1.1 billion set aside specifically for “border operations.” The White House argues that this money will be used for “personnel expenses, additional detention beds, and operations combating human smuggling and trafficking.”

Trump’s border wall plan has been met with fierce resistance from Democrats and has become ensnared in a number of legal battles.

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

A federal judge in Oakland last week heard arguments in two lawsuits seeking to block the White House from spending money from the Defense and Treasury departments for the project. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed the other.

The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. to block the shifting of funds and construction on the wall. They want a quick decision, arguing that some of the Pentagon-funded projects could begin in eight days.

In another case, a federal judge in Washington on Thursday will consider a bid by the House to prevent Trump from spending any Defense Department money for a border wall. At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make major progress on his signature campaign promise heading into his campaign for a second term.

The president's adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress, which authorized far less wall spending than Trump wanted. Trump grudgingly accepted congressional approval of $1.375 billion to end a 35-day government shutdown on Feb. 15 and declared the emergency in almost the same breath.

The White House says it has identified up to $8.1 billion that it could spend on the project.

Trump's actions ""amount to a usurpation of Congress' legislative powers in violation of bedrock separation of powers principles embedded in the Constitution,"" the state attorneys general wrote in their lawsuit. The administration argues that Trump is protecting national security as unprecedented numbers of Central American asylum-seeking families arrive at the U.S. border.

The Defense Department has already transferred $1 billion to border wall coffers in March and another $1.5 billion last week. Patrick Shanahan, acting defense secretary, may decide as soon as Wednesday whether to transfer an additional $3.6 billion.

The DHS last week also waived environmental impact and other reviews to replace sections of wall in California and Arizona under a law that gives the secretary sweeping powers to plan construction.

Congressional Democrats — with new momentum in their legal fight to investigate President Trump’s conduct and records — are pressing Deutsche Bank for more information on a report that the firm ignored red flags about suspicious activity from the Trump and Kushner organizations. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is now a senior White House adviser.

The development brings even more political heat to the only major financial firm willing to bank Trump over the past two decades as he suffered a series of bankruptcies and defaults — and which still holds $300 million in outstanding debt from the now-president. Deutsche Bank also faced enormous fines — $700 million in 2017 alone — for money laundering and misconduct on behalf of clients. Its shares hit a record low on Monday.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee plan to press the issue with federal financial regulators at a hearing today. Ohio's Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the panel, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) set the stage in a Monday letter to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking for details about events described in a New York Times report from Sunday.

That story alleges that over 2016 and 2017, Deutsche’s in-house anti-money-laundering experts recommended passing suspicious transactions involving Trump and Kushner-controlled entities along to the Treasury Department for further investigation. But executives in the bank’s private wealth management division buried the reports instead.

Brown plans to lead off his questioning today of the Treasury Department’s top financial crimes enforcer and the FBI’s section chief for financial crimes by highlighting the report.

“We need to get to the bottom of what happened here,” Brown will say, according to a copy of his opening statement shared with The Finance 202. “Everyone has to follow anti-money laundering laws and rules — you don’t get an exemption if you have a rich and powerful client. And we have to hold financial institutions accountable if they break the rules.”

And House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) last month subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records relating to its extensive dealings with Trump, did not have a comment by press time.

Democratic lawmakers have some wind at their backs as they press their case. A federal judge on Monday blocked Trump’s bid to kill another House subpoena — this one to his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for years of his financial records. In a forceful ruling, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote it is “not for the court to question whether the [House Oversight and Reform] Committee’s actions are truly motivated by political considerations,” and declined a request from Trump’s lawyers to stay his order for more than seven days.

Trump criticized the ruling:

A federal judge in Manhattan could follow suit Wednesday when he holds a hearing on a similar attempt by the Trump team to block House subpoenas of Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump’s lawyers have made the same argument there that fell short in the Mazars case: That Democratic lawmakers behind the document demands are motivated by improper political considerations.

(Still, House Democratic leaders are divided over how, broadly, to approach attempting to hold Trump to account. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) faced down a number of her lieutenants eager to begin impeachment proceedings in a heated Monday night meeting, after the White House blocked former counsel Don McGahn from testifying to the House.)

The New York Times report prompted an angry response from Trump on Monday — but not over the story’s central claim that Deutsche Bank overlooked potentially shady transactions involving Trump entities. He bristled rather at the story’s statement that the German bank has been the only major financial firm willing to extend him credit:

....fashioned, but true. When you don’t need or want money, you don’t need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage, and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don’t even exist)...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2019

.....was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn’t like them, I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money. Fake News! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2019

The New York Times reporter who wrote the Deutsche Bank piece challenged Trump's claim:

This is not true. I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US. https://t.co/Qh4siSpEgM — David Enrich (@davidenrich) May 20, 2019

Trump's tweet thread belongs to a tradition of defensive comments about his net worth, as The Post's Catherine Rampell points out. ""One theory is that, maybe, if Trump’s tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he’s not nearly as rich as he says,” she writes. “Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up. Of course, both explanations could be true.”

For its part, Deutsche Bank released a statement Monday denying the Times report. “At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false,” the bank said.

It’s worth noting, however, that the whistleblower at the heart of the Times story never made the first claim the denial addresses. Rather, she says, she presented her best case for submitting a report to Treasury on the suspicious activity she uncovered, but senior executives with the bank’s private banking division decided against her recommendation.

Now, Congressional Democrats intend to pick up where those executives left off.

TRADE FLY-AROUND:

U.S. action against Chinese tech giant Huawei last week may have further harmed the state of trade talks, but an announcement Monday evening might cool some tensions. (Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg News)

— China talks stall: Both the U.S. and China appear to be digging in for a prolonged trade war. To review: Since Trump and his administration accused China of backing away from a deal, the United States has doubled tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports; China has promised to retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods by June 1; the United States is considering imposing tariffs on all remaining approximately $300 billion in Chinese imports not currently taxed; and at the end of last week, it sought to blacklist Huawei, one of China’s leading technology companies. Meanwhile, the promise of talks have fizzled.

China tells Washington to cool it: Frustrated with the moves against Huawei, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday to tell the United States to not “go too far,” the state-run Xinhua reported.

What deal?: After Trump repeated Sunday that China walked away from a deal, China said the president was mistaken. “We don’t know what this agreement is the United States is talking about,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters on Monday. “Perhaps the United States has an agreement they all along had extravagant expectations for, but it’s certainly not a so-called agreement that China agreed to.”

Beijing has also denied knowing anything of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s desire to come to China to resume negotiations.

David Dollar, senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, broke down for Brent why he thinks the two sides are still so far away from a deal.

The stalemate: “The U.S. would like all of [trade demands] codified in laws passed by the National People’s Congress, and the Chinese prefer to implement through State Council regulations which have status of law in China,"" Dollar said. ""Also, the Chinese want the U.S. to pull back on all the tariffs they’ve aimed at China, and the U.S. would like to leave all of them or at least most of them in place until the U.S. sees Chinese implementation. So frankly, they are very far apart.""

So frankly, they are very far apart."" How could China respond?: “I think it is extremely unlikely that China in some sense would cave in and agree to everything that the U.S. is asking. I just find that inconceivable and the Chinese seem to be digging in for a long trade war,"" he said. ""I think the Chinese have been very consistent: they are willing to make a deal, they are willing to compromise.”

I just find that inconceivable and the Chinese seem to be digging in for a long trade war,"" he said. ""I think the Chinese have been very consistent: they are willing to make a deal, they are willing to compromise.” Trump and Xi at G-20: “To me, it seems impossible that they would have worked out a deal that those two could then ratify, so I think the best case scenario is that the two have a good meeting and maybe each of their economies is deteriorating in the background and then they to agree to tell their negotiators to make a compromise, find an agreement.”

… But while prospects with China sour, USMCA talks are looking slightly more promising. Trump announced on Friday that the United States would lift its steel and aluminum tariffs, which Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had said was necessary before the Senate Finance Committee that he chairs moved forward on the New NAFTA.

Not so fast: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) said after the announcement that House Democrats “continue to have a number of substantial concerns” about the new NAFTA deal.

Canada has a limited window to act: As Vox’s Jen Kirby reports, “Canada has a short window to pass the USMCA this year — its Parliament adjourns June 21, after which everyone will head home to campaign for federal elections in October.” Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the lifting of the tariffs means it’s “full steam ahead,” per Reuters’s Steve Scherer. Freeland also said she would be contacting Democrats to talk about their concerns.

POCKET CHANGE

— Justice Department reportedly leaning against T-Mobile takeover: “The Justice Department is leaning against approving T-Mobile U.S. Inc.’s proposed takeover of Sprint Corp., according to a person familiar with the review, even after the companies won the backing of the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,” Bloomberg News’s David McLaughlin reports.

“Opposition to the deal by the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, would mark a rare break with the FCC. The two agencies work side by side on merger reviews and typically emerge on the same page about whether to approve deals.”

— Ford to cut 10 percent of global workforce: “Ford Motor Co. will cut roughly 10 percent of its global salaried staff by August as part of a companywide “redesign,” the company told employees Monday,” my colleague Rachel Siegel reports. “The move will eliminate 7,000 white-collar jobs and save the U.S. auto giant about $600 million a year.”

“The cuts represent the latest phase of Ford’s global restructuring, meant to make the company more agile and less bureaucratic in the face of industry tumult that has forced carmakers to pivot away from sedans and shutter plants nationwide.”

MONEY ON THE HILL

— Top four congressional leaders head to the White House: “The four top party leaders will meet on Tuesday morning to begin talks on a potential deal to raise the budget caps, as well as a possible boost to the debt ceiling, according to multiple sources, although any agreement will be hard to reach,” Politico’s John Bresnahan and Heather Caygle report. “Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will attend the session, as well as their top aides.”

“Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will take the lead for the Trump administration in the negotiations, the sources added. Without action by Congress and the White House, the Pentagon faces a cut of $71 billion under current law, while domestic programs would be slashed $55 billion.”

— Harris announces gender pay gap plan: “Senator Kamala Harris of California on Monday announced a proposal to close the gender wage gap by requiring larger companies to certify that men and women are paid equally, in an effort to combat wage discrimination on a federal level,” the New York Times’s Astead W. Herndon reports.

“Unlike previous federal legislation regarding the pay gap, which asked workers to report or sue their employer if discrepancies were suspected, Ms. Harris’s plan would proactively force companies with 100 or more employees to obtain an “equal pay certification” every two years, showing that they were paying men and women the same for analogous work, her campaign said.”

— Crowley, Daschle join cannabis company board: “Northern Swan Holdings Inc., an investment firm betting on hemp and marijuana cultivation in Colombia, has enlisted a pair of former Democratic lawmakers as it tries to navigate complicated cannabis regulations around the globe,” Bloomberg News’s Craig Giammona reports. “Joe Crowley, a former high-ranking New York congressman who lost a primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last year, and Tom Daschle, a former U.S. Senate majority leader from South Dakota, have joined Northern Swan’s advisory board, the latest politicians to jump into the legal cannabis industry.”

THE REGULATORS

— Regulators leave almost half their fines uncollected. WSJ's Dave Michaels: ""Wall Street watchdogs often tout the fines they levy on alleged wrongdoers. Yet much of that money is never collected. The Securities and Exchange Commission over five fiscal years that ended in September 2018 took in 55% of the $20 billion in enforcement fines set through settlements or court judgments, according to agency statistics. During the prior five years, from 2009 through 2013, the SEC collected on 60% of $14.6 billion...

""The SEC has struggled for years to get defendants to pay their fines, although some are almost certain to avoid payment forever... The SEC’s challenge is that, like companies that are owed money, it doesn’t have the right to seize a debtor’s property or assets to extract payment. Instead, it relies on a time-consuming and litigious process of filing liens against defendants or going to court to seek contempt orders.""

Justice Department willing to hand over counterintelligence if Schiff backs off 'enforcement action',https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/justice-department-doj-counterintelligence-adam-schiff/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is trying to stave off an ""enforcement action"" against Attorney General William Barr this week, making a rare offer to have the House Intelligence Committee review materials from special counsel Robert Mueller's report if House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff agrees to back down.

Last week Schiff said that he would hold a business meeting Wednesday to take an unspecified action against the Justice Department for not providing the committee documents related to Volume I of Mueller's report on links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

The Justice Department had previously offered to show all committee members a less redacted version of the Mueller report, but now says it's continuing to review the initial tranche of 12 categories of documents Schiff wants, and will make them available ""in relatively short order,"" according to a letter obtained by CNN.

""The Department has already begun the process of identifying, locating and reviewing the materials potentially responsive to the categories of documents,"" Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote Tuesday, ""a process that will not continue should the Committee take the unnecessary and unproductive step of moving to hold the Attorney General in contempt.""

Boyd's letter also confirms that last week's offer of having all members of the House Intelligence Committee review the less redacted version of the Mueller report remains on the table -- and it now extends to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

DHS has 'strong concerns' Chinese-made drones stealing data,https://www.channel3000.com,['David Shortell'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/national-news/dhs-has-strong-concerns-chinesemade-drones-stealing-data/1079687408,"Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

The warning from DHS follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that effectively banned US firms from using telecommunications equipment made by the Chinese company Huawei, which has drawn similar national security concerns of government spying.

The US and China are currently locked in a trade war that has frayed the two countries' relationship as it deteriorated in recent weeks.

US officials have raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones in the past. In 2017, the US Army issued a ban the use of DJI drones, alleging in a memo that the company shared critical infrastructure and law enforcement data with the Chinese government.

Also that year, an internal report from an intelligence division of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency in Los Angeles assessed that DJI was ""selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within (the US. critical infrastructure and law enforcement sectors) to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive US data.""

Users are warned to ""be cautious when purchasing"" drones from China, and to take precautionary steps like turning off the device's internet connection and removing secure digital cards.

The alert also warns users to ""understand how to properly operate and limit your device's access to networks"" to avoid ""theft of information.""

""Organizations that conduct operations impacting national security or the Nation's critical functions must remain especially vigilant as they may be at greater risk of espionage and theft of proprietary information,"" the alert states.

In a statement, DJI said that it gives customers ""full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted,"" adding that ""customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends.""

""At DJI, safety is at the core of everything we do, and the security of our technology has been independently verified by the U.S. government and leading U.S. businesses,"" DJI said.

""For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends. Every day, American businesses, first responders, and U.S. government agencies trust DJI drones to help save lives, promote worker safety, and support vital operations, and we take that responsibility very seriously,"" DJI said.

DJI, which reported $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, is best known for its popular Phantom drone. Introduced in 2013, the drone is the top-selling commercial drone on the market.

Seventy-nine percent of drones operating in the US and Canada and 74% globally are made by DJI, according to a 2018 market sector report from Skylogic Research, an industry analyst.

Industry experts say the drone's easy-to-use software combined with sophisticated cameras and advanced technology allowed DJI to take over sales in the US for hobbyists, as well as professional organizations.

Biden would beat Trump in Pennsylvania despite president's 2016 win: Donna Brazile,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-would-beat-trump-in-pennsylvania-despite-presidents-2016-triumph-in-the-state-over-hillary-clinton-donna-brazile,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to win back a key battleground state for the Democratic Party that President Trump took in 2016, according to ex-DNC Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.

Brazile, speaking during an interview on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday, said Biden would be able to make up the less than one percentage point Trump won by in Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“Look, I think it’s going to be a close election across the country. But, Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania by less than 50,000 votes,"" she said.

""Joe Biden will be able to make that up. But, not just Joe Biden—any one of the Democrats I think can be very competitive in the Keystone State.”

TRUMP, AT RAUCOUS PENNSYLVANIA RALLY, SLAMS SCRANTON-BORN BIDEN: 'HE DESERTED YOU'

Brazile’s comments follow a fiery rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Monday night where the president hit hard at Biden.

As he was ending his speech, Trump told a packed crowd, “Don’t forget: Biden deserted you. He’s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please.”

Biden served as a Senator from Delaware for over 30 years but was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

""This guy talks about 'I know Scranton,'"" Trump said. ""Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you.""

JOE BIDEN TELLS YOUNG ACTIVISTS HE STARTED PUSH TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN 1987

Brazile countered, “He’s well known in Pennsylvania and he’s not the forgotten son. He is the forgotten hero.”

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week shows Biden beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania 53 to 42. Additionally, according to a report from Politico using what it said was the Trump campaign’s internal polling, Biden is also ahead in two more highly contested states: Wisconsin and Michigan.

However, both Biden and the president will face a packed field in 2020 with 22 other Democratic candidates now in the running and a long road still ahead.

“The one thing you can give Joe Biden credit [for] is he understands the electorate and he wants to win,” said Brazile. “But, again, he has to get through the Democratic primary...Joe Biden has got to not only maintain his lead, but he has to expand his appeal to voters who might not be familiar with his record as well as voters who might want to see a different face in the White House in 2020.”

"U.S. Corn Planting Is Waaaaaaaaaaaaay Behind, USDA says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/us-corn-planting-is-waaaaaaaaaaaaay-behind-usda-says,"Corn

DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers have the most corn acres left to plant, on this date, than they have ever had and remain behind the trade’s expectations, as well.

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 49% complete, behind the 80% five-year average.

The trade expected a completion rating of 53%. On this week of the planting season, the most that U.S. farmers have ever had left was 47% of the crop. In 2019, that amount is 51%, with plenty of rain in the Midwest’s forecast.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 70% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 89% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 24% of their corn seeded, behind a 89% five-year average. Indiana has 14% planted vs. a 73% five-year average. In the eastern Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 70% of their corn planted vs. a 86% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 49% five-year average.

I'm the same age as Elizabeth Warren. We 70-somethings have no business being president.,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Bonnie Goldstein', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/05/21/2020-election-warren-biden-trump-sanders-age-column/3742249002/,"CLOSE

I have nothing against old people — I'm one of them. But maybe it's time to add a maximum age limit to our minimum age requirement for our presidents.

Next month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.

That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.

The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.

You don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign

I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.

Growing up in the analogue era

In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures (for example, in 1970, I moved to a beach in Sinaloa, Mexico, instead of going to college). As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D.C., with a grown-up career.

President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.

It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, ""the sky was the limit.""

Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn’t go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.

While not everyone’s history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today’s spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.

Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D.C., in Burlington, Vermont Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).

Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders’ similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, “bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier.”

This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman’s humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist “vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the … suffocating force of the status quo.”

Business values of the 1980s

While Sanders was stewing over the meaning of his life in the mid-1980s, 300 miles south, Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4.5 million a year from his father’s clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.

Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for “getting even.”

President Donald Trump speaks to the media in Washington on May 14. 2019. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE)

Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1.17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.

In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were “entitled to massive write-offs,"" and ""you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes."" Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common “sport” among real estate developers.

Thanks to my generation’s harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That’s as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.

The future might rest on electing a sufficiently “woke” candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.

Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I’ll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.

For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

On Monday, he said the two companies need to build up adequate capital before they can be privatized, which means that the sweeps of extra profits from Fannie and Freddie into the U.S. Treasury would have to end. He gave no time horizon for when that would happen.

He said that common shareholders are part of the discussions. Existing shareholders could see their stakes shrink if the GSEs issue and sell new shares to build up the capital needed.

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least.

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

In modern times, presidents have rarely been church mice afraid of a little salty language. But President Donald Trump has grown increasingly willing in recent months to say in public what most of his predecessors tried to keep behind closed doors.

His is the profanity presidency, full of four-letter denunciations of his enemies and earthy dismissals of allegations lodged against him. At rallies and in interviews, on Twitter and in formal speeches, he relishes the bad-boy language of a shock jock, just one more way of gleefully provoking the political establishment bothered by his norm-shattering ways.

In a single speech on Friday alone, he managed to throw out a “hell,” an “ass” and a couple of “bullshits” for good measure. In the course of just one rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, earlier this month, he tossed out 10 “hells,” three “damns” and a “crap.” The audiences did not seem to mind. They cheered and whooped and applauded.

“I’d say swearing is part of his appeal,” said Melissa Mohr, the author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing,” published in 2013. “It helps create the impression that he is saying what he thinks, ‘telling it like it is.’ We tend to believe people when they swear, because we interpret these words as a sign of strong emotions. In his case, the emotion is often powerful anger, which his supporters seem to love.”

While traditionalists may deem it unpresidential and a poor example for children, Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime scholar of presidential communication, said gritty language was part of the show put on by Trump, the onetime reality television entertainer, for his fans.

“He knows they like him to use words that lie over the edge of the traditional boundary of presidential decorum,” she said. “His controversial word choices are an aspect of his role as the disrupter he promised his constituents he would be.”

But critics say the vulgarity comes at a cost. “No one has debased the civil discourse in this country more than President Trump, and the president really does set the tone in the country,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “We see it reflected in our offices by the hateful, belligerent, obscene and violent calls that we get now that we didn’t used to get.”

Schiff has experienced it personally when Trump turned his name into a profanity last fall by nicknaming him “little Adam Schitt.” Schiff said, “The last time that happened, the person who did that had their mouth washed out with soap by his mother.”

An unscientific survey seems to suggest that if anything, Trump is growing more comfortable with crudeness. He used the word “bullshit” in public just once in his first two years in office, according to the Factba.se database that tracks his speeches, but on four occasions in the last three months.

He has either coarsened the public discourse or reflected it, or perhaps both, depending on your view of him, but he is not alone. Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the BS word just 14 times in the many years before Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joe Biden, was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”

Any restraint Trump may have sought to exhibit early in his term seems to have eroded in recent months. In a January interview with The Times, he boasted that he had “beat the shit out of” Republican rivals in 2016. A month later, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that his enemies were trying to take him out “with bullshit.”

A few weeks later, he told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that Democrats were peddling “ridiculous bullshit” about him. In April, he said some statements in the special counsel report were “total bullshit.” Last week, he retweeted a post by his son Eric Trump saying that under Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor now running for president, “our great city has gone to shit.”

By the time the president took the stage before the National Association of Realtors in Washington on Friday, he was in a feisty mood.

He recalled that a consultant tried to make work for himself by identifying environmental concerns on a property Trump wanted to develop. “I fired his ass so fast,” the president recalled.

He told the Realtors that he used to refuse to pay brokers their traditional 6 percent commission and instead gave them just 1 percent. “I was famous for that,” he said. When they booed, he quickly retreated. “Don’t worry. Nobody accepted it. But I tried like hell.”

Then he went after one of his favorite targets — journalists — claiming that recent reports of infighting within his national security team were made up. “There is no source,” he said. “The person doesn’t exist. The person’s not alive. It’s bullshit, OK? It’s bullshit.”

DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."

I.R.S. Memo Undercuts Mnuchin on Withholding Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/irs-memo-trump-taxes.html,"At a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Mnuchin said that he has had multiple conversations with Mr. Rettig and with the lawyers at the I.R.S. about the legal issues surrounding the request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns. The Treasury secretary said that Mr. Rettig agreed with the decision not to release them to Congress.

Mr. Mnuchin is expected to testify on Wednesday morning before the House Financial Services Committee and is likely to be grilled by Democrats about the decision not to hand over the returns.

Mr. Trump broke decades of precedent by not releasing his tax returns while running for president, claiming that he could not do so because he was under audit by the I.R.S. There are no laws preventing taxpayers from releasing their returns while under audit.

Last month, Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, used an obscure provision of the tax code to try to obtain the financial papers. Mr. Neal said the information was needed so that the committee could review how the I.R.S. conducts presidential audits.

The Treasury Department declined that request, prompting Mr. Neal to issue a subpoena to try to force Mr. Mnuchin to furnish the returns. Mr. Mnuchin again refused last week, saying that the matter would be settled by the courts.

Although the I.R.S. memo was never finalized, it highlights the administration’s attempt to deal with an unusual request, one that has placed Mr. Mnuchin, a staunch Trump ally, in the middle of a legal war over the president’s personal financial information.

John Koskinen, the former I.R.S. commissioner, said that it was conceivable that career staff in the agency’s legal department drafted the memo and that it was buried because it was clear that the conclusion would be unacceptable to the White House. He said that he would be surprised if the leadership of the I.R.S. and Treasury was not aware of such a document because the issue is so politically sensitive.

“It would be stunning to me if either Rettig or Mnuchin said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know about that,’” Mr. Koskinen said."

"Venezuela opposition's envoy to U.S. meets Pentagon, State Department officials",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-usa/venezuela-oppositions-envoy-to-us-meets-pentagon-state-department-officials-idUSKCN1SQ26G,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Venezuelan opposition’s envoy to the United States said he met Pentagon and State Department officials in Washington on Monday to discuss “all aspects of the Venezuelan crisis.”

Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido’s ambassador to Washington, said in a message on Twitter that the talks held at the State Department had been “very positive” but offered no further details. “We continue to advance,” he said.

The talks were arranged at the request of Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

The United States and many European and Latin American countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader. But Maduro retains control of state functions and the support of the military’s top brass, as well as allies such as Russia, Cuba and China.

The purpose of Monday’s meeting was to discuss the U.S. Defense Department’s “past and future role related to humanitarian assistance and regional support,” a State Department official said ahead of the talks.

President Donald Trump and senior aides have not ruled out military action in the crisis-stricken South American country, repeatedly saying that “all options are on the table.”

But Washington has made clear it prefers to exert continued economic and diplomatic pressure to push Maduro out, and many experts have said the U.S. use of military force is unlikely."

Contributing columnist

The Office of Legal Counsel offered more cause for concern last week that politics is playing an undue role at the Justice Department. The office, which is charged with providing the executive branch neutral legal advice, issued an opinion that the Food and Drug Administration has no authority to regulate drugs used in lethal injection.

The OLC opinion was clearly designed to break through the legal logjam that has prevented states from using lethal injection drugs in executions — and it uses Evel Kneivel-style logical leaps to get there.

Lethal injections, such as the three-drug cocktail sodium thiopental, have become the primary method of execution in the United States. Of the 292 executions in the last 10 years, 289 have employed such chemicals.

U.S. drug manufacturers, not wanting their products to be associated with executions, stopped making thiopental 10 years ago, forcing states to acquire the killing drugs overseas. This move has generated legal trouble, however, as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits misbranded drugs from entering interstate commerce, including any drug not manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA. The statute also prohibits the use of an unapproved new drug that the FDA has not blessed as safe and effective for its proposed use.

Based on these legal provisions, a group of convicts on death row sued the FDA in 2011 and gained an injunction requiring the administration to prevent the entry of foreign-manufactured thiopental on the grounds that it was unapproved and misbranded. It also had to tell state correctional departments that the use of the drug was prohibited by law under threat of civil and criminal penalties.

That injunction remains in effect today. Among other things, it has put the FDA and death-penalty states such as Texas at loggerheads.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion, authored by its well-respected head lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, attempts to take the FDA’s foot off the throat of death-penalty states. Engel points to FDA v. Brown & Williamson, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court found that the FDA lacks regulatory authority over tobacco products as “drugs” or “devices” (Congress later granted the agency power to regulate them directly), to argue that the FDA similarly cannot regulate sodium thiopental’s use in executions. The supposition is that when used for executions, the substance is intended to kill the prisoner, so by definition the drug is not “safe” or “effective.”

But this reasoning is tendentious. Nowhere in Brown & Williamson did the court suggest that the law inherently did not cover tobacco products; rather, the court held that, lacking any safer effective use, the FDA could only regulate the products by banning them, which Congress expressly forbade. Congress has not, however, forbidden the FDA from banning the use of sodium thiopental in executions.

The OLC opinion tries to get around this problem by lumping sodium thiopental in with other means of executions — electric chairs, gallows or firing squads — that “are intended to affect the function or structure of the body,” which is one of the definitions of a “drug.” Thus, Engel argues, the FDA would have to ban all means of execution, whereas “the Constitution and laws of the United States presuppose the continued availability of capital punishment.”

This is a massive logical leap. Among other problems, it assumes that there cannot be a “safe and effective” drug in executions, but the whole point of lethal injection is to provide a safe and effective form of execution — not, of course, to extend life but to promote a humane and predictable death rather than the ghoulish lottery of untested, potentially painful drugs.

Moreover, all the opinions in the litigation that resulted in the 2011 injunction, as well as previous opinions in the Supreme Court, concluded that the FDA’s jurisdiction over drugs extends to sodium thiopental. Even Texas expressly conceded it in the injunction litigation. The OLC opinion also sidesteps the immense implications of its reasoning for the FDA’s regulation of drugs for physician-assisted suicide, animal euthanasia or recreation.

So why would OLC issue such a strained opinion? First clue: The heading of the opinion makes clear that it was ordered up by the attorney general, which is relatively rare. And a footnote states that OLC “considered” the views of the FDA. Reading between the lines, it’s a decent bet that OLC rejected the FDA’s arguments.

Apart from disarming the FDA, the opinion removes the threat of civil and even criminal liability under the FDCA for state officials who buy and use the foreign-manufactured drugs.

Finally, the OLC opinion could potentially serve as the basis for a motion to dissolve or amend the 2011 injunction. Death penalty states could argue to the court that the FDA’s jurisdiction is a threshold issue not previously considered, and the opinion here, being an official statement of the executive branch, would carry more weight than a simple argument in a brief.

None of this would be so worrisome if the opinion represented the sort of nonpartisan legal interpretation that the OLC is charged with providing. But the opinion, not least because of its dubious legal analysis, bears the distinct scent of a preferred political solution. Given the concern that the Justice Department has become a political tool for the administration, it’s yet another worrisome indication that the norms of our institutions are eroding.

Homeland Security warns of scam that uses real law enforcement numbers,https://kstp.com,[],,,,https://kstp.com/news/homeland-security-warns-scam-uses-real-law-enforcement-phone-numbers-dhs/5361377/,"According to the release, the perpetrator starts by befriending victims on a mobile app for chatting, such as Facebook Messenger or Words with Friends, and feigns romantic interest in the victim through dating services or chat rooms. After gaining the victim's trust, the perpetrator describes a minor hardship and persuades the victim to sent them a small amount of money.

The release says a fraudster then calls the victim the following day, claiming to be an employee of DHS or another law enforcement agency. DHS says the fraudsters spoof the caller ID of legitimate law enforcement phone numbers, and tells the victim the funds they sent the day before went to a criminal organization or terrorist group, such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and threatens them with arrest and imprisonment.

The fraudsters then direct the victim to contact a ""lawyer"" who can help them, and the ""lawyer"" then instructs the victim to pay $1,000 or more as a ""retainer.""

DHS says the Office of Inspector General is investigating the situation, but reminds the public that law enforcement and other government agency phone numbers may be used by the fraudsters in the scam. The release warns people to not provide any personal information when receiving calls from these numbers.

The release says people should remember that legitimate law enforcement callers will never ask you to pay fines over the phone or request money from you. If you question the validity of the call, you're urged to call the relevant field office number of the agency that called and ask to be put in touch with the individual who called you.

If you believe you may have been a victim of this scam, DHS urges you to call its hotline at 1-800-323-8603 or file a complaint online at oig.dhs.gov."
Two Top Treasury Officials Promoted to New Posts,https://www.wsj.com,['Kate Davidson'],,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-top-treasury-officials-promoted-to-new-posts-11558455128,"President Trump intends to promote the Treasury Department’s top lawyer to the position of its top financial diplomat, the White House said Monday.

Mr. Trump will nominate Brent McIntosh, the agency’s general counsel, to become the undersecretary for international affairs, the job vacated by David Malpass when he took over as the head of the World Bank in April.

The White House said Brian Callanan, the Treasury’s deputy general counsel, would be nominated to the general counsel’s job.

Mr. McIntosh will join a handful of Treasury officials whose nominations to higher positions are pending before the Senate.

Geoffrey Okamoto, who previously served as deputy assistant secretary for international finance, has effectively been filling the role of assistant secretary since his nomination in January. Brian McGuire, nominated in February to be a deputy under secretary for legislative affairs, joined the agency in January as a counselor.

Also awaiting Senate confirmation are Michael Faulkender, nominated last year be assistant secretary for economic policy, and Bimal Patel, Mr. Trump’s nominee to be assistant secretary for financial institutions.

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has lost a number of top deputies in recent months, further diminishing the upper ranks of an agency juggling some of the Trump administration’s top economic policy priorities, including trade negotiations, international sanctions and regulatory overhauls.

Craig Phillips, the driving force behind the Trump administration’s effort to revamp Wall Street oversight, told staff last week that he will leave the agency next month to go back to the private sector. Heath Tarbert, Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial markets, was nominated earlier this year to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Eli Miller, Mr. Mnuchin’s chief of staff, left the agency last month, and Tony Sayegh, Treasury’s top spokesman, is expected to leave after the G-20 meeting in June. Monica Crowley, a longtime Fox News commentator, joined the agency last week and will fill Mr. Sayegh’s role when he departs.

“When you have a fully staffed organization and a few key aides leave, it creates new room for new people to become key aides,” said Aaron Klein, a former Obama Treasury official and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “When you have an understaffed organization and a few key people leave, there’s nobody there to immediately step up.”

The Treasury general counsel is at the center of a fight over congressional access to Mr. Trump’s tax returns. Treasury also faces a slew of requests from House Democrats for details related to Mr. Trump’s potential business conflicts of interest.

Mr. McIntosh served as a White House lawyer from 2006 to 2009, first as an associate counsel to President George W. Bush and later as deputy assistant to the president and deputy staff secretary. Prior to that, he worked for the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Policy. Before joining the Trump administration, he was a partner at the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell.

Mr. Callanan previously served as a staff director and general counsel for the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and as general counsel to Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio). Prior to joining the Treasury Department he was a partner at the law firm Cooper & Kirk.

"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Utah Gov. Herbert to meet over roadless rule",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900071458/agriculture-secretary-sonny-perdue-utah-gov-herbert-to-meet-over-roadless-rule.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is coming to Utah this week and will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss multiple issues, including the state's desire for a roadless rule specific to Utah and the formalization of a stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service.

Herbert and Perdue will spend most of the day together Wednesday, kicking things off with a meeting, talks over breakfast, a Tooele County tour of a watershed restoration project, lunch and a tour of Welfare Square operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As head of the agriculture department, Perdue oversees the management of the nation's forests. In Utah, there are 8.1 million forested acres, of which more than 4 million are designated and managed as roadless.

The 2001 Roadless Rule, according to the U.S. Forest Service, establishes prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on 58.5 million acres of inventoried forest lands across the country.

Utah is following the lead of Alaska, which in 2018 successfully received approval of its petition to the U.S. Forest Service for the agency to begin developing a specific roadless rule plan for the Tongass National Forest.

Any new rule or update requires an environmental review process, and the state's petition to change what is on the books has prompted outcry and objection from multiple organizations.

In a briefing to lawmakers last week, the head of the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Kathleen Clarke, said Utah's petition was submitted at the end of February and is awaiting action by the U.S. Forest Service.

Perdue's visit is a good sign, she added, in her presentation to the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Interim Committee.

“I think it is a very solid petition,"" Clarke said. ""There is a lot of rumor out there. There are a lot of accusations of it taking over management, which it does not do,"" she said.

Utah's desire for the roadless rule alteration comes in the aftermath of a record-breaking wildfire season in 2018 that cost the state more than $42 million in funding to quell.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The Dollar Ridge Fire continues to burn at Strawberry Reservoir on Friday, July 6, 2018.

In a video presented to the legislative committee, Clarke's office detailed the specific motivation for seeking a Utah specific rule, citing the need to update the 18-year-old management structure that fails to keep pace with modern challenges of drought, climate change and rampant insect infestation killing millions of trees.

""Utah is not scheming to put more roads in forests,"" the narrator said, adding it is only asking for an updated rule that encompasses Utah's conditions that may differ from the rest of the nation.

But there are plenty of critics who say Utah's move for a modification of the rule is unnecessary and suspect, prompting some to threaten lawsuits or lobby personally in Washington, D.C.

Trout Unlimited sent Andy Rasmussen, the organization's Utah coordinator of the Sportsmen's Conservation Project, and Heidi Lewis, chairwoman of the Women's Initiative Council, and others to the nation's capital on Friday to press its case on keeping the current roadless rule intact.

""Trout Unlimited feels like it should not change and that we can work things out with programs already in place,"" Lewis said. ""Ultimately if you put roads in, you can't remove them.""

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Linda Adams looks at the damage after the Dollar Ridge Fire in Fruitland on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The fire destroyed her home, shed and camper.

Lewis added that Utah's prized Blue Ribbon fisheries would be threatened via changes to the roadless rule management.

The group met personally with Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and staffers with other members of Utah's delegation.

""It was surprisingly positive,"" he said. ""They are definitely open to a path forward that does not include"" a revision of the rule, Rasmussen said, stressing that Utah's petition is especially concerning because it is so vague.

Rasmussen added the organization believes a better solution, and less costly one, would be an administrative agreement between Utah and the Forest Service, rather than wholesale makeover of the rule.

""I am with the governor on the goals as far as forest health and resiliency,"" he said, but added there should be an agreement that ""maintains the integrity of the roadless rule and still addresses (Utah) concerns.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Heidi Lewis as Heidi Rasmussen."
State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

There's a huge loophole in a new DOJ filing that Trump cited to block Don McGahn from testifying before Congress,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/justice-department-olc-memo-don-mcgahn-2019-5,"The White House announced on Monday that President Donald Trump instructed the former White House counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony related to the Russia investigation.

In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to a new memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel ""stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly.""

Indeed, the memo said, ""Congress may not constitutionally compel the President's senior advisers to testify about their official duties.""

But legal experts were quick to point out the opinion doesn't account for one important possibility: McGahn choosing to testify before lawmakers.

Read more: White House officials asked Don McGahn to publicly say Trump didn't obstruct justice after they saw Mueller's report

'McGahn does NOT have to comply with Trump's instruction'

""The key here is what the OLC opinion does not say — that McGahn can be barred from voluntarily testifying before Congress,"" Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, wrote on Twitter. ""All it says on that front is that he can't be punished for refusing to testify (Part IV), not that the President has any means of stopping him from doing so.""

""Whether or not the OLC opinion is correct that McGahn can't be punished for refusing to testify (which is the weakest part of the analysis, in my view), there's nothing in these 15 pages that remotely supports the idea that McGahn can somehow be 'blocked from testifying,'"" Vladeck added.

Eric Columbus, who served as senior counsel to the deputy attorney general under former President Barack Obama, echoed that view, tweeting, ""McGahn does NOT have to comply with Trump's instruction.""

The OLC memo said, ""Coercing senior presidential advisers into situations where they must repeatedly decline to provide answers, citing executive privilege, would be inefficient and contrary to good-faith governance.""

But ""executive privilege has no force against a former employee who wants to testify,"" Columbus tweeted.

Read more:The FBI's former top lawyer said Mueller's obstruction findings are 'alarming' and show a 'pattern of corruption'

He also said McGahn cannot assert attorney-client privilege in refusing to testify because the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled that there is no attorney-client privilege between the White House counsel and the president.

But McGahn does have an incentive to comply with Trump's order

But several observers said McGahn has incentive to comply with Trump's order, even if he isn't legally required to. McGahn is a prominent player in Republican political circles, and defying the White House could not only put his own career at risk but also prompt the president and his allies to urge others to boycott McGahn's law firm, Jones Day.

Indeed, McGahn has walked a tightrope since the special counsel Robert Mueller's final report in the Russia investigation was released. Though prosecutors did not make a decision on whether Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice, the document laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence against the president, much of which came from McGahn when he testified for over 30 hours to Mueller's office.

Trump and his lawyers promptly attacked McGahn's credibility and accused him of falsifying his testimony. Though McGahn's lawyer said in a statement that what his client told Mueller was true — and backed up by corroborating evidence — he emphasized that ""Don, nonetheless, appreciates that the President gave him the opportunity to serve as White House Counsel, and assist him with his signature accomplishments.""

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, highlighted how McGahn is likely to comply with Trump's order.

The probable solution, he added, is that ""Democrats will have to hold him in contempt and then go to court to compel his testimony."""
USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
Ken Cuccinelli expected to be named to DHS for top immigration role,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kaitlan Collins', 'Jeremy Diamond']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/ken-cuccinelli-white-house-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli is expected to take a top job at the Department of Homeland Security to help steer the administration's immigration policies, a senior administration official said.

Cuccinelli is not expected to take on the role of ""immigration czar,"" a position President Donald Trump had considered establishing to improve coordination between the agencies involved in handling the steep uptick in migrants crossing the US's southern border in recent months.

But Trump and White House officials hope Cuccinelli, a politically savvy immigration hardliner, will ensure the White House's immigration priorities are being carried out at the Department of Homeland Security.

There are few Senate-confirmed appointees in the top roles at the DHS, which some White House officials argue has slowed them down in advancing their policies.

Since he became acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan brought in several officials from Customs and Border Protection whom the White House did not view as immigration hardliners. Cuccinelli's appointment will help even that out, officials say.

China unlikely to sell off its US debt holdings: TD,https://www.afr.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/china-unlikely-to-sell-off-its-us-debt-holdings-td-20190522-p51pus,"Historically, the strategists said, China has sold Treasuries to check a sharp depreciation in the yuan as well as check capital outflows and that remains the most likely reason why China would be a seller again.

As for the potential that China would initiate a sell-off to retaliate against the US, the strategists are sceptical.

""We view retaliatory Treasury selling by China as the 'nuclear' response to trade tensions and view it as the least likely of those presented here.""

Another radical approach by China, in terms of selling Treasuries, could be to diversify its foreign exchange reserves out of US dollars into other currencies, the strategists said.

""This would be akin to the move taken by Russia in response to US sanctions, with Russian Treasury holdings declining from $US96 billion in March 2018 to just $US15 billion in May 2018.""

""However, China's $US1.1 trillion portfolio and trade surplus with the US make this degree of selling much less likely,"" the strategists said.

Still, China has been a heavy seller in the past, and it has had a market impact.

""From January 2015 to December 2016, we estimate that China (plus Belgium) sold $US430 billion of Treasuries. Note that these figures also include selling by Belgium because we believe China may have sold Treasuries through this custodian to disguise the magnitude of their selling flows.

""The selling was triggered by a change in PBOC's exchange rate regime, which then further exacerbated capital outflows and led to additional Treasury selling as the currency weakened.

""China was forced to sell Treasuries and buy RMB [yuan] in order to stabilise the currency, but not before creating significant market dislocations.""

Among the reasons TD sees as offsetting the need to sell in volume are there are fewer capital outflows now than in 2015, selling would lower the value of the nation's remaining Treasuries, selling of US dollar assets would boost the yuan, selling could tighten financial conditions, and there are few substantial alternative investments.

Still, TD isn't ruling out some selling.

""The situation remains fluid and if capital inflows do pick up, it is possible that China will be forced to intervene and sell some Treasuries.

""We will keep an eye for the following signs that China may be selling: an acceleration of capital outflows, an increase in dealer inventories of off-the-runs, or a cheapening of off-the-run to on-the-run Treasuries."""
This legislation could help more small tech companies land defense contracts,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/sbir-dod-legislation-mac-thornberry/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

Newly proposed legislation could increase the amount of work the Department of Defense does with small businesses — particularly those that get a majority of their funding from venture capital.

The Accelerating Defense Innovation Act would create a pilot project within the DOD’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to direct grant money to companies the department has otherwise avoided because of legal hurdles that stretch back more than a decade.

Created in 1983, SBIR provides small businesses with research grants to expedite their products’ development, as well as potential follow-on funding and assistance in meeting competitive requirements during the acquisition process. In 2003, courts ruled companies with more than 50 percent venture capital ownership are ineligible for SBIR grants. Congress created a waiver in 2011 for small businesses that are majority owned by multiple domestic venture investors, which requires congressional notification and Small Business Administration approval.

DOD has never used the waiver. Instead, the department “is turning away innovative small businesses with the most promising military and commercial technologies,” reads a fact sheet from the office of Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the new bill’s sponsor. For example, Thornberry’s office cites satellite technology from startup Capella Space that can see through clouds. The 50-person team came out of DOD’s Hacking 4 Defense program but failed to receive an SBIR grant because of venture capital investment.

The Domestic Investment Pilot Program would allow the secretary of Defense and service acquisition executives for each military department to make an SBIR award to a small business that is majority-owned by multiple domestic venture investors. The bill allows no more than 15 percent of DOD SBIR program funds to be awarded to small businesses owned in majority part by multiple domestic venture investors, and the program will end on Sept. 30, 2022.

Despite the limitations of SBIR, there are other ways for young tech companies to work with the DOD, regardless of their funding. The Defense Innovation Unit, for example, currently handles pilot projects for commercial innovations that any of the department’s branches may procure after testing is complete. The goal is to speed up time to agreement, which the unit generally reaches within 90 days of first contact with the company.

Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, wants to include his legislation in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the release said."
Five missteps that led to the removal of St. Petersburg Housing Authority board members,https://www.tampabay.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/05/21/five-missteps-that-led-to-the-removal-of-st-petersburg-housing-authority-board-members/,"City Hall veterans can’t remember officials ever removing a St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member from office. Now Mayor Rick Kriseman has replaced five of the seven-member voluntary board in just the past three months including three who were removed from office Thursday. Here’s a look at the missteps that have dogged the agency over the past year:

1. Relocation of residents from Jordan Park

The bungalows of Jordan Park sit empty behind a gate put up to enclose the properties.

The Housing Authority’s plan to demolish rather than renovate the last original structures of the historic African-American community was controversial enough. Then it relocated about 31 families from the complex even though there was no financing in place to redevelop it. Displaced residents complained they had been moved into deplorable housing, leading prominent community leaders including School Board Chairwoman Renee Flowers and City Council member Lisa Wheeler-Bowman to call for new board members that would challenge agency CEO Tony Love.





2. Charging its own board member for public records

St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member Terri Lipsey Scott received an email from the agency she oversees stating she must pay up to $400 for records she wants to review. The agency said her list of 14 different requests would take considerable staff time to produce. Other Tampa Bay housing authorities say they provide board members any records free of charge. CHRIS URSO | Times

Housing Authority board members, who are charged with overseeing the agency, serve on a voluntary basis. So Terri Lipsey Scott was outraged when she was told in January she would have to pay as much as $400 for agency records including minutes of meetings, staff evaluations of Love, and travel and legal invoices. By the time St. Petersburg City Council Chairman Charlie Gerdes decided he would intervene and pay for the records, the cost had risen to $900. The agency eventually returned Gerdes’ check and provided Scott the records for free.





3. Allowing CEO Tony Love to live for nine months in low-income housing

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love lived in a second-floor unit at Saratoga Apartments for nine months in 2016. The agency was originally required to pay his rent for six months as part of his relocation package. It also paid for $3,000 in furniture and his monthly electric bills.

When it hired Love in 2016, the Housing Authority agreed to pay his rent for six months as part of a relocation package. Love, instead, decided it made more sense for him to live in a vacant agency apartment than for the Housing Authority to pay for a privately owned one. He moved into a complex restricted to low-income families. Love, who at the time was earning $140,000, also billed the agency $3,000 to furnish the apartment and $625 for his electric bills, items that were not listed in his relocation benefits. The perk didn’t end after six months. Board members retroactively agreed to extend his stay for an extra three months. A Tampa Bay Times report exposing the misuse of agency resources led to the agency being cited by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in March.





4. Failing to disclose complaints about the CEO to board members voting on his $10,000 pay raise

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love was awarded a $10,000 raise in 2017. Some board members said they were never shown his evaluation but voted for the raise nonetheless.

Love’s first evaluation as agency CEO was conducted in 2017 by the agency’s personnel committee, which included board members Harry Harvey and Delphinia Davis. It included questionnaires filled in by about eight senior agency staffers about their boss. At least two of employees described a leader who bullied and belittled his workers and ordered some to work on preparations for his fraternity’s golf event. The complaints were serious enough for the agency to pay $3,600 for a consultant to work with Love on his people skills. But none of those reports nor the consultant’s report were forwarded to other board members who were asked later that year to approve raising Love’s yearly salary to $150,000. Board members approved the hike even though some questioned how they could vote on an evaluation they hadn’t seen.





5. Board members held emergency meeting in violation of Florida’s “Government in the Sunshine” act

With Kriseman’s pledge to remove three board members hanging over them, Board Chairman Harvey scheduled an emergency meeting April 10 for the board to authorize taking legal action against the city. Ironically, the meeting ended up making its way into the “charges” the city used to justify removing Harvey and Ann Sherman White from office.

The only public notice of the meeting was made to board members via an email sent by Love at 7:14 p.m. the night before it took place. State law says “reasonable notice” must be made to the public before such meetings are held, and that they must be open to the public. The meeting was attended by only three board members, too few to establish a quorum required by state law for board action. Nonetheless, the board voted to authorize suing the city. Concern about the legality of the action led agency attorney Charley Harris to recommend the board redo the vote at its next regular board meeting."
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."
Deadline ends for Alabama to meet DOJ demands on prisons,https://www.al.com,"['Mike Cason', 'Mcason Al.Com']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/doj-notification-period-on-alabama-prisons-coming-to-end.html,"It’s been seven weeks since the U.S. Department of Justice notified Gov. Kay Ivey of allegations that conditions in Alabama’s men’s prisons violate the Constitution because of the level of violence, sexual abuse and other problems.

The notification said the DOJ could file a lawsuit at the end of a 49-day period if the state’s response to the allegations is inadequate.

The 49-day notification is required under the federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, CRIPA.

Jay Town, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, issued a statement today in response to a question about the notification period ending. The three U.S. attorneys in Alabama were involved in the two-year investigation of prisons that led to the allegations and Town is working with state officials on the response and remedies.

“We are encouraged with the current progress of our negotiations with the State,” Town said in the statement. ""It is too early in this process, however, to determine whether there will be a need for CRIPA litigation. The Department remains hopeful that such a step will be unnecessary.”

Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who has been involved in the state’s response, had said earlier today he was not expecting a lawsuit, at least not immediately.

“We’ve had some very good conversations with DOJ and they know that we’re committed to working our way through this and trying to comply with some of their concerns,” Ward said. “I do not expect a lawsuit, at all. And they’ve been very reassuring on that. Now that’s not a guarantee.”

The DOJ could file a lawsuit later. The 49-day period was a minimum notification period before doing so.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers held a press conference last week about the prison issues.

They say the problems would be best addressed in a special session. Ivey has not said whether she will call a special session.

The governor issued a statement last week on the state’s longstanding problem with overcrowded, understaffed and dangerous prisons, saying, “This problem has been kicked down the road for the last time.”

“I am encouraged to know that the Legislature will continue to work on solutions during the remainder of this session, we will remain in constant communication with one another during the coming weeks and months to keep this issue on the front burner,"" Ivey said in the statement.

Legislators have nine meeting days left in the regular session, counting today. The session must end by June 17.

Bob Horton, spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, issued a statement about the notification period coming to an end.

“There is no 49-day deadline for enacting changes, nor is there a requirement that DOJ file a lawsuit,” Horton said. ""Since issuance of the findings letter, the State and the DOJ have engaged in collaborative communications seeking to jointly address the issues outlined in the DOJ’s findings letter.

“Even before the DOJ released its report, ADOC recognized the magnitude and scope of the challenges facing our Department. We have been working to identify and implement solutions to these issues and address long-established challenges that impact our prisons and inmate population. With Governor Ivey’s leadership and the partnership of our state legislature, we will continue to forge ahead to reform and reshape corrections in Alabama.”

Updated at 2:08 p.m. to add statement from the ADOC. Updated at 2:36 p.m. to add statement from U.S. Attorney Jay Town."
