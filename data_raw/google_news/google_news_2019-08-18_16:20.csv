Why Some Christians ‘Love the Meanest Parts’ of Trump,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Emma Green'],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/ben-howe-evangelical-christians-support-trump/596308/,"Howe’s book mirrors the frenzied intellectual mode of the Trump era. Over the course of some 200-plus pages, he spends a lot of time talking about Twitter and micro-events from the insane Trumpian news cycle. Very few “regular” people show up in his book—he relies on the work of reporters and the statements of a few prominent evangelical Trump supporters to make a broad case about rot in the American church. While Howe sometimes seems to write from within an echo chamber, his keyboard-warrior style also yields the most compelling sections of the book, in which he reflects on the toxic culture of right-wing media.

Read: On praying for the president

Conservatives who are so-called Never Trumpers are a rare breed to find in the wild, although you might not know it from the plush media gigs and small mountain of book deals this crowd has collected since Trump got elected. I wanted to talk with Howe because his rage is personal—it’s his church, his gospel, and his identity that he believes has been co-opted.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Emma Green: What bothers you so much about the wholesale evangelical support for Donald Trump?

Ben Howe: There is not necessarily anything inherently wrong with a transactional relationship with a president. But Trump brings a few problems. The first is the kind of support he demands, which is a loyalty even when he does something wrong. If you want to stay on his good side, you have to support what he did and even laud him for it.

The late ’70s, with Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority—the whole idea was that they were bringing something to Washington: expectations of morality and character. Now it seems like evangelicals are there to put faith around basic Republican politics.

Green: So it’s the hypocrisy that bothers you?

Howe: Hypocrisy irritates me, but it’s not the objective of the book to have people go, “Those guys are hypocrites.” People know they’re hypocrites. But I think people are misidentifying why they’re hypocrites, and that’s what I wanted to address.

Green: You grew up in this world, right?

Howe: Yes.

Green: Does that add to your irritation?

Howe: It is important for people to understand that I’m coming from within this movement. I’m not outside of it, looking in. I know what I’m talking about because this has been my life.

Green: You talk a lot about the bitterness that motivates evangelicals in the realm of politics. Where does that come from?

Howe: It comes from a reasonably understandable place. If people feel that their motives are impugned, if they feel they’re not bad people but are being told they are—being told they’re racist or misogynist—it can foster a mentality of victimhood.

In the minds of a lot of conservatives, the left exists to impugn their motives, and the Republican Party regularly lied to them and said they would defend them and then didn’t. And that was the establishment. Trump became their hero, because he hated the establishment, and he beat up on the media, and he was fighting back against all these forces. The more he fights, the more they feel justified, like, He’s our hero because we needed someone to do this for us."
Trump says French wine may face ‘100 percent tariff’ in response to tax on US tech firms: report,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-french-wine-may-face-100-percent-tariff-in-response-to-tax-on-us-tech-firms,"How serious is President Trump about firing back at France over its new tax on U.S. technology? Maybe as much as 100 percent.

During his visit to New York’s Hamptons for a fundraiser Aug. 9, the president reportedly told attendees he was thinking about hitting France where it may hurt most – by slapping a 100 percent tariff on French wine.

The president’s remarks, which two sources relayed to Bloomberg, were a follow-up to a Twitter message in late July, in which Trump wrote the U.S. planned “a substantial reciprocal action” against France for its digital tax on American tech.

TRUMP VOWS RETALIATORY TARIFF ON FRANCE, SLAMS 'FOOLISH' TAX ON AMERICAN TECH GIANTS

That week, French President Emmanuel Macron approved what was called a digital services tax -- a 3 percent levy that targets global companies worth at least 750 million euros ($834 million) and 25 million euros in France. It will be retroactively applied from early 2019 and could generate up to 400 million euros per year for France.

Trump immediately denounced the French plan.

“If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA,” Trump’s tweet said.

This coming Monday the U.S. Trade Representative’s office is scheduled to hold a public hearing with American tech leaders about the potential impact of France’s tax, the Bloomberg report said. Depending on their comments, trade boss Robert Lighthizer could recommend that Trump impose tariffs on France in response.

In his July tweet, Trump concluded with the line, “I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine” – even though Trump has claimed over the years that he never drinks alcohol.

“It might be on wine, it might be on something else,” Trump then told reporters about his plan.

Because France is part of the European Union, it’s unclear how Trump could specifically target the country without ensnaring the entire bloc."
‘People don’t want to be stupid twice’: Foreign diplomats brace for Trump 2020 win,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/18/foreign-diplomats-donald-trump-2020-1459069,"President Donald Trump visits Britain in June on a State trip. Many foreign diplomats, international officials and analysts predicted that Trump will win re-election in 2020. | Alastair Grant/AP Photo Foreign Policy ‘People don’t want to be stupid twice’: Foreign diplomats brace for Trump 2020 win The expectation that Trump will win could affect how allies and adversaries approach negotiations with the U.S.

Foreign diplomats are still feeling burned after assuming Donald Trump would lose in 2016 — and they don’t want to be fooled again.

So many of them are quietly predicting and preparing for a Trump victory in 2020. Some are even trying to game out who will be on the president’s team in a second term. The belief that Trump will win re-election — gleaned from conversations with around 20 foreign diplomats, international officials and analysts who deal with them — appears widespread.

Story Continued Below

“In 2016, nobody believed he was going to be elected. People don’t want to be stupid twice,” said Gerard Araud, the former French ambassador to the United States.

There’s no known scientific survey on the topic — few foreign officials would participate in one given diplomatic norms that preclude them from commenting on another country's internal politics. But none who talked to POLITICO were willing to say that Trump will lose. Instead, they pointed to three key advantages for Trump: He’s the incumbent, the U.S. economy is strong and the Democrats have no definitive front-runner to challenge him.

The expectation could affect how allies and adversaries approach negotiations with the U.S. While countries like China and Iran have shown signs of trying to wait out Trump, several foreign officials said it would be ill-advised to count on a Trump defeat in 2020. Even if Trump loses, they argued, some of his policies and views may shape U.S. foreign policy for years to come.

“The way it looks to people is it’s going to be another four years,” said an Arab diplomat, who, like most people, requested anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive subject. “If he gets reelected, he’s bound by nothing, except Congress. And I don’t know how that’s going to play out.”

Embassies are already planning — as best they can — for the post-2020 world.

An Asian ambassador said that every embassy in Washington is working “on the basis that the president has more than an even chance at being reelected.” But he, like others, said the embassies had to prepare for either possibility.

The ambassador said some countries may choose not to launch new initiatives with the United States now because “the possibility of it coming to fruition aren’t high,” especially once campaign season kicks into high gear. “But if there’s something already in the process, you’re probably not going to stop,” he said.

Another foreign diplomat’s embassy is already trying to predict who will be on Trump’s team in a second term. The embassy also is trying to figure out who will be in each Democrat's orbit, but with more than 20 candidates to follow, it’s hard, the diplomat said.

The diplomat noted that, on the one hand, Trump may lose interest in any sort of major policy moves in 2020 as the campaign heats up and takes up more of his time. Still, presidents often use foreign policy to make a mark when it’s clear that they can’t get any legislation through Congress in an election year.

“But Trump is very hard to predict!” the foreign diplomat said. “We are always very surprised.”

On some subjects, it may not matter much whether the Republican president wins or loses, several diplomats said.

On U.S. military involvement overseas, for instance, some Democratic candidates for president are showing isolationist impulses like Trump. And Trump’s desire for more “fair” trade deals isn’t too different from the views of challengers like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

In other words, no foreign government should bank on getting a better shake post-Trump.

“He’s not an isolated phenomenon,” a European diplomat said. “In his campaign and his presidency, he’s just responding to what the American public feels. The frustration he expresses, the grievances he responded to in his campaign are very often real.”

That hasn’t stopped a few countries from sending signals that they’d rather wait and see what happens.

China, for one, appears unlikely to strike a trade deal with the U.S. until after the 2020 election. Beijing has been increasingly reluctant to make concessions as Trump has slapped a steady stream of tariffs on the country’s exports.

Iran’s Islamist regime, meanwhile, appears unwilling to hold new nuclear negotiations with Trump, despite the president’s repeated imposition of sanctions that have battered the country's economy.

Yet other governments believe they could benefit from a Trump reelection.

Hungary and Poland have good ties with Trump, who critics say has been willing to look past anti-democratic developments in both countries. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly flaunted his relationship with Trump, whose favors have included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The U.S. president has also showered praise and arms sales on Saudi Arabia, despite bipartisan outcry over the country’s killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

“The current administration is really good from the business perspective,” one European ambassador said. “For governments who want regulations changed, they might have a better chance now than with another administration.”

The British are keen on inking a bilateral trade deal with the United States as soon as they leave the European Union. And the Trump administration has promised to work with them on one. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged the U.S. will be on Britain’s “doorstep, pen in hand.”

At the same time, though, Trump’s aides have signaled they will set out tough terms for any trade deal with London.

Then there’s Russia, whom U.S. intelligence agencies say interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. Trump has tried to be friendly to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but he also has imposed a bevy of sanctions on Moscow, so his presidency has been a bit of a toss-up for Putin.

North Korea is another interesting case.

Trump made history by meeting face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, part of an effort to strike a nuclear deal with the country. But neither side has made significant strides toward its ultimate goal — an end to North Korea’s nuclear program for the U.S., and an end to U.S. sanctions for North Korea.

Still, Trump touts his friendship with Kim, whom he says has sent him many “beautiful” letters, and has downplayed Kim’s recent short-range missile tests. Trump has also scaled back U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises, a gift to Kim.

The North Korean ruler may not get such generous treatment from a Democratic president eager to distinguish himself or herself from Trump.

Tom Wright, a foreign policy analyst with the Brookings Institution, pointed out that, aside from psychological preparation, most foreign governments have not made concrete moves to redefine their relationship with the U.S., a sign that they know anything can happen in 2020.

But if Trump does win, other countries may determine that something fundamental has shifted in the United States. For U.S. allies, such as France and Germany, that could mean a serious re-evaluation of their military and economic partnerships with Washington. These countries will likely expect that, it Trump wins, “future Democratic candidates will be more nationalistic,” Wright predicted.

“It’s not Trump, it’s much wider than him,” agreed a senior European Union diplomat.

“It’s not anymore that we are the two allies fighting together against threats like terrorism,” the diplomat added. “The way they look at us now is mainly as a market to conquer against Chinese interests. It has become a bilateral struggle between them and the Chinese for who conquers Europe or Africa.”

In 2016, many foreign officials fell for the conventional wisdom that Democrat Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump. This time, they admit there’s a bit of overcompensation as they tell their capitals to be prepared for a second Trump term.

And all admit that in a few months, they might feel differently, especially if the U.S. economy spirals downward as some fear it will.

Even then, several diplomats argued, Trump has a certain political talent — a knack for motivating his base while frustrating the Democrats. He’s a wild card that you can’t count out.

“What I’m saying right now is, I think, shared by many people,” a Middle Eastern diplomat said of the coming presidential election. “It’s his to lose.”

Kudlow says White House is ‘looking at’ trying to buy Greenland,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'Tory Newmyer', 'National Reporter Focused On Economic Policy', 'August At Am']",08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kudlow-says-white-house-is-looking-at-trying-to-buy-greenland/2019/08/18/ab367b6c-c1bb-11e9-b5e4-54aa56d5b7ce_story.html,"White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday confirmed that the Trump administration is exploring trying to buy the country of Greenland, noting that the self-governing country is a “strategic place” that is rich in minerals.

“It’s developing. We’re looking at it,” Kudlow said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Denmark owns Greenland. Denmark is an ally. Greenland is a strategic place … I’m just saying the president, who knows a thing or two about buying real estate, wants to take a look.”

President Trump’s desire to buy Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, was first reported last week by the Wall Street Journal. Two people with direct knowledge of the directive told The Washington Post that Trump has mentioned the idea for weeks, and aides are waiting for more direction before they decide how seriously they should look into it.

Trump is scheduled to visit Denmark in two weeks. In the days since news of Trump’s interest in Greenland broke, the idea has been ridiculed by politicians in Denmark, and Greenland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that the island is not for sale.

“Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism,” the ministry said in a tweet. “We’re open for business, not for sale.”

While many in the United States have mocked the idea, one Democratic lawmaker on Sunday voiced openness to considering it. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that “changes are happening” in Greenland due to climate change, “and the people up there understand it and they’re trying to adjust to it.”

“We have a very strategic base up there, a military base, which we visited,” Manchin said, referring to his visit to Greenland earlier this year as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation. “And I understand the strategy for that in that part of the world and the Arctic opening up the way it is now.”

He called Trump’s idea “a very interesting proposal” and said the Armed Services Committee, on which Manchin sits, should be receiving a secure briefing about it in the near future if the plan actually “has any merit to it.”

Trump is not the first U.S. president to propose buying Greenland. Kudlow noted Sunday that after World War II, President Harry Truman’s administration offered to purchase the country from Denmark for $100 million. The U.S. military had a presence in Greenland during the war as a means to protect the continent if Germany tried to attack.

With melting ice making the region more accessible, the United States has been firm in trying to counter any moves by Russia and China in the Arctic. China declared itself a “near-Arctic nation” last year and has defended its desire for a “Polar Silk Road” in which Chinese goods would be delivered by sea from Asia to Europe.

China recently sought to bankroll the construction of three airports in Greenland, drawing concern from then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and prompting the Pentagon to make the case to Denmark that it should fund the facilities itself rather than rely on Beijing.

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

Justice Department Sides With Led Zeppelin in ‘Stairway to Heaven’ Legal Battle,https://www.rollingstone.com,"['Daniel Kreps', ""Daniel Kreps'S Most Recent Stories"", 'Aretha Franklin Estate Backs Fund To Research Rare Form Of Pancreatic Cancer', 'Raconteurs Attend Baseball Game', 'Perform Concert', 'Then Return To Game', 'Justice Department Sides With Led Zeppelin In', 'Stairway To Heaven', 'Legal Battle', 'View All']",08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/justice-department-led-zeppelin-stairway-to-heaven-873059/,"The Trump administration weighed in on the legal battle over “Stairway to Heaven” this week, with the Department of Justice siding with Led Zeppelin in their copyright dispute with the estate of late Spirit guitarist Randy (California) Wolfe.

Although an appeal of the lawsuit against Led Zeppelin is still ongoing, the Justice Department filed an amicus this week in support of previous judge’s ruling that stated that the copyrights of musical compositions prior to 1972 were only protected as sheet music; in 1972, Congress changed the law to protect sound recordings, NBC News reports.

“Taurus,” the Spirit song that Led Zeppelin allegedly infringed on for “Stairway to Heaven,” was written in 1967, making it applicable to the previous federal law.

The Justice Department added that despite the similarities between the two tracks, under the previous federal law, the contested passages must be nearly identical; since they are not, the Justice Department argued Led Zeppelin rightly prevailed in the previous trial under the pre-1972 copyright law.

“There should be no serious dispute that the passages of Stairway to Heaven and Taurus that are at issue here are not virtually identical. At a minimum, the notes and rhythm are not all, or even mostly, the same,” the government wrote in the amicus.

Despite the Department of Justice’s stance, in response to an appeal by the Wolfe estate, the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals still ordered a new trial Friday, continuing the five-year legal battle. The appeals court found that the previous judge erred during jury instructions as well as refusing to allow the Wolfe estate’s legal team to play “Taurus” during Jimmy Plant’s testimony, Variety reports.

“Without a selection and arrangement instruction, the jury instructions severely undermined [the Wolfe trustee’s] argument for extrinsic similarity, which is exactly what the jury found lacking,” Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez wrote in his appeals decision Friday. The case will go before an appeals court in September."
"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days

Lawmakers demand VA fix emergency claims after report shows vets wrongly paid $53 million,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/457792-lawmakers-demand-va-fix-emergency-claims-after-report-shows-vets-wrongly-paid,"Lawmakers are demanding answers in the wake of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) watchdog report report that found $53 million in veterans' medical claims were wrongly denied over just a six-month period.

The bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers wrote VA Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieLawmakers demand VA fix emergency claims after report shows vets wrongly paid million VA to allow religious symbols at facilities Overnight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation MORE this week calling the VA inspector general's report ""damning"" and asking him to reconsider claims that should have been paid to veterans.

The inspector general report released last week showed that thousands of emergency care claims were denied between April 1 and Sept. 30 of 2017. An estimated 17,400 veterans were stuck paying medical bills totaling $53.3 million.

The watchdog report suggested one reason for the millions in rejected claims was due to the VA prioritizing speed over accuracy and offering incentives including overtime pay for claims processed quickly. The report found approximately 31 percent of denied or rejected claims were not properly processed.

“Facing a medical emergency can be stressful for any patient; however, the financial toll on veterans when VA erroneously denies or rejects payment can also be devastating,” the lawmakers' letter reads. “Nonpayment can bankrupt and destroy veterans’ credit histories. These administrative errors can remain with veterans for the rest of their lives.”

A spokesperson for the VA said in a statement that the agency ""appreciates the lawmakers’ concerns and will respond to them directly.""

""VA appreciates the inspector general’s oversight, which in this case highlights claims processed up to more than two years ago,"" the spokesperson continued.

""Prior to the report’s release, VA had self-identified the majority of the IG’s concerns, starting numerous efforts to fix them more than a year ago,"" the statement said.

""VA is reviewing the sample claims related to other health insurance highlighted in the report and will notify affected Veterans regarding their options for corrective payments and/or financial reporting revisions.""

The recent findings followed a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that detailed similar issues involving the VA.

In their letter this week, lawmakers questioned why past issues raised by the GAO had not been addressed.

“This is not new territory for the VA,” the lawmakers wrote. “More than five years ago, GAO found that VA’s weak oversight of emergency care claims adjudication could lead to inappropriate denial of claims. It is disappointing the department has not done enough to improve.”

"Opinion | With Trump as President, the World Is Spiraling Into Chaos",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/opinion/hong-kong-kashmir-trump.html,"Earlier this week, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, visited The New York Times editorial board, and I asked him about the threat of armed conflict between his country and India over Kashmir. India and Pakistan have already fought two wars over the Himalayan territory, which both countries claim, and which is mostly divided between them. India recently revoked the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of the part of Kashmir it controls and put nearly seven million people there under virtual house arrest. Pakistan’s prime minister compared India’s leaders to Nazis and warned that they’ll target Pakistan next. It seems like there’s potential for humanitarian and geopolitical horror.

Khan’s answer was not comforting. “We are two big countries with very large militaries with nuclear capability and a history of conflict,” he said. “So I would not like to burden your imagination on that one, but obviously if things get worse, then things get worse.”

All over the world, things are getting worse. China appears to be weighing a Tiananmen Square-like crackdown in Hong Kong. After I spoke to Khan, hostilities between India and Pakistan ratcheted up further; on Thursday, fighting across the border in Kashmir left three Pakistani soldiers dead. (Pakistan also claimed that five Indian soldiers were killed, but India denied it.) Turkey is threatening to invade Northeast Syria to go after America’s Kurdish allies there, and it’s not clear if an American agreement meant to prevent such an incursion will hold.

North Korea’s nuclear program and ballistic missile testing continue apace. The prospect of a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine is more remote than it’s been in decades. Tensions between America and Iran keep escalating. Relations between Japan and South Korea have broken down. A Pentagon report warns that ISIS is “re-surging” in Syria. The U.K. could see food shortages if the country’s Trumpish prime minister, Boris Johnson, follows through on his promise to crash out of the European Union without an agreement in place for the aftermath.

"State Department officials berated staff, labeled some 'traitors,' report says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/state-department-officials-watchdog-report-political-retaliation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top officials in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs subjected employees to ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" accusations of disloyalty, and retaliation, a long-awaited report from the department's watchdog agency found. The report also said the bureau's leadership ""did not take significant action"" to address these concerns.

""Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,"" according to the report released Thursday by the State Department Office of Inspector General.

The bureau's leaders labeled some employees ""traitors,"" if they felt they didn't support President Donald Trump. They berated others for following procedures, punished staff for not doing work the department's Office of the Legal Adviser had deemed ""inappropriate"" and targeted others for retaliation, in one case because of a staffer's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community.""

'Six to eight hostile interactions per day'

""Although some IO employees reported that they had never witnessed Assistant Secretary Moley or Ms. Stull behave unprofessionally, the majority of employees OIG interviewed either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others,"" the report said. ""In fact, one IO employee told OIG that working with Ms. Stull involved 'six to eight hostile interactions per day.'""

Stull left the department in January 2019 ; Moley remains in his post. Moley participated in an interview with the OIG, but Stull declined.

The report cited numerous examples of Stull and Moley berating employees for following established department procedures for tasks ranging from sending briefings to booking travel accommodations.

'Inappropriate accusations of disloyalty'

Stull and Moley also ""made inappropriate accusations of disloyalty and made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views,"" according to the report.

""For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' or 'disloyal,'"" the report said. ""Other career employees told OIG that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the 'Deep State' and that the Assistant Secretary accused them of 'undermining the President's agenda.'""

In one instance, the report noted, Stull ""expressed displeasure"" with a legislative affairs employee accompanying a delegation of the Congressional Black Caucus ""because it consisted of only Democratic members."" Stull accused the employee ""of trying to 'thwart' President Trump and undermine his agenda"" and many of the employee's job responsibilities were reassigned. That employee eventually left the State Department.

Retaliation

Moley and Stull retaliated against other employees as well, according to the report. Moley removed a principal deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, after she raised concerns about Stull's treatment of employees and conflict of interest.

Moley ""told the PDAS that he did not believe that her concerns about Ms. Stull were valid"" and ""it was obvious to him that she had problems working with Ms. Stull and that, therefore, the PDAS should be prepared to leave the bureau,"" according to the report.

In another instance, the OIG found that Moley had canceled the selection process for a deputy director position in order to support Stull's move to block the leading candidate for that post. Stull did not like the candidate's work with the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees -- a point which Moley confirmed to the OIG. Stull also reportedly had a problem with that candidate's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community,"" according to the report.

She criticized two career employees ""whom she believed had been insufficiently supportive of her position"" in a work dispute stemming from her time at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. She also attempted to remove work responsibilities from one of those employees for failing to assist her, despite the fact that what she had asked them to do was deemed ""inappropriate"" by the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Failure to address concerns

Despite concerns raised by both IO employees and State Department management, Moley did little to address them, according to the report. Moley told OIG ""that no employees had 'ever' raised concerns with him regarding morale or treatment of employees.""

However, the report said he had conversations with two undersecretaries in April and on June 13, 2018, and with Deputy Secretary John Sullivan on June 25, 2018 regarding the issues raised about his bureau. In each, he was advised to address the misbehavior.

In the June 13 meeting, he was directed to take several steps -- let all IO employees know about his commitment to inclusion, develop a staffing plan to address two IO departures, ensure that Stull had recused herself from all activities related to her prior work at the UN, and direct her to stop ""all further public engagement"" criticizing State Department employees.

Although Moley took some of these steps, the misconduct continued. The report noted that OIG continued to receive reports about ""hostile treatment of employees, allegations of disloyalty, and conflicts of interest"" throughout the course of its review.

'We won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended'

The watchdog recommended in its report that the State Department ""develop a corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" in IO within 60 days. It also noted the department should consider whether to take disciplinary action for the conduct described in the 34-page document. The State Department agreed with both of these recommendations, the report said.

Thursday's report presented the findings of one of two OIG investigations into political retaliation at the department. It was opened in June 2018 after members of Congress expressed concern to the State Department about allegations of Stull's vetting of career employees were reported by Foreign Policy Magazine.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel said Thursday that the report ""confirms what we feared: 'disrespectful and hostile' treatment of career employees at the State Department."" The New York Democrat urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fire Moley.

""There is more to come, and I hope it comes very soon. The delays from the Department on this matter have been frustrating. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is conducting an independent inquiry on these matters, and we won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences,"" Engel said in a statement."
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.20% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +1.44% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
Sean Hannity: Sources say 'most explosive' part of DOJ review is about 'outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-most-explosive-part-of-doj-review-about-outsourcing-of-illegal-intelligence-gathering,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said his sources are telling him the most ""explosive"" finding in the Justice Department review on the origins of the Russia investigation has to do with illegal intelligence-gathering on American citizens.

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Buying Greenland isn't a good idea — it's a great idea,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/buying-greenland-isnt-a-good-idea-its-a-great-idea,"The reaction to President Trump's sudden interest in buying Greenland from Denmark has been mostly one of derision. And Denmark, which owns the territory, appears to oppose any sale.

But don't laugh — an American purchase of Greenland could represent an extraordinary deal in terms of America's national security, economic interests, and environmental protection.

As much as it might seem out of the blue, U.S. acquisition of Greenland is not at all a strange or irrational idea. Following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany in 1940, American forces defended Greenland. The roots of American-Greenland comradeship are thus old and formal. In 1946, one Harry S. Truman even attempted to purchase Greenland for $100 million. Was Truman crazy? On the contrary, he was the president who ended a global war and set America on its ultimate course to defeat the Soviet Union.

As for the contemporary utility of purchasing Greenland, it has extraordinary strategic value. Through the U.S. Air Force base already present at Thule, Greenland offers critical intelligence capabilities to conduct satellite operations and to detect possible over-the-North-Pole nuclear missile launches from China or Russia. Thule better allows the U.S. to warn its citizens of an imminent attack.

And it does more than that. Thanks to Thule's deep water port and long runway, the base provides a logistics hub for operations in the Arctic. And it gives the U.S. military the means to deter and defeat prospective aggression. Russia, in particular, has been working to secure territorial control over resource-rich areas of the Arctic. America's presence in Greenland is increasingly relevant for that reason.

The purchase of Greenland would further strengthen these existing national security benefits. Unbound from political sensitivities in Denmark, for example, the U.S. could station missile forces in Greenland, including intermediate range missile forces. Russia's Arctic ambitions would have to be put on ice.

Greenland also abounds with resources. An already energy independent U.S. would have unfettered access to a land rich not only in hydrocarbons but also in rare earth metals that are currently only available from an adversary, China. Greenland also controls flourishing fishing waters.

But this isn't just about American interests. Greenland's small population also has everything to gain from a massive influx of American investment. The surge in tourism alone would surely offer a vast untapped potential.

And Greenland offers many grand opportunities for environmental protection. Its waters are home to numerous species of Whale, its lands to numerous species of flower and animals, and its skies to numerous species of birds. Greenland offers the potential for vast new designated wildlife reserves, and it would give American scientists the chance to study the Arctic environment from a unique vantage point.

As odd as it might sound at first blush — and America's purchase of Alaska also seemed very odd at the time — Americans of all political stripes would benefit from Greenland and its 56,000 inhabitants joining our national family."
E.P.A. Backtracks on Use of ‘Cyanide Bombs’ to Kill Wild Animals,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Vigdor'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/epa-cyanide-bombs.html,"The federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday withdrew its support for the continued use of so-called cyanide bombs to protect livestock from predators, reversing course amid strong opposition to the practice.

The E.P.A. administrator, Andrew R. Wheeler, said he was withdrawing an interim reauthorization for the use of M-44 devices, which are used to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals that prey on livestock. The agency, he added, would re-evaluate the highly criticized practice.

“This issue warrants further analysis and additional discussions by E.P.A. with the registrants of this predacide,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement on Thursday. “I look forward to continuing this dialogue to ensure U.S. livestock remain well protected from dangerous predators while simultaneously minimizing off-target impacts on both humans and nonpredatory animals.”

The federal Department of Agriculture, along with its state counterpart agencies in Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have relied on the M-44s for farming since the mid-1970s."
"New evidence shows why Steele, the Ohrs and TSA workers never should have become DOJ sources",https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/457628-new-evidence-shows-why-steele-the-ohrs-and-tsa-workers-never-should-have,"One of the inevitable outcomes of the Russia case will be that the Department of Justice (DOJ) almost certainly will need internal reforms.

The first reform is the most obvious, given the unraveling of the Russia collusion narrative: a new set of rules governing when the FBI can investigate or spy on a First Amendment-protected political campaign during an election.

The FBI never should have been allowed to sustain a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump Donald John TrumpPossible GOP challenger says Trump doesn't doesn't deserve reelection, but would vote for him over Democrat O'Rourke: Trump driving global, U.S. economy into recession Manchin: Trump has 'golden opportunity' on gun reforms MORE’s campaign based on hearsay from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who helped to arrange a $25 million Australian government donation to the Clinton Foundation, and on a “minimally” verified dossier written by British spy Christopher Steele, who was working on the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonLewandowski on potential NH Senate run: If I run, 'I'm going to win' Fighter pilot vs. astronaut match-up in Arizona could determine control of Senate Progressive Democrats' turnout plans simply don't add up MORE opposition-research team.

The second reform may be less visible but becomes painfully obvious, thanks to a series of internal DOJ investigative memos released this month that expose glaring issues with the handling, vetting and weighting of “confidential human sources.” That’s a fancy term for people — sometimes called “snitches” or informants, in street vernacular — who secretly provide evidence to law enforcement.

Some examples of the DOJ’s problems with informers fall outside the Russia case but mirror the same issues unmasked in the now-debunked probe of Trump.

Take, for example, the DOJ inspector general’s finding this month that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was paying other government officials at the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to work as informants.

The IG spared few words in decrying the idiocy of allowing government security officers collecting a federal salary to double-dip into taxpayers’ money by receiving informant pay to report criminal activity they were required by their jobs to disclose.

Two agents and one supervisor “violated the DEA Confidential Source policy” by paying three TSA workers as informants, the report concluded. And one agent wrongly served as handler for a TSA informant with whom he was involved in a “personal relationship,” investigators found, exposing a problem dating to 2013.

“By establishing the TSA employees as paid Limited Use Confidential Sources, the DEA agreed to pay for information that the TSA employees were already obligated to provide to law enforcement,” the IG concluded.

In other words, there should be a bright line: Government agents should stick to their jobs and leave the informing to private citizens.

That line similarly was breached in the minds of many when Bruce Ohr, then the DOJ’s assistant deputy attorney general, began collecting anti-Trump information on July 30, 2016, from former MI6 agent Steele and pushing it on the top levels of the DOJ and the FBI.

At the time, Ohr knew his wife, Nellie, and Steele worked for the Fusion GPS research firm on the same project to dig up Russia dirt on Trump, to help the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) win the 2016 election. Furthermore, Ohr told the FBI he knew Steele was a foreigner “desperate” to stop a Trump presidency, FBI memos show.

With his seniority inside DOJ, Ohr quickly got Steele’s information to the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and three top DOJ supervisors, despite the red flags.

Before long, Steele was working as a confidential informant for the bureau, and his dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant targeting the Trump campaign weeks before Election Day.

When Steele got fired Nov. 1, 2016, by the FBI for leaking to the media, Ohr became a conduit for the bureau to keep getting information from Steele for months. Ohr met at least 12 times in late 2016 and 2017 with FBI agents to provide new intel from the British spy. In other words, Ohr transitioned from being a DOJ supervisor to a backdoor source for the FBI to receive information from a terminated source.

And he didn’t stop there.

Records released this week, thanks to litigation by the conservative group Judicial Watch, show the senior DOJ official took at least two research files from his wife and her Fusion GPS work and provided them to FBI agents investigating Trump. One alleged that unverified ties existed between the Trump organization and Russian mobsters; the other provided a timeline alleging wrongdoing by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Nellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of her anti-Trump information came from foreign officials in Ukraine, including a parliamentary member highly critical of Manafort.

Examination of the Nellie Ohr documents given to the FBI shows some of her source material also came from former Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawsuit she filed against Manafort.

Why is that significant? Tymoshenko and Hillary Clinton had a simpatico relationship after the former secretary of State went out of her way in January 2013 to advocate for Tymoshenko’s release from prison on corruption charges.

So, Bruce Ohr became a conduit of information not only for intelligence from Clinton’s British opposition-researcher but also from his wife’s curation of evidence from a Clinton foreign ally and Manafort enemy inside Ukraine. Talk about foreign influence in a U.S. election!

ADVERTISEMENT

To Ohr’s credit, he disclosed his potential conflict of interest involving his wife to DOJ officials. To DOJ’s discredit, he was allowed to act as a source for both his wife and Steele anyway.

Ohr also didn’t get compensated as a paid informant, like the TSA workers. But documents show a curious thing happened during the time he began peddling the anti-Trump intelligence from his wife and Steele: His annual performance bonus doubled from about $14,000 in November 2015 to $28,000 in November 2016.

The blurred line between government official and informer/source didn’t stop with Ohr. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker also admitted he took dirt on Trump from DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann in summer 2016 and gave it to the agents investigating the Trump campaign.

The ultimate consequence — some might argue folly — of all these blurred lines is most easily exposed in an often overlooked document from the Russia probe.

I’ve written that the FBI kept a spreadsheet showing almost all of what Steele provided agents and Ohr on Russia-Trump dirt turned out to be unverified, disproven or nothing more than internet rumors. But when the FBI closed its paperwork on Steele in 2018, a professional intelligence analyst concluded in his human source validation report that the bureau assessed it had only “medium confidence” in Steele and that his intelligence could only be “minimally” verified.

In other words, his intelligence wasn’t very good. And yet, America spent nearly three years in turmoil only to learn that Steele’s Trump-Russia allegations — paid by Clinton and propagated by Ohr — were not true.

The tales of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele, Yulia Tymoshenko, and those DEA and TSA agents raise a stark warning: The lines between government officials and informants, unverified political dirt and real intelligence, personal interest and law enforcement, became too blurred for the Justice Department’s own good.

That’s a problem sorely in need of fixing.

"Trump’s plan to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ workers, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/16/20806990/trump-religion-lgbtq-discrimination-rule,"The Trump administration caused an uproar Wednesday for proposing a policy that would give certain federal contractors the right to discriminate against people who don’t share their employer’s religious views.

“Unconscionable,” “shameless,” and “dangerous” were just a few of the reactions from lawmakers and civil rights advocates over the religious-exemption rule that seemed, in particular, to target LGBTQ employees. Patricia Shiu, who oversaw the federal contracting office under President Barack Obama, described it to Vox as shocking.

The proposed rule from the Department of Labor dramatically transforms the government’s decades-old policy that bars federal contractors from discriminating against employees based on their race, sex, religion, disability, or national origin. It would instead weaken these protections by expanding the policy’s one exemption: the religious exemption.

Religious organizations — such as a Catholic legal aid group, for example — are already allowed to reject certain job candidates of different faiths. The new rule would go far, far beyond that, letting Catholic-affiliated businesses fire an LGBTQ employee because their views on same-sex marriage conflict with Catholic teachings. Or fire a pregnant woman who is unmarried.

The new rule would gut anti-discrimination protections in a “major and transformational way,” Shiu, who is now an advisor for the Berkeley Center on Comparative Equality & Anti-Discrimination Law, told Vox. “It’s so startling.”

While the rule seems to target LGBTQ individuals, as most religious exemption policies do, it’s so broad that it creates a loophole for employers to discriminate against anyone, Shiu said. She points out that big contractors could ask for a religious exemption so they don’t have to hire women, by saying that their religion dictates that women cannot work outside the home.

The Labor Department has played down this possibility, saying in its proposal that employers can’t use religion as an excuse to discriminate against protected groups. Right now, LGBTQ workers aren’t explicitly protected by federal anti-discrimination law, but even if they were, it would be awfully hard for an employee to prove that a company is using the exemption as a cover to discriminate.

The proposed change is, above all, a political move. By targeting the LGBTQ community, President Donald Trump is showing his support for the fundamentalist evangelical Christians who make up his base of support. These groups, which oppose same-sex marriage, have been fighting for years to weaken protections for LGBTQ Americans.

The new labor rule, explained

More than 42,000 US businesses hold federal contracts, and all of them agree to follow certain rules to keep their lucrative deals with the government. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, which prohibited contractors from discriminating against people on the basis of race — similar to protections Congress gave to individuals as part of the Civil Rights Act. At the time, many federal contractors would not hire black employees, so the goal was to make sure that taxpayer-funded contracts only go to businesses with integrated workforces.

Later on, the executive order would expand protections to employees based on other protected characteristics, such as a person’s sex, religion, national origin, or disability. In 2014, Obama’s labor department expanded it further to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The religious exemption was meant to be super narrow. Past administrations have interpreted it to apply only to nonprofit organizations, such as churches or social service groups, and these groups could only turn away employees who don’t belong to their faith.

Trump’s executive order interprets that exemption far more broadly to include a much larger group of employers, such as for-profit companies that have a religious affiliation (St. Jude’s Hospital, Goodwill, and Georgetown University, for example).

The new rule also explicitly creates a broader definition of the word “religion.” Instead of viewing religion as a particular organized religion, the government would now include “all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice as understood by the employer.” That language is very vague.

But here is the most concerning line in the 46-page document: The rule would “clarify that the religious exemption allows religious contractors not only to prefer in employment individuals who share their religion, but also to condition employment on acceptance of or adherence to religious tenets as understood by the employing contractor.”

In other words, not only could a religious hospital that contracts with the government refuse to hire someone who is Muslim or Jewish, they could also refuse to hire someone in a same-sex marriage or fire someone who had sex before marriage.

Conservative groups are pushing the limits of religious freedom

Some religious groups have been trying to weaken anti-discrimination laws at every level.

The US Pastors Council and Texas Values, two nonprofit evangelical groups, filed multiple lawsuits in county and federal court in October, claiming that Christian businesses and churches have a constitutional right to fire — or not hire — LGBTQ workers.

One lawsuit challenged the federal Civil Rights Act, which makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against job candidates and workers based on their religion, sex, gender, or race. Two other lawsuits sought to strike down part of an Austin, Texas, city ordinance that prohibits employers from discriminating against similar groups, and explicitly includes protections based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.”

In one of the lawsuits against the city of Austin, lawyers for Texas Values said the organization will not comply with the law. “Texas Values will not hire or retain practicing homosexuals or transgendered people as employees, because their lifestyles are contrary to the biblical, Judeo–Christian understandings of sexuality and gender that Texas Values seeks to promote,” they wrote in the complaint.

The federal lawsuit was dismissed in March; the county case is still pending.

The lawsuits marked a new front in the evangelical battle against the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Both right-wing Texas groups were also outspoken in the fight against the spread of so-called “bathroom bills,” which allow transgender individuals to use public restrooms designated for their identified gender.

Two Supreme Court cases foreshadowed this

In one of the Texas cases, the US Pastors Council argued Christian employers are allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ workers based on protections in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The federal law, enacted in 1993, sets a high standard for government legislators when writing laws that might burden a person’s right to exercise their religion. The act states that such a law must further a “compelling government interest” and must be tailored to minimize the burden on individual religious practices.

The law has generally been used to analyze other laws that might infringe on an individual’s religious freedom. But in a controversial 2014 ruling, the US Supreme Court extended the protection to Christian-owned corporations. In that case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts store chain challenged the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate, which required businesses to offer health insurance plans that covered the cost of birth control.

David Green, the evangelical owner of Hobby Lobby, objected to the mandate on the grounds that he was religiously opposed to paying for employees’ use of a form of contraception known as the “morning-after pill.” He considered this type of contraception similar to abortion.

The Supreme Court narrowly ruled in his favor, in a 5-4 decision. Justice Samuel Alito, in writing the majority opinion, said that the federal government had a compelling goal in crafting Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate: giving women free access to family planning services. But Alito argued that the government could achieve that goal without infringing on a business owner’s religious views. The government, for example, could pay for the contraception, or provide an exemption to businesses whose owners object to contraception on religious grounds.

The ruling was the first time the Supreme Court had extended the act’s individual religious freedom protection to a for-profit company.

That’s why the case raised so much alarm among LGBTQ advocates, who viewed it as potentially opening the door for businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender employees on the grounds that an employer is exercising religious beliefs.

However, in response to these concerns, Alito made clear that the court’s decision did not mean businesses could do such a thing. “This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to … provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice,” Alito wrote in the majority opinion.

That same view was reiterated in the court’s 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which a Colorado cake shop owner refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, based on the owner’s religious objection to same-sex marriage.

Though the court ruled in favor of the business owner, the majority said it did so because the Colorado government showed clear anti-religious bias when handling the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, made clear that religious beliefs do not justify discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.

Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.

The problem with these rulings and with the latest labor department rule is that it will be almost impossible for marginalized workers to prove illegal discrimination: Employers could simply justify their actions by pointing to their religious beliefs.

Shiu, who led the federal contracting office from 2009 to 2016, said the new rule is completely unnecessary. She said no federal contractors ever asked for a religious exemption to justify firing someone (or to refuse hiring someone) when she was the director.

“It’s a terrible solution in search of a problem,” she told Vox."
State Department watchdog details political retaliation against 'disloyal' staffers,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/state-department-inspector-general-report-political-retaliation-1464586,"Another report from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick on the broader topic of alleged political retaliation is expected to focus on staffers who worked directly for the secretary of state's office. | Alex Wong/Getty Images State Department State Department watchdog details political retaliation against 'disloyal' staffers

Top officials in the State Department bureau that deals with international institutions engaged in “disrespectful and hostile treatment” of staffers, including harassing some over suspicions that they were “disloyal” due to their suspected political views, a federal watchdog says.

At least one top career employee was forced out of her position for inappropriate reasons, while others found themselves stripped of their duties because of their superiors’ political biases, according to the watchdog.

Story Continued Below

The findings were contained in a report published Thursday by the State Department inspector general’s office. The report, obtained in advance by POLITICO, is the first of two from the inspector general that explores allegations that President Donald Trump’s political appointees retaliated against career State Department employees. The second report is still being drafted.

Thursday’s report singles out the assistant secretary of State for the department’s Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Kevin Moley, as failing to stop the misbehavior despite numerous complaints. It also contains a raft of examples of alleged inappropriate actions by Mari Stull, another senior political appointee in the bureau, who has since left.

Stull and Moley were said to have “frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff,” according to the report.

The majority of the employees the inspector general’s office interviewed “either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others. In fact, one IO employee told [the Office of the Inspector General] that working with Ms. Stull involved ‘six to eight hostile interactions per day.’”

The report has been eagerly anticipated by Democrats in Congress. On Thursday, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called its findings “offensive” and said that Moley should “resign or be fired.”

Engel added that he and his colleagues “won’t stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences.”

Moley did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but in a response to the investigation, which the inspector general included in his report, he said the misbehavior attributed to him “does not represent the person I am or have ever been.” He also insisted that many of the alleged incidents had been mischaracterized.

Stull, who served as a senior adviser to Moley, could not immediately be reached for comment. She declined the inspector general’s interview request during the investigation. Because she was no longer a federal employee — she left the State Department in January — she was not required to cooperate.

Stull, who was known to describe herself as “the Vino Vixen” because of her past keeping of a wine blog, was also alleged in past media reports as having tried to keep lists of career government staffers she considered disloyal or loyal to the president.

The report did not appear to directly address that allegation, but it noted that many of the bureau’s staffers said Moley and Stull “made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views.”

For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the department, Ms. Stull referred to them or other career employees as “‘Obama holdovers,’ ‘traitors,’ or ‘disloyal.’”

Moley, however, insisted to the inspector general’s office that “the only occasion on which he heard Ms. Stull make such remarks was in reference to former political appointees whom she believed were converted to career employees.”

Career government staffers are sworn to serve in government in a nonpartisan fashion, no matter who or which party controls the White House. But many of Trump’s political appointees believe there exists a “deep state” among the career staffers that is determined to thwart the president’s agenda.

The Bureau of International Organization Affairs deals with institutions such as the United Nations. That description alone made it a target of scorn among some top Trump political appointees because of the Republican president’s general disdain for multilateral institutions.

In Stull’s case, it may not have been all about ideology. Investigators wrote that they found evidence that she tried to retaliate against two employees of the bureau who she determined had failed to help her deal with a legal issue in one of her past jobs.

Stull had previously worked at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, and had filed an administrative claim regarding her time there. While still at the FAO, she tried to enlist a staffer in the State Department bureau to help with her case. The employee, after talking to his manager, consulted with legal advisers, who told him it was best not to intervene.

The report describes how, after joining the bureau, Stull went out of her way to undermine and complain about that employee and his manager.

“Ms. Stull’s criticism of these employees and her attempts to remove job responsibilities from the employee whose assistance she sought appear likely to have been based on her belief that the individuals did not provide her with sufficient assistance in her private employment dispute,” the report states.

In at least one case, the report says, there’s strong evidence that Moley forced out a high-ranking staffer — a principal deputy assistant secretary with an excellent record and extensive experience — after she raised concerns to him about Stull’s behavior and morale issues in the bureau.

“The circumstances of Assistant Secretary Moley’s removal of the PDAS suggests that he undertook a personnel action based on non-merit factors, namely, her articulation of concerns about Ms. Stull’s conduct,” the report states.

In another case, Moley and Stull are accused of deciding not to fill a bureau role that dealt with human rights because they did not like the leading candidate for the role, possibly because of the person’s relationship with the LGBTQ community. The person’s past work dealing with the U.N. agency that deals with Palestinian refugees was also said to have bothered Stull, who felt the agency was anti-Semitic.

Stull and Moley didn’t appear to understand or be willing to follow established chains of command at the State Department. They would assign duties to staffers without going through supervisors, for instance, or get upset if they weren’t immediately copied on certain papers, even though staffers were following standard procedures on when to route papers to them.

“For example, in April 2018, Ms. Stull asked a mid-level employee, without going through the employee’s supervisors, for information about another nation’s contributions to the UN,” the report states. “Ms. Stull did not believe the data provided was accurate, called the work product ‘garbage,’ and threw it at another employee.”

In one case, Moley is said to have implied, in an email, that the reason he needed to offer clearance on a document was to make sure it reflected the Trump administration’s position.

In another case, multiple witnesses said Stull and Moley had berated a junior employee over a document-routing issue, making her cry. Moley told investigators that he’d never raised his voice at an employee, and that the only time he had heard Stull raise her voice was to him.

Employees alleged that Stull even criticized some of them for clearing certain documents before she’d joined the bureau. “Two employees told OIG that Ms. Stull’s inappropriate conduct had become so pervasive that employees were afraid to put their name on any clearance pages,” the report states.

Moley, meanwhile, “criticized employees when they told him that official travel that he planned in May 2018 did not qualify for first class accommodations under the department’s travel policies and accused them of ‘not fighting hard enough’ to meet his demands,” the report states.

Stull appeared especially fixated on the career staffers’ political views, even though such employees are supposed to serve in a nonpartisan fashion. Some staffers told investigators that “Stull made positive comments about some specific career employees because they reportedly made contributions to Republican candidates.”

Stull also berated an employee because she’d accompanied a delegation of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the United Nations. The bureau’s staffers routinely accompany such delegations regardless of its composition, the report notes. But Stull “expressed displeasure with her for accompanying the Congressional Black Caucus delegation because it consisted of only Democratic members.” She accused the employee of trying to “thwart” Trump’s agenda, the report says.

The staffer soon found herself stripped of many of her responsibilities; she eventually left the State Department.

Inspector General Steve Linick recommended that the department develop a “corrective action plan” to fix the leadership deficiencies in the bureau. He also recommended that the department consider other moves, including “disciplinary action” against Moley.

The State Department has agreed on both counts.

Linick has been investigating allegations that Trump appointees had targeted career staffers for political retaliation since spring 2018. His other cases include ones involving the alleged actions of aides to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. They include one case exposed by POLITICO in which a career staffer of Iranian descent was ousted from a top policy role.

Linick’s investigation grew to cover the international organizations bureau after a June 2018 report in Foreign Policy about Stull, whom career staffers accused of deeply hostile behavior, including compiling loyalty lists.

The report issued on Thursday is based on thousands of emails and other documents, as well as investigators’ interviews with more than 40 people, including Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is not listed as having been interviewed.

“Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,” the report states.

The report, in a footnote, says Stull sent the inspector general’s office a letter in August 2018 that raised concerns “regarding fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as allegations that she had herself experienced retaliation as a result of her efforts to address these concerns.”

Investigators have looked separately into Stull’s claims, but they noted that the probe that led to the soon-to-be-released report did not uncover information to corroborate her allegations.

Many staffers said that they approached Moley with concerns about sinking morale, but that he would minimize it, according to the report. Moley told investigators no employee had ever brought such concerns to him.

“When individuals raised concerns with Ms. Stull about her treatment of employees, she asserted that she was herself the victim of harassment and informed at least one employee that raising such concerns was pointless because the Trump administration ‘has my back,’” the report states.

The report details several attempts by the State Department’s top leaders to get Moley and Stull to adjust their behavior, but it appeared to have limited effect, according to the report.

“Approximately 50 of 300 domestic IO employees have departed IO since Assistant Secretary Moley took over its leadership, and nearly all of the former employees who OIG interviewed stated that poor leadership of the bureau contributed to their decision to depart,” the report states.

Exclusive: VA whistleblower-protection worker asks for protection,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/16/va-whistleblower-protection-worker-brandon-coleman-seeks-protection/1891494001/,"CLOSE VA whistleblower Brandon Coleman, hired by VA to do outreach to whistleblowers, has some issues with the office established to protect them. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – All Brandon Coleman wanted was a meeting.

The onetime addiction counselor and Veterans Affairs whistleblower known for exposing poor care of suicidal veterans at the Phoenix VA hospital has been doing outreach to other VA whistleblowers since 2017 on behalf of President Donald Trump’s whistleblower-protection office.

This year, the office got a new leader, VA Assistant Secretary Tamara Bonzanto, so Coleman asked her for a few minutes to brief her on his efforts, including a new mentorship program for other whistleblowers.

""'Absolutely, Brandon, we can work that in,'"" Coleman recalled her telling him during an encounter in March. But the next day, he said a supervisor told him his program was being “put on hold” and he hasn’t heard from Bonzanto since.

Coleman told USA TODAY he has learned from colleagues in recent weeks that he has been excluded from meetings, his program is being eliminated, and he and dozens of other employees at the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection are being asked to submit resumes and worry they could face possible demotion or worse.

Coleman – one of the highest-profile employees of the whistleblower office – has now requested protection from another federal agency that protects whistleblowers, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In his request, which he also sent to members of Congress, Coleman described the work environment as ""toxic"" and said the office has turned into a ""Dumpster fire,"" according to a copy of his complaint sent July 31.

In interviews and written complaints reviewed by USA TODAY, three other employees who requested anonymity described Bonzanto as a leader who has cut herself off from employees and issued blanket orders without listening to front-line staff.

""We need help,"" Coleman said. ""How can you treat your employees the exact way we’re trying to protect employees from being treated?""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, the VA said Coleman's use of the terms ""toxic"" and ""Dumpster fire"" shows a ""critical disregard"" for the fact that problems at the office have been ""over two years in the making""and include a ""substantial backlog of cases.""

The agency said in a statement that Bonzanto is reorganizing the office to enhance communications with VA employees who report wrongdoing across the country and speed up investigations of the complaints.

The VA said leaders who conducted meetings to inform staff about the ""proposed realignment"" reassured them they ""will not lose their job or have their pay reduced.""

""OAWP has remained transparent with staff throughout the realignment process; solicited and received feedback; and responded to staff questions during multiple meetings and discussions,"" the VA said.

Hearing: Head of VA whistleblower office reassures lawmakers improvements are underway

The complaints from Coleman and his colleagues are the first to become public from inside the office. VA whistleblowers and advocates outside the agency have complained its operations have been ineffective and even vindictive.

VA whistleblowers drive push for change

Trump signed an executive order and later a law in 2017 creating the office to look into claims made by whistleblowers, protect them from retaliation and hold their managers accountable. Coleman stood behind Trump during the signing of the executive order.

Whistleblowing employees who have gone public to expose failures at the VA in recent years have played a critical role in driving a push for improvements at the agency. Health care workers revealed in 2014 that employees were keeping secret wait lists for appointments at the Phoenix VA and veterans had died while waiting.

Since then, they have come forward about the over-prescription of opioids to veterans in Wisconsin, equipment shortages in Washington, and dangerous conditions jeopardizing veteran care in Memphis, among other revelations.

In response to inquiries about Coleman's recent complaints, the VA said Bonzanto didn’t hear from him after he asked for the meeting in March, and his customer service duties ""will continue even after the office is realigned.""

After USA TODAY reached out to the VA for comment about Coleman's request for a meeting with Bonzanto, a senior official told his lawyer he could schedule an appointment.

""If employees have concerns, we encourage them to discuss them with OAWP leadership or provide specific examples so that we can address their concerns directly,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Unfortunately that didn't happen in this case.""

The whistleblower office has been under investigation by the VA inspector general for months and a report is expected in September. A Government Accountability Office report last year raised concerns about the independence of the office’s investigations of wrongdoing reported by whistleblowers.

The VA said Bonzanto’s reorganization is a key improvement she’s making to help address those concerns.

""The inspector general and congressional stakeholders have expressed the need for improvements at OAWP, and that’s precisely what VA Assistant Secretary for Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Dr. Tamara Bonzanto has been focusing on,"" the agency said.

Personal crusade

Improving the VA has been a personal crusade for Coleman, a former Marine with six children, including three Marines. For years, he has backed giving veterans more options for outside care paid for by the VA – a proposal Trump ultimately signed into law.

After Coleman reported in 2014 that suicidal veterans were neglected and left to walk out of the Phoenix VA, his bosses at the time accused him of misconduct and shut down his addiction-treatment program. It took nearly two years to settle the case and get Coleman's program reinstated. He went on to testify before Congress about his experiences.

Coleman was hired to do outreach for the whistleblower office and provide insights to managers on policies and programs.

The office quickly began taking in reports from VA employees – more than 1,000 in the first six months, including more than 200 alleging retaliation by VA bosses for speaking out about problems and dozens about potential threats to veteran health and safety. The office staffed up with more than 50 employees to triage and investigate the reports.

Coleman created the mentorship program, which paired a whistleblower with a senior leader to create and implement an improvement project at their VA hospital. The first pairing Coleman oversaw was in Shreveport, Louisiana, where social worker Shea Wilkes faced retaliation in 2014 after he revealed schedulers had been manipulating appointment wait times.

He partnered with Shreveport VA Director Richard Crockett last year to work on a hotline for employees to anonymously report problems. The VA hailed Coleman’s success in Shreveport last October and said it would ""serve as a model nationwide.""

But complaints about the office’s investigative division had been mounting, including allegations in the GAO report last July that the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing to participate in investigations of the accusations.

We look forward to sharing updates about the great work we’ll be doing for #Veterans under her leadership. pic.twitter.com/PWmJOBZx4u — OAWP (@VAOAWP) January 7, 2019

Bonzanto, who was previously an investigator with the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was brought in as a change agent in January.

Meanwhile, Coleman continued to vet new whistleblower applicants for his mentorship program – they had to submit resumes and do interviews to be considered. He said he had eight lined up when he approached Bonzanto to ask for the meeting in March.

Exclusive: Inside Trump's new VA office, early moves to help whistleblowers draw praise

After the program was put on hold, Coleman has continued to triage incoming calls from whistleblowers. When he was excluded from the reorganization meetings last month, he said he started receiving calls from colleagues reluctant to report problems because of fear of retaliation from their bosses.

That’s when, Coleman said, ""It hit me.""

""I no longer feel confident referring whistleblowers to come to OAWP for help,"" he said. ""Something’s wrong with the office, and that’s why it was time to come forward. This needs to be fixed.""

DOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda,https://thehill.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/457772-doj-should-take-action-against-chinas-twitter-propaganda,"Over the last few years, Chinese state media organs have accelerated a campaign to leverage U.S. social media platforms – namely, Twitter – to promote the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) narrative on several issues. All of China’s major state media outlets have Twitter accounts, through which they regularly disseminate a variety of material.Hu Xijin, who heads the state-run Global Times, has become the government’s de facto English-language commentator on trade tensions with the United States.

Beyond this, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai launched an account to share the party line on the recent Hong Kong protests and the Taiwan independence movement. Chinese state media outlets have even targeted a U.S. diplomat for meeting with Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, exposing her personal information and drawing a stern rebuke from the U.S. State Department.

The irony of this trend is not lost on anyone with some familiarity of China’s censorship regime. That China’s state-sponsored propaganda can freely subsist in the virtual echo chambers of Twitter while the platform is blocked entirely on the Chinese mainland is certainly a less than reciprocal arrangement. But beyond this, the circulation of propaganda by certain Chinese state media outlets throughout the United States via Twitter in its current form appears to be in violation of U.S. law.

Last fall, under the tenure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsDOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda Lewandowski says he's 'happy' to testify before House panel The Hill's Morning Report — Trump and the new Israel-'squad' controversy MORE, the Department of Justice (DOJ) directed Xinhua News Agency and CGTN to register as foreign agents per the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. Xinhua is China’s major state-run media outlet, while CGTN is China Central Television’s overseas operation (the English-language China Daily has also been registered since 1983). This was indeed a major step toward ensuring that these entities meet the comprehensive disclosure requirements for foreign lobbyists seeking to influence U.S. politics. A critical aspect of their activity that has gone unpunished, however, is their unbridled sharing of CCP narratives on Twitter.

Per the DOJ, Section 4 of FARA “outlines the responsibilities of a registrant who disseminates informational materials on behalf of a foreign principal.” Section 4(b) of the law effectively requires that such entities provide a disclaimer on any informational materials disseminated that includes “a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed by the agent on behalf of the foreign principal, and that additional information is on file with the Department of Justice.”

While it is unclear whether CGTN and China Daily (Xinhua has yet to register) have been regularly providing the DOJ with copies of each of their tweets (let’s just say it’s unlikely), their tweets currently do not include any obvious indication that they are being transmitted on behalf of the foreign principal, the Chinese government. More broadly, as a matter of policy, Twitter does not even distinguish between such foreign agents, their employees, and the rest of the Twitter user base. To date, the only means of distinguishing one’s account is the coveted “verified” status, which, according to Twitter, is granted to accounts “of public interest.”

Twitter providing foreign agents like CGTN and China Daily with the legitimacy that comes with the verified status without making clear that they are registered foreign agents is negligent, if not irresponsible, and warrants a review of this policy. But regardless, the frequent activity of these accounts on the platform – which most certainly falls under the umbrella of “informational materials for or in the interests of such foreign principal” – deserves the attention of the DOJ.

There is undoubtedly a lack of enforcement in this area, and the specifics of how the provision should be applied can be debated by the relevant authorities and Twitter personnel. Indeed, the attorney general has the statutory authority to “define what constitutes a conspicuous statement,” or disclaimer label. But the need for action is obvious. If our government considers Russian bot posts a threat to election security, and Twitter regularly takes action to combat such disinformation, then why are similar campaigns by Chinese state actors any less concerning?

Say what you will about China’s censorship regime and its ability to control narratives within its own borders. But Twitter is a U.S. company with more than 300 million active monthly users and, for better or worse, serves as the primary mouthpiece of the sitting U.S. president.

As a platform, it carries significant weight in U.S. politics. It thus bears significant responsibility, not only to help foster a secure election environment but also to prevent state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from gaining traction in U.S. political discourse through unfettered, noncompliant distribution of propaganda.

Given that the expressed purpose of FARA itself is to “protect the national defense, internal security, and foreign relations of the United States,” a first step toward this aim would be for the DOJ to require CGTN and China Daily, and eventually Xinhua (and by extension, other foreign agents like Sputnik and RT), to provide the required disclaimers on all media shared via Twitter and work with the company to hammer out the specifics of how this would be implemented.

We do not censor in the United States, and state-sponsored propaganda outlets should still be free to partake in the marketplace of ideas and enjoy the first amendment rights that often do not exist in their home country. But first and foremost, they must comply with existing U.S. law.

Lawmakers Accuse State Dept. of Defying Federal Law by Missing Deadlines for Yemen Reports,https://www.nytimes.com,['Catie Edmondson'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/state-department-yemen-reports.html,"WASHINGTON — In defiance of federal law, the State Department is refusing to submit reports to Congress detailing efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, according to legislators and congressional aides.

Trump administration officials have missed both congressionally mandated deadlines this year to submit the biannual reports, most recently last week. This has further inflamed tensions between the administration and legislators who were already furious with the administration’s unflagging support of the Saudi government and were still stung by the White House’s decision in May to circumvent Congress to sell arms to Riyadh.

“Congress has tried again and again to bring accountability and transparency to America’s role in the war in Yemen. At every turn, the Trump administration has blocked our efforts,” said Representative Eliot L.

Trump intervention triggered EPA’s surprise biofuel waiver decision: sources,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/16/trump-intervention-triggered-epas-surprise-biofuel-waiver-decision-sources/,"WASHINGTON — A phone call from US President Donald Trump last week ended a nearly two-month-long review of the nation’s biofuels program, three sources familiar with the matter said, with the White House siding in favor of oil refiners over corn growers.

Trump gave Andrew Wheeler, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the green light for the regulator to announce it had granted 31 small refinery exemptions out of the 40 applications, saying he wanted the issue off his desk, the sources said.

Trump’s call triggered a flurry of action within the EPA, leading up to a surprise Friday afternoon announcement, after weeks of negotiations between US government agencies failed to make progress in addressing farmers’ concerns.

“The president has heard from all sides and in the end he has had enough of it. He called Wheeler and gave him the green light,” a source familiar with knowledge of the matter said.

The White House has sought to make changes to the nation’s biofuels laws since the beginning of Trump’s administration in early 2017, but found themselves caught between the powerful oil and corn lobbies, both of whom have allies in Washington in Trump’s Republican Party.

The debate underscores the rising political importance of the US Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than a decade-old federal policy that requires refineries to blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline or buy credits from those that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refineries, including some operated by giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging farmers who claim the exemptions threaten demand for one of their staple products.

Refiners dismiss the argument, saying ethanol demand has not been affected.

The White House declined to comment for this story. The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump had ordered the revamp of the waiver program in June, after hearing from angry farmers during a trip to Iowa, the nation’s top ethanol producing state. Even though the corn lobby seemed to have the upper hand in early talks, the oil industry’s efforts eventually gained more traction, industry sources have told Reuters.

Iowa is a swing state that Trump carried in 2016 and is potentially crucial for his re-election efforts next year. Farmers in the state have also chafed under Trump’s trade war with China that has sapped demand for agriculture products.

Farmers slammed last Friday’s decision, saying the Trump administration was bailing out the oil industry at a time when U.S. farmers were suffering due to his trade war with China. The refining industry welcomed the move, saying the waivers are lawful and help shield small refiners from the burdensome cost of compliance with RFS."
Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/457719-senate-dem-seeks-answers-from-dhs-on-reports-of-pregnant-asylum-seekers-sent-back-to,"Sen. Jeff Merkley Jeffrey (Jeff) Alan MerkleySenate Democrats push Trump to permanently shutter migrant detention facility Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico Schumer backs Pelosi as impeachment roils caucus MORE (D-Ore.) on Friday asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to clarify reports that pregnant asylum-seekers have been forced to wait out their immigration cases in Mexican border cities.

Merkley wrote DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, asking why six late-term pregnant women were included in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in May.

Under the program, known colloquially as “Remain in Mexico,” non-Mexican migrants seeking asylum in the United States are sent back across the border to await results of their asylum claims in U.S. immigration courts.

The Trump administration implemented the program in January with the acquiescence, but not outright support, of the Mexican government, which agreed to take in the migrants rather than deport them back to their countries of origin.

DHS in March expanded the program from the California border to El Paso, Texas, where the pregnant women were reportedly included in MPP.

DHS officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

“Policies and practices targeting pregnant women at the border are horrific and these allegations must be immediately investigated,” wrote Merkley.

Under U.S. law, children born in American territory would be natural-born U.S. citizens. If the children of third-country nationals are born in Mexico, they are also entitled to Mexican citizenship.

While Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican border city across from El Paso, has some infrastructure to provide medical services, migrant shelters in the city are reportedly overbooked and unable to care for guests with specialized needs.

Asylum-seekers with special medical needs are exempt from MPP, but that exemption does not explicitly include pregnancy.

""It is beyond question that pregnant women, particularly those nearing full term, have known health issues,"" Merkley wrote.

And Ciudad Juárez is among the most dangerous cities in Mexico, host to more than 170 murders per month.

“Forcing pregnant women to wait alone in Mexico for their asylum hearings puts them at extreme risk of abuse and extortion. Moreover, it creates significant health risks for mothers and children facing imminent delivery dates when proper medical care is not available,” Merkley said."

""I don't know nothing about that,"" Pentangeli says in response to a question about Corleone's connections to organized crime. ""Oh — I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.""

""I kept saying Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that, so I said, yeah, sure,"" Pentangeli says, downplaying his earlier comments, in which he accused Corleone of crimes.

Westmoreland housing authority ownership change expected to increase revenue,https://triblive.com,['Rich Cholodofsky'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/westmoreland-housing-authority-ownership-change-expected-to-increase-revenue/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Westmoreland County’s housing authority transferred ownership of nearly 10 percent of the agency’s public housing units as part of a reorganization officials said will enable it to increase the money it receives for needed capital improvements.

“This is a decision that makes all the sense in the world. We will get more money from this and it gives us the ability to secure capital funding to renovate those units,” said Housing Authority Executive Director Michael Washowich.

No money will directly change hands as part of the transfer. Housing authority officials said the transfer was essentially a paper transaction to reclassify the units into a different subsidized housing program.

The move stems from a policy change enacted last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that allows for the transfer of ownership of public housing units to subsidized housing programs that utilize federally-funded vouchers. The program shift will change the manner in which the authority receives funding for those units but is not expected to impact tenants who live in those units, Washowich said.

Federal funding for the voucher program has been more secure in recent years, meaning the authority expects to receive more money to operate those units, according to authority administrators.

“Tenants will see no shifts in rent. They won’t even know this happened,” Washowich said.

The authority operates about 1,800 public housing units. The eight properties impacted by the transfer are in Vandergrift, Arnold, Lower Burrell, Latrobe, Derry, Jeannette, Greensburg and Penn Township. Ownership of 174 housing units will be transferred to the Westmoreland Nonprofit Housing Corp., a subsidiary of the authority that currently operates about 350 housing units in eight housing communities throughout the county.

"FBI 'indifferent' to possible China hack of Hillary Clinton's server, as State Department fought to protect her, interviews suggest",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-indifferent-to-possible-china-hack-of-hillary-clintons-server-as-state-department-fought-to-protect-her-interviews-suggest,"Interviews with intelligence community officials have revealed that senior FBI leaders ""seemed indifferent to evidence of a possible intrusion by a foreign adversary"" into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s non-government email server, and that State Department officials allegedly sought to ""downgrade classified material found on the server,"" according to Senate investigators still probing the matter.

The information was contained in a letter and interview transcripts sent Monday by the majority staff on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees to senior Senate Republicans including Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter also noted that “neither the committees nor the FBI were able to confirm whether an intrusion into the server occurred.""

The review began after two August 2018 news articles ""alleged that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary Clinton’s nongovernment server and inserted code that forwarded nearly all of her emails to the foreign company,"" the letter stated, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and a later piece by Fox News.

'OMG' -- TOP CLINTON AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT ATTEMPT TO HACK SERVER IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News at the time that the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) was so concerned by the revelation that officials drove over to the FBI to inform agents -- including anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok -- of the development soon after it was discovered via the emails' metadata in late 2015 or early 2016.

The source said the hack was from a Chinese company, describing it as a front for Chinese intelligence.

The letter to Grassley continued: ""The reporting indicated that two Intelligence Community Inspector General [ICIG] officials – Frank Rucker and Jeanette McMillian – discovered the code and brought the possible intrusion to the attention of the FBI.""

In a December 2018 interview with Senate investigators concerning the reporting on the potential foreign hack, Rucker said Strzok -- then the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division in charge of the Clinton investigation -- seemed ""aloof and dismissive.""

And Strzok didn't ask many questions, according to Rucker.

McMillian, meanwhile, said FBI employees were ""poker-faced"" during the roughly hourlong meeting about the potential breach, even though both the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had ""significant equities"" in the information contained on the server.

STATE DEPT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY VIOLATIONS' AMID ONGOING REVIEW OF CLINTON EMAILS

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McMillian told investigators the episode began when Rucker identified an email address in Clinton's email metadata as a potential ""live dropbox"" for all her emails, which a foreign actor could access.

When Rucker then Googled the email address on the suggestion of then-ICIG Charles McCullough, the name of a Chinese company, ""Shandong Carter Heavy Industry Machinery,"" popped up -- leading Rucker and McCullough to suspect Chinese involvement, according to Rucker's interview with investigators.

In April, the ICIG and Justice Department IG determined that the address apparently matched the one that former Clinton technology aide Paul Combetta -- who managed her server and thoroughly deleted a slew of her emails -- had created as a ""dummy"" to create backups of Clinton's emails.

However, the DOJ IG and ICIG said they “did not identify any information obtained by the FBI during the [Clinton email] Midyear investigation reflecting that Combetta’s dummy email account was associated with a Chinese company or the Chinese government.""

Throughout, according to McMillian's remarks to Senate investigators, FBI brass generally seemed ""impressed"" with Rucker's technical abilities in finding the apparent breach, and apparently took the issue seriously. McMillian specifically said Strzok had found the email account's presence in Clinton's metadata ""strange.""

McMillian said she made sure to tell the FBI that the ICIG was not trying to usurp the FBI's authority after bureau officials asked how it had found information about the potential breach. The FBI made clear the ICIG would provide information to the bureau, but not the other way around, McMillian and Rucker said.

A May 2016 email from Strzok, obtained by Fox News last year, said “we know foreign actors obtained access” to some Clinton emails, including at least one “secret” message “via compromises of the private email accounts” of Clinton staffers.

Strzok, earlier this month, filed a lawsuit against the bureau and the Justice Department – arguing that the FBI caved to the “unrelenting pressure” of the president when it fired him.

DOJ IG Michael Horowitz previously concluded that although he could not prove Strzok had let his political bias influence official decisions during the Clinton email investigation, he did not have confidence that Strzok had acted without bias at critical junctures in the probe.

In text messages with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok said on his government-issued phone that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president, and called Trump supporters ""retarded.""

Separately, Rucker and McMillian offered more details into reports that the State Department sought to cover for Clinton by downgrading the classification of emails on the server.

FBI SCRAMBLED TO ANSWER TO CLINTON LAWYER IN DAYS BEFORE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NEW DOCS REVEAL

“At first, State fought back against the intelligence community being involved,"" McMillian told investigators, before noting that they eventually relented.

McMillian claimed that two State Department employees tried to shield some of Clinton's emails from disclosure under the ""deliberative process"" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act -- rather than labeling the emails classified.

The employees, Austin Evers and Catherine Duval, did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Evers has since launched the organization American Oversight along with other former Obama administration officials. The group says it is devoted to uncovering ethics issues in the Trump administration.

Rucker also claimed that then-Ambassador Patrick Kennedy questioned ""whether certain emails should be provided to the intelligence community for review and fighting against classifying other emails,"" according to the Senate investigators.

The State Department didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Interviews released in 2016, known as 302s, first revealed the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.

Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering.

“In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said at the time.

In a lengthy statement, the FBI denied it had agreed to declassify any emails in exchange for more overseas slots from the State Department.

A comprehensive IG report into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct during the Clinton and Russia probes is expected soon.

Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"
DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan: Border Crossings Down 43 Percent Since May,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Helen Raleigh', 'Jason Delisle', 'Preston Cooper', 'Andrew C.

(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May, when arrests between ports of entry at the southern border increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.

“So those efforts are making progress, 43 percent reduction in crossings since May,” McAleenan said. “We’re hoping to continue the progress in August.”

McAleenan said DHS is working with Central American countries to protect migrants who need asylum as well as conduct an “aggressive effort against human smugglers,” a project he said “could really change the game.”

“I’ll be going back to Central America next week to try to build on that with El Salvador and Panama and really address this problem as a regional effort,” he said.

The number of immigrants being held at border stations is also down significantly from its June high of 20,000, McAleenan said. “This morning we have less than 4,000, and they’re not staying with us very long. We’re able to repatriate the single adults quickly. The unaccompanied children are going to a better situation with Health and Human Services.”

The acting DHS chief went on to take a shot at what he sees as a toxic political environment “where we’re demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs,” calling it “concerning.”

There have been several attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in recent weeks, including incidents on Tuesday in which shots were fired into two San Antonio facilities. The FBI is investigating those attacks as an “assault on a federal official case.”

“It can be dangerous, and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts, that are not in response to anything inappropriate that our men and women of ICE and enforcement removal operations are doing,” McAleenan said. “And I think we’ve got to tone that down, absolutely.”"
The USDA Dropped a Corn Bombshell. What It Means for Deere and Other Stocks.,https://www.barrons.com,['Al Root'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-usda-dropped-a-corn-bombshell-what-it-means-for-deere-and-other-stocks-51565705634,"Text size

The U.S. Agriculture Department, or USDA, zigged on Monday when the market expected it to zag.

The farming agency released its monthly world grain report, called WASDE, and, surprisingly, the agency sees a bigger U.S. corn crop—despite poor weather in the Midwest. Corn prices cratered as a result.

Corn futures contact prices dropped “limit down” on Monday—dropping about 6%—meaning futures reached their maximum allowable daily losses on Chicago exchanges. And corn prices were down again Tuesday. What roiled commodity traders was the USDA increasing the expected corn yield per acre for farmers in the 2018/2019 crop year. (For farmers the “crop year” goes from harvest to harvest.) The USDA now expect farmers to produce about 169 bushels of corn per acre, up from expecting 166 in July. (Bad weather has had an impact though—U.S. corn yield was more than 176 bushels per acre last year.)

Read more: Corn Crop Problems Could Lead to Higher Prices

That’s good news if you are a user of corn, such as a food company, such as corn buyer Post (ticker: POST).

“We view the USDA’s August WASDE report as positive for packaged food manufacturers, as fears over a run-up in grain-driven input cost inflation are being alleviated by a robust corn supply outlook,” writes Citigroup analyst Cornell Burnette in a Tuesday research report. “Thus, our positive thesis for the sector remains intact.”

But higher corn production isn’t such good news if you sell inputs or equipment to farmers, such as Deere (DE).

“Deere’s near-term fundamentals were challenging exiting the second quarter 2019 but there was hope that investors could look through near-term weakness as higher corn prices would deliver demand reacceleration in 2020,” writes Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Monday evening research report. “The 2019 crop still has challenges that could drive prices higher, but the near term is decidedly more difficult after today’s USDA forecast updates.” Dobre rates shares of Deere Buy, but he cut his price target to $150 from $170 based on the USDA news.

Things could still change for the U.S. corn outlook. Weather, exports, ethanol demand all feed into the USDA models, and all inputs are fluid. Agricultural consultant Mark Feight of International Agribusiness Group, or IAG, believes the corn acreage figures could still come down when the USDA reports figures in October.

Stocks usually don’t overreact to a single crop report because equity prices reflect long-term business value—at least, that’s what the theory says. The long-term trend in agricultural prices and acreage matters more for stocks. Still, there were some big moves along the agricultural value chain on Monday.

Post , for instance, dropped 1.4% on Monday along with the 400-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That wasn’t a surprise, but ethanol producer Green Plains (GPRE) actually dropped 4.3%, even though corn is an input for the company. Ethanol demand also influences Green Plains stock. Input provider Corteva (CTVA) dropped 6%, and tractor maker Deere dropped 5% in Monday trading.

ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Horowitz reportedly “homed in” on Steele, and his team reportedly interviewed the ex-spy in June.

Meanwhile, Barr, along with U.S. Attorney John Durham, launched his own inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Trump gave him broad declassification authority to look into it."
Environmentalists renew bid to overturn EPA policy barring scientists from advisory panels,https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457631-environmentalists-renew-bid-to-overturn-epa-policy-keeping-scientists-off-advisory-committees,"Environmental groups on Thursday appealed a court decision in their attempt to end the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) policy of excluding certain scientists from serving on its advisory boards.

“The Trump administration is simply trying to payback its polluter cronies by gutting sound science that our health and environmental protections rely on,” Neil Gormley, an attorney with Earthjustice, wrote in a statement announcing the appeal filed in the D.C. Circuit Court.

would have a conflict of interest and shouldn’t be allowed to serve on various scientific panels that advise the EPA.

The move outraged science and environmental advocates who countered that the policy would sideline some of the nation’s top researchers while paving the way for industry-funded scientists to gain more influence at the EPA.

A July report from the Government Accountability Office found the EPA increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure the appointees met ethics requirements.

But the Trump administration has already had a victory in court.

A judge previously ruled that the scientists involved in the case have no recourse because EPA’s decision is not subject to court review.

Earthjustice argues the EPA’s rule on conflicts of interest violates ethics rules and the procedure for changing them.

EPA did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A similar suit from the Natural Resources Defense Council was filed in June. That case is still being litigated.

The legal battles come at a time when many critics argue that such committees are under attack by the Trump administration.

A recent executive order signed by Trump directs all federal agencies to cut their advisory boards by at least one-third.

Those boards are often filled by people considered to be at the top of their fields who can provide important technical advice to various departments as they consider crafting a wide variety of policies.

Tensions between the boards and the agencies they advise have been particularly high at the EPA.

Members of the Science Advisory Board recently pushed back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public."
Acting DHS secretary on ICE facility attack in Texas: Rhetoric must be toned down,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-ice-facility-attack-texas,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends"" that the latest attack on an ICE facility in Texas could be the result of politicians and pundits ""demonizing"" federal agents for enforcing existing laws.

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."

New Jersey Paralegal Allegedly Used DOJ Access to Help Son’s Gang Identify “Snitches”,https://slate.com,['Molly Olmstead'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-jersey-gang-paralegal-doj-access-snitches.html,"The state seal of New Jersey. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Wikipedia.

A paralegal in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office has been accused of using her government access to identify people in her son’s gang who cooperated with investigators, putting them in danger of retaliation from their fellow gang members, according to filings in a federal court in Brooklyn. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Tawanna Hilliard, 44, used her access to Department of Justice computers to search databases to identify cooperating witnesses from the 5-9 Brims, a set of the Bloods street gang, at the direction of members of that gang. According to NJ.com, Hilliard had worked in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney Office’s Civil Division for nine years.

Hilliard also specifically targeted the co-defendant in a robbery case that resulted in her son, Tyquan, being sentenced to 10 years in prison. In May 2018, the man and Tyquan Hilliard robbed an AT&T store in Monticello, New York. The men threatened the store clerk and two shoppers with a gun and bound them with duct tape in a storage room. They fled the scene and led the police on a high-speed chase before crashing their car and being captured.

Texts between the mother and son allegedly show Tawanna Hilliard complaining that the co-defendant’s cooperation with the investigators after the robbery ruined her son’s defense. The man was “giving up murders, victims, shooters and all…SMH,” she wrote in a text, according to court documents. Tawanna Hilliard allegedly responded by posting a video on YouTube of the co-defendant talking to investigators about that robbery, with the title “NYC Brim Gang Member Snitching Pt. 1.” The man and his family then received death threats from other inmates linked to the Bloods, according to prosecutors.

According to NJ.com, the indictment contends that before his arrest, Hilliard told her son in an April 2016 call that she had “looked up” cases for another gang member who wanted to locate people who “snitched.”

Hilliard has been charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and obtaining information from a government computer. She was released on bond with the order not to contact her son or other gang members. Her son is also charged in the indictment."

President Trump does NOT cheat on the golf course ... so says golf legend John Daly, who golfed with POTUS this week.

Trump's honesty on the golf course has been called into question many, many times in the past ... with former golf partners like Samuel L. Jackson and Oscar De La Hoya flat out saying they witnessed Trump cheat.

Rick Reilly even wrote a book -- a freakin' book -- about Trump's alleged cheating.

But, John Daly -- who's been friends with the Prez for years and golfed with him at Trump National in NJ on Monday -- tells TMZ Sports, it just ain't true.

""It's funny how these people say, 'does he cheat?' Well, when he goes out and plays, if he hits a bad shot, he might hit a Mulligan, but he doesn't count it when we're playing the match.""

For those not down with the golf lingo ... a mulligan is essentially a redo after a bad shot.

The 2-time Majors winner doubled down, and called out someone else who was in the Oval Office.

""It's just amazing that people call him a cheat in golf. You wanna call a cheat in golf? I'll tell ya, Bill Clinton, he took a Mulligan on putts, chips, when I played with him.""

""I don't think Bill Clinton could've broken 100. At least the President, Mr. Trump, he can shoot 80. 78 to 84, probably.""

DOJ reassigns warden after Epstein's apparent suicide,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457281-doj-reassigns-warden-after-epstein-apparent-suicide,"Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrAttorney General Barr's license to kill Medical examiner confirms Epstein death by suicide Justice Dept. says Mueller report has been downloaded 800 million times MORE has ordered the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily reassign the warden at the New York federal prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was found dead over the weekend pending federal investigations into his apparent suicide.

Two staff members assigned to Epstein’s unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in lower Manhattan have also been placed on administrative leave, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Tuesday, noting additional actions may be taken if warranted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) disclosed the developments Tuesday afternoon, one day after Barr expressed outrage over Epstein's death and spoke of “serious irregularities"" at the federal prison in New York.

“I was appalled — indeed, the entire department was — and, frankly, angry to learn of the MCC’s failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and that demand a thorough investigation,” Barr said during remarks at a law enforcement conference in New Orleans on Monday morning.

“We will get to the bottom of what happened at the MCC and we will hold people accountable for this failure,” Barr said.

Kupec said Tuesday that the MCC warden, whose name is Lamine N'diaye, would be reassigned to the bureau’s Northeast Regional Office while the FBI and Justice Department inspector general investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death.

James Petrucci has been named acting warden of the MCC, the Justice Department added.

“The Bureau of Prisons also placed on administrative leave two MCC staff assigned to Mr. Epstein’s unit pending the outcome of the investigations. Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,"" Kupec said.

Epstein, a registered sex offender following an earlier conviction in 2008, was found dead of apparent suicide in his cell early Saturday morning. He had been placed on suicide watch back in late July after reportedly being found with marks on his neck.

The developments over the weekend have triggered questions about the circumstances of his death and massive scrutiny of the conditions at the detention facility.

Various reports have described the federal jail as being short-staffed and some have suggested that corrections officers did not follow protocol by regularly checking on Epstein during his detention.

Epstein, a wealthy financier with ties to multiple powerful people, had been held at the detention facility since July 6 when he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. His death cuts short a high-profile criminal prosecution, though Barr insisted Monday that prosecutors would continue their investigation into the sex trafficking allegations.

“Let me assure you this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” Barr said. “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.”

"Only bottled water for Newark residents, EPA says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Georeen Tanner'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/epa-tells-newark-provide-bottled-water,"Just over a year ago, Newark officials declared the city's water was ""absolutely safe to drink,"" but last week environmental officials called on the city to advise residents with known or suspected lead service lines that the filters they had been provided were not reliable after elevated lead levels were discovered in two Newark homes.

For three years the New Jersey city has been mired in a crisis caused by high levels of lead in the drinking water. The water filter program meant to answer the call for safer water has failed to solve the problem.

UK BABY LOSES ALL 4 LIMBS FOLLOWING HORRIFIC SEPSIS INFECTION

Now, in a move that echoes Flint, Mich., the city is distributing bottled water.

Last fall, the city distributed water filters to residents to reduce lead levels in drinking water while it implemented new corrosion control methods.

According to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, lead exposure is devastating. Lead serves no purpose in the human body and there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Children are especially at risk of its deadly effects. Early exposure can have lifelong consequences, such as intellectual disabilities, the agency says.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) letter, the agency is “unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their health is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices.”

The EPA places the onus to provide bottled water to Newark residents on the city.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka that he is prepared to make bottled water available to residents. He further stated that Newark is expanding the testing of filtered drinking water to more Newark homes and that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is “working with the filter manufacturer to determine the scope of the situation.”

The city handed out nearly 40,000 PUR water filters, half of which were donated by the company. In a statement, PUR said it has been “working diligently with the City of Newark to understand the situation, assist with the establishment of testing protocols for additional sampling, and help them determine next steps.” PUR says its faucet filters are “independently tested and certified by NSF International (NSF) to remove 99 percent of lead at levels up to 10 times the applicable federal and state drinking water standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb).”

Erik Olson, senior director of health programs at Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), is “troubled” by these developments. NRDC, an environmental group, sued Newark last year for failing to comply with regulations for the control of lead in drinking water.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN WITH DEADLY MOSQUITO-BORNE VIRUS IN A COMA, DAUGHTER SAYS

“Everyone in Newark deserves safe drinking water,” Olson said, in a statement. “We welcome EPA’s recent letter stating that Newark residents with lead service lines should be provided bottled water, though we do not understand why EPA does not insist on protecting other at-risk people such as those with lead plumbing and whose water tests high for lead. We also continue to be concerned about risks to residents in the eastern part of the City, the Wanaque service area.”

The bottled water distribution targets families served by the Pequannock water system with lead service lines who have received filters. Other Newark residents are served by the Wanaque water system, which was not prioritized for filters.

Newark does not know why the filters are failing, but one resident is not surprised by the turn of events.

“We’ve been telling them this for the last two years, but we were looked at as crazy,” said Debra Salters, a member of advocacy group Newark Water Coalition.

“We told [city officials] to give out bottled water and now they’re talking about they’re only giving out two cases. That’ll be gone by the end of the night,"" she said.

According to Salters, residents must show two forms of identification to collect water. She believes that complicates an already alarming situation.

“You couldn’t listen to the residents who pay your salary. You had to wait until the federal government put their foot on your neck and made you do something,” Salters said. “This is a life crisis.”

A reduction of lead levels is expected by the end of this year as stated in Murphy’s and Baraka’s statement. They are “optimistic” that the new corrosion control treatment will “prevent leaching from lead pipes.”"
VA Partners With DoD to Upgrade Supply Chain at High Risk for Abuse,https://www.military.com,['Richard Sisk'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/14/va-partners-dod-upgrade-supply-chain-high-risk-abuse.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the Defense Department this week to upgrade its supply chain system, which is perennially on a government watchdog agency's ""high risk"" list for waste, fraud and abuse.

The partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will give the VA access to the DLA's worldwide procurement system in an effort to streamline the VA's purchase of everything from medical and surgical supplies to cleaning equipment and construction materials, the VA said in a news release Monday.

""This is a huge step forward in our efforts to transform VA into a modern, high-performing organization by simplifying operations and leveraging DoD's supply chain system to support our veterans,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

Army Lt. Gen. Darrell Williams, director of the DLA, said the agreement would help the VA reduce costs for supplies.

Related content:

""On behalf of DoD, we are proud to be a value-add to VA on behalf of America's veterans,"" he said in a statement.

The VA release said the DLA will help ""create a centralized ordering system for VA"" aimed at ""reducing risk, waste, fraud and abuse in purchasing medical equipment and supplies,"" problems that have plagued the system for years and repeatedly been cited by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

In March, the GAO again put the VA on its biennial ""high risk"" list of agencies and departments whose practices are open to abuse; it also added a new area of concern at the VA -- acquisition management.

""VA's procurement policies have historically been outdated, disjointed and difficult for contracting officers to use,"" the GAO report states.

In 2017, the department launched a new program aimed at overhauling its supply chain system to achieve $150 million in cost reductions, the GAO noted.

However, the GAO reported in November 2017 that the new program ""was rushed, lacked key stakeholder involvement and buy-in, and relied on establishing non-competitive blanket purchase agreements for the overwhelming majority of products, resulting in low utilization by medical centers.""

The VA's Office of Inspector General was particularly scathing in a series of 2017 reports on supply chain scandals at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center.

IG Michael Missal found the problems at the Washington VA so troubling that he took the unusual step of issuing preliminary findings prior to the final report to alert the Veterans Health Administration to a situation ""sufficient to potentially compromise patient safety.""

The final report concluded that no patients were harmed but found that $150 million in supplies had never been inventoried, storage areas were filthy, and there was no system for ensuring that defective medical instruments and supplies were not used on patients.

Poor oversight of the medical supply system led to shortages in operating rooms at the hospital, according to the report. At one point, the operating room ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow.

In addition, the hospital had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries and also ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, forcing staff to go to a private-sector hospital to procure them, the report added.
