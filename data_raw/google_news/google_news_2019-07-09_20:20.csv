"Trump Can’t Block Critics From His Twitter Account, Appeals Court Rules",https://www.nytimes.com,['Charlie Savage'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-twitter-first-amendment.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from following his Twitter account because they criticized or mocked him, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The ruling could have broader implications for how the First Amendment applies to the social-media era.

Because Mr. Trump uses Twitter to conduct government business, he cannot exclude some Americans from reading his posts — and engaging in conversations in the replies to them — because he does not like their views, a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled unanimously.

Writing for the panel, Judge Barrington D. Parker noted that the conduct of the government and its officials are subject today to a “wide-open, robust debate” that “generates a level of passion and intensity the likes of which have rarely been seen.”

The First Amendment prohibits an official who uses a social media account for government purposes from excluding people from an “otherwise open online dialogue” because they say things the official disagrees with, he wrote."
Tom Steyer officially announces presidential bid,https://www.cnn.com,['David Wright'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/tom-steyer-presidential-campaign/index.html,"(CNN) Billionaire Tom Steyer officially entered the presidential race on Tuesday, saying he would seek the Democratic nomination for president despite having previously ruled out a run in January.

In a video released Tuesday morning , Steyer said, ""if you think that there's something absolutely critical, try as hard as you can and let the chips fall where they may. And that's exactly what I'm doing. My name's Tom Steyer, and I'm running for president.""

Steyer, who has teased political bids before without ever launching a campaign, never fully ruled out a 2020 run despite his January announcement, a source familiar with the situation previously told CNN

Steyer has operated as a funding force in Democratic politics in recent years, bankrolling candidates and organizations that promote liberal causes, including the impeachment of President Donald Trump . Steyer's net worth reached $1.6 billion this year according to Forbes, a fortune he began amassing in 1986 when he launched his hedge fund Farallon Capital.

The 2018 House races, which Steyer spent over $100 million on, marked the third consecutive election cycle in which Steyer spent millions supporting Democratic candidates. But it's Steyer's efforts to impeach Trump which have made him the most visible, starring in self-funded television commercials in which he calls on Congress to remove the President from office.

Steyer joins a crowded Democratic primary that has already participated in the first round of primary debates.

A CNN poll last month showed former Vice President Joe Biden leading the race with 22% support followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who made steep gains following their debate performances.

Steyer's late entry to the race makes it highly unlikely that he will qualify for the second round of Democratic debates hosted by CNN, set for the end of July. To make the stage in under three weeks, he'll need to receive campaign contributions from 65,000 individuals and receive 1% support in at least three DNC-approved polls.

And Steyer will face immediate resistance by the already-crowded Democratic field. The New York Times reported that Steyer has pledged to spend $100 million on his bid, putting him directly at odds with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has sworn off private, high-dollar fundraising events during her primary campaign, and vocally criticized the political influence of billionaires and corporations.

In January, Warren said: ""No to the billionaires, whether they are self-funding or whether they're funding PACs. We are the Democratic Party, and that is the party of the people. That's how we not only win elections, that's how we build movements that make real change.""

And asked about Steyer's possible entry to the race on Monday, Warren said that ""every one of us should be held responsible for the kind of campaign we run. Period.""

She continued, ""I'm careful about what I say about other Democrats, but there's a second part. I don't go to closed-door fundraisers, I don't hang out with millionaires and corporate CEOs. I'm building a grassroots movement and I think as Democrats we should ask that of every single one of them. Do this grassroots style.""

Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bet-founder-robert-johnson-says-democratic-party-moved-too-far-to-the-left,"Black Entertainment Television founder and longtime Democrat Robert Johnson said in an interview that aired Tuesday that the Democratic Party has become too liberal to defeat President Trump in 2020, unless major changes are made.

“The party in my opinion, for me personally, has moved too far to the left,” Johnson told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble.

AOC RESPONDS AFTER PELOSI BLASTS FAR-LEFT DEMS' 'TWITTER WORLD'

Johnson – the country’s first African-American billionaire, according to Forbes – went on to say that because the party has become so liberal, he isn’t supporting a particular 2020 candidate at this time.

“I think at the end of the day, if a Democrat is going to beat Trump, then that person, he or she, will have to move to the center and you can’t wait too long to do that,” Johnson said. “The message of some of the programs that Democrats are pushing are not resonating with the majority of the American people.”

Johnson said the current far-left state of the Democratic Party will work well in the primaries but won’t help in a general election, especially since he feels Trump has his base locked up. The BET founder, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, even praised some of Trump’s recent accomplishments.

“I think the economy is doing great, and it’s particularly reaching populations that heretofore had very bad problems in terms of jobs and employments and the opportunities that come with employment,” Johnson said. “African-American unemployment is at its lowest level… I give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that’s benefiting a large amount of Americans.”

Johnson also told CNBC that he thinks tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy, whereas partisan politics have gone too far.

“I think business people have more confidence in the way the economy is going,” Johnson said. “If business people are concerned about anything, it’s the clear, clear partisan politics that’s become very wicked and very mean.”

Johnson said he gives Trump an “A+” for the economy but added that divisive politics are “not helping America as a global nation.”

The House Judiciary Committee will vote on Thursday to authorize subpoenas for 12 of former special counsel Robert Mueller's witnesses — including President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his former deputy Rod Rosenstein, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former chief of staff John Kelly and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

Each of the witnesses provided crucial testimony to Mueller about Trump's efforts to thwart the Russia investigation, and the committee's efforts are certain to meet resistance from a White House that has already blocked testimony from senior aides like former White House Counsel Don McGahn and former longtime adviser Hope Hicks.

Story Continued Below

The barrage of subpoena authorizations represents a major expansion of the committee’s Trump-focused investigation, casting a wider net from obstruction of justice to hush-money payments. The committee has faced repeated resistance from the White House as it investigates obstruction of justice allegations against the president.

A majority of the committee’s Democrats already favor launching formal impeachment proceedings against the president, and the number is likely to grow after Mueller testifies next week before the Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

The subpoena targets include two executives of American Media, Inc. — Dylan Howard and David Pecker — who testified about Trump's alleged hush-money payments to a woman who accused him of an extramarital affair before the election. And it includes current and former Trump administration officials Rick Dearborn, Jody Hunt and Rob Porter.

The list also includes Keith Davidson, an attorney who previously represented adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen orchestrated a $130,000 payment to Daniels to buy her silence over an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen is serving a three year prison sentence in part for the hush-money payment, which prosecutors said amounted to a campaign finance violation.

Davidson previously said he had asked the committee for a so-called “friendly” subpoena in order to comply with the committee’s demands for documents and testimony.

“As always, I remain open to reaching a reasonable accommodation and will not issue subpoenas if the information we are seeking is voluntarily provided. We will get answers one way or the other,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.

Republicans panned the subpoenas as an effort to “relitigate” the Mueller investigation.

“Mr. Mueller’s team issued more than 2,800 subpoenas before concluding that no Americans conspired with Russia,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. “Even if Chairman Nadler still believes subpoenas are conversation starters, it’s hard to imagine this handful of subpoenas will do anything but reinforce the principal conclusions we’ve been able to read about for months.”

Though the current and former White House aides are likely to refuse to comply with the committee’s demands, that decision is more complicated for figures like Lewandowski, who has had no official role with the Trump White House yet remains a top confidant of the president.

Mueller relied on testimony from Lewandowski and Hicks to recount an episode in which Trump tried to pressure Sessions to assume control of the Russia probe and dramatically constrain its scope. Additionally, Porter, who served as White House staff secretary, turned over his contemporaneous notes which detailed Trump’s frustrations with the Mueller investigation and his efforts to thwart it.

The committee has already subpoenaed McGahn for testimony and documents, but the former White House counsel refused to comply at the direction of the Trump White House. The Judiciary Committee has vowed to take McGahn to court to enforce its subpoena, but the panel has taken no action since McGahn blew off their subpoena deadline in May.

The House Intelligence Committee has also subpoenaed Flynn for documents and testimony, but the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has repeatedly declined to say whether Flynn, who is awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI, is cooperating.

Barr says DOJ would back Mueller if he decides not to testify,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-testify-census-question,"Attorney General William Barr said in an interview Monday that the Justice Department would support Robert Mueller if he decides he ""doesn't want to subject himself"" to questioning from congressional Democrats at a planned July 17 hearing.

Barr's comments raised the dramatic possibility that Mueller would pull out of the questioning at the last minute -- a potential coup for Democrats, as some Republicans and commentators have said Mueller's testimony could end up revealing fundamental problems with his now-closed investigation.

Although Mueller no longer was a DOJ employee, the Trump administration could still limit testimony about decisions made while he was special counsel. Barr indicated the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the former special counsel's team but did not say Mueller's testimony would be restricted in any way.

At the same time, a Mueller pullout would avert an unnecessary ""public spectacle,"" Barr told The Associated Press, given that Mueller has stated publicly that his exhaustive report on 2016 foreign election interference spoke for itself.

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, however, has countered that Mueller's remarks could be necessary. Sekulow, in a Fox News op-ed last month, pushed for answers as to when exactly Mueller learned there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia -- and why Mueller's team hinted in sworn court filings even late into the investigation that such collusion remained a tantalizing possibility.

TRUMP ATTY JAY SEKULOW: HERE'S THE QUESTIONS MUELLER MUST BE ASKED ON JULY 17

""I'm not sure what purpose is served by dragging him up there and trying to grill him,"" Barr asserted. ""I don't think Mueller should be treated that way or subject himself to that, if he doesn't want to.""

Mueller's 448-page report, released with redactions in April, found no proof that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian actors to influence the election, despite multiple outreach efforts by Russians, and did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Even so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Monday that Barr's remarks were ""no surprise.""

""Barr misled the public about Mueller's report, and wants his own deception to stand,"" Schiff wrote, referring to Barr's decision to release an initial summary of Mueller's report shortly before publishing the complete, redacted version. ""The public has a right to hear the truth, from Mueller himself, about Trump's misconduct and ongoing national security risks.""

In a news conference this past May, Mueller defended Barr's decision to release the summary: ""At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released,"" Mueller said. ""The attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once. We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.""

MUELLER SUBPOENA COULD BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS, SAY POLITICAL, LEGAL EXPERTS

Barr's additionally said he still saw a legal path forward for requiring 2020 Census respondents to declare whether or not they're citizens. The Justice Department announced Sunday it was putting together a new legal team to spearhead its effort to ask the citizenship question after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the move.

The justices said the administration's justification for the question ""seems to have been contrived,"" but implied they would consider additional arguments from the White House.

The new legal team, named in court papers, included Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Morrell, a former Trump White House lawyer and law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas; Christopher Bates, who previously worked for Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and four career Justice Department attorneys: Glenn Girdharry, Colin Kisor, Christopher Reimer and Daniel Schiffer.

James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department's civil division who had been leading the team, had told Barr that a number of people who'd been litigating the case preferred ""not to continue during this new phase,"" the attorney general said.

Barr would not detail the new team's precise plans, though a senior official told The Associated Press that Trump was expected to issue a memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question on census forms. Barr said he didn't have details on why the attorneys didn't want to continue, but ""as far as I know, they don't think we are legally wrong.""

Many Democrats have said a citizenship question would deter illegal immigrants from filling out census forms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday that Trump wanted to add the demand for citizenship information because he wanted to ""make America white again.""

Census data counts all residents, including illegal immigrants, and is used to determine congressional apportionments and the makeup of the Electoral College. Although illegal immigrants cannot vote, their children become citizens automatically if born in the United States under a practice known as birthright citizenship -- which the Trump administration separately has called into question.

OPINION: WHY ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL

The Trump administration has argued it wanted the citizenship question included to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. However, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal members in last month's Supreme Court decision, openly skeptical about that justification.

Pelosi, meanwhile, said in a letter to colleagues that the full House would be moving forward with a vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress after the administration failed to comply with subpoenas regarding the census question.

Barr spoke to the AP after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, South Carolina, where he met with inmates and staff members to discuss the criminal justice reform law that Congress approved and Trump signed into law last year.

Separately, Barr revealed that he recused himself from the Jeffrey Epstein criminal case ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, said Monday that the U.S. government could run out of money in two months if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)

The U.S. government could run out of money to pay all of its bills by early September if Congress doesn’t rush to raise the debt ceiling, a think tank said Monday, a time frame that could force lawmakers to act much sooner than planned.

The Bipartisan Policy Center said that the Treasury Department could breach the borrowing limit in two months because the government has brought in far less tax revenue this year than was projected. The BPC uses economic models to forecast the government’s ability to pay its bills, and its estimates are often studied by the White House and congressional leaders.

In May, it had projected that Treasury would have until October or November before it ran into debt ceiling problems.

[Hiring rebounds in June, easing fears of a U.S. recession]

Congressional negotiations to raise the debt ceiling bogged down in recent weeks, with some leaders hoping to package a debt limit increase with a broader budget package. Those talks have faltered amid disagreements with the White House, and it is unclear when they plan to hold a vote.

But if lawmakers heed the BPC’s warning about the debt ceiling, they could be forced to raise the borrowing limit before a lengthy break in August. Senior GOP senators said Monday that the new projected timeline could increase pressure on Congress to act.

“That could change the dynamic,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). “We cannot default. That would send chaos through the financial markets.""

G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the BPC, said tax revenue, particularly money paid by corporations, has lagged far behind estimates and has provided Treasury much less cash than expected. When the government collects less money in taxes, it has less money to pay its bills. Typically, it would address this by borrowing more money, but its ability to do this is limited because Congress hasn’t raised the debt limit.

Even though there have been numerous political showdowns over the debt ceiling, Congress and the White House have never breached the limit. Financial experts have projected that failing to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a stock market crash and a spike in interest rates. The Treasury is expected to run a deficit of roughly $900 billion this year because spending far outpaces tax collection, and borrowing costs would also shoot higher.

BPC officials said it was difficult to pinpoint when exactly the Treasury would run out of money. While they said there was a “significant” chance the government would run out of funds in the first half of September, they said the more likely scenario is that it would have enough until sometime in October. If Treasury can make it through early September, it is expected to receive billions of dollars in tax payments that are due in late September, giving it a bit more flexibility. They said it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely when the debt ceiling would be breached because hundreds of billions of dollars come in and out of the government each month.

Still, Hoagland said, lawmakers “might want to seriously consider quicker action than waiting until early October.”

“We just want to raise the red flag to be very cautious and careful about what action they may want to take before too long,” he said.

[‘This doesn’t look like the best economy ever’: 40% of Americans say they still struggle to pay bills]

The government makes millions of payments each month, from Social Security benefits to interest payments on its debt. During a debt ceiling standoff with Congress, the Obama administration considered prioritizing payments to minimize the disruption for financial markets. But Democrats and Republicans have stressed that there is no way to contain the fallout from a debt ceiling breach given that U.S. debt is considered to be one of the safest investments.

BPC officials outlined twin risks if the debt ceiling isn’t increased. They said it could lead to a cessation of benefits for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly, but also a stock market crash that could hurt the investments of millions of Americans.

Congress is scheduled to go into recess for much of August and not return until after Labor Day weekend in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling for months, but his overtures have not been met with much enthusiasm by Democrats or Republicans. He has also told lawmakers that the debt ceiling could be breached in September.

The looming debt ceiling threat has caused growing concern on Capitol Hill, especially since it nearly coincides with a Sept. 30 deadline when the federal government will begin to shut down unless new spending legislation is passed. Lawmakers also want to avert onerous spending caps that threaten to slash $126 billion from domestic and military budgets early next year absent a deal.

But there are differences between Republicans and Democrats -- and between GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration -- over the best way to proceed. Trump administration officials recently proposed raising the debt ceiling while extending existing federal spending levels for a year, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called that approach “unacceptable” because the Pentagon wouldn’t get enough money. At the same time, Republicans have chafed at Democrats’ demands for higher domestic spending levels.

All that has left the path forward unclear even as lawmakers express increasing urgency as their annual August recess approaches.

“I think we need to hustle to a (budget) caps deal as soon as we possibly can and include the debt limit in it, no doubt,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Monday evening after emerging from a Senate GOP leadership meeting where the issues were discussed. “I don’t think it’s in anybody’s best interest to have that fight in September up against the deadline.”

In 2018, Congress suspended the debt ceiling until March 2019. Because that date has passed, Treasury has taken numerous steps to avoid defaulting on obligations by moving money around or delaying certain costs. But Treasury will eventually run out of ways to buy more time.

The U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through revenue, and it covers the difference by borrowing money. It borrows by issuing debt, but it can do so only up to a limit set by Congress."

DOJ files to halt Trump suit demanding financial documents,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-financial-documents-department-of-justice,"The Justice Department on Monday challenged a federal judge's decision to allow a case accusing President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency to move forward, asking an appeals court to take up the case instead.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright, calling the case dealing with a Revolutionary War-era clause ""extraordinary.""

The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, which would force Trump-related entities such as his New York and D.C. hotels, Trump Tower, the Trump Organization, and Mar-a-Lago Club to turn over business tax returns, receipts and other documents.

Justice lawyers said in the filings that answering their 37 subpoena requests in the interim, by July 29, would cause Trump ""irreparable injury"" and distract him from his official duties.

CUOMO SIGNS BILL ALLOWING CONGRESS TO GET TRUMP TAX RETURNS

This is the second time Justice lawyers have petitioned a higher court to take up a case dealing with the emoluments clause, which bans government officials from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress' permission. Last December, the federal appeals court agreed to hear a similar case out of a Maryland federal court that had also reached such a point. In the meantime, a stay on proceedings was also allowed.

The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who is also chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

""Our goal is simple and straightforward -- stopping President Trump from putting a `For Sale' sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office,"" Blumenthal said in a statement Monday. ""Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.""

The Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.

RUSH LIMBAUGH: 'EUROPEAN ELITES' THREATENED BY 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'

The filing of a writ of mandamus is considered an ""extraordinary remedy,"" according to the Justice Department's website, which ""should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Among the judges who sit on the appeals court, includes chief judge is Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court was not allowed to be heard by Republicans.

The filing seeking for a writ of mandamus comes two weeks after Sullivan ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings. For Justice to succeed at the appeals level, they must meet a demanding standard that would partly rest on showing Sullivan's decisions to be clearly wrong and that there's no adequate alternative for relief in the case.

They have argued that the court has ignored ""unique separation-of-powers concerns"" involved in having members of one branch of government conducting discovery against the president in his official capacity. The government also wrote in their filing that the legislature itself must bring such a case, ""not an amalgam of individual legislators or even a single chamber of a bicameral body.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.



SEAN SPICER: 2020 ELECTION IS CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP'S ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DEMS' LEFT TURN TOWARD SOCIALISM

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The District of Columbia case is one of three that argues the president is violating the emoluments clause, but this case is notable because the plaintiffs in this suit -- members of Congress -- are mentioned in the clause itself. The Democrats' attorneys have argued that Congress not only has a right but is required, as part of their jobs, to weigh in on potential emoluments to Trump such as a $6.5 million condo purchase by the Qatari government or a Chinese-government owned company's investment in a project that will include a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia.

Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the Democrats suing the president are not being injured by him at all but by their colleagues in Congress, who have refused to take up the emoluments issue. And the government has contended that Trump's business activity such as hotel room earnings don't qualify under the constitutional definition of emoluments.

Blumenthal said the subpoenas seeking information in the case are ""targeted"" to get information that ensures the president isn't avoiding his constitutional responsibility to ask Congress to approve any emoluments. The aim of the subpoenas is to trace ownership interests and money flowing to Trump from foreign governments and their representatives.

The subpoenas were seeking the terms governing the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and related information, and aimed to determine trademarks granted to Trump or his companies by foreign governments since Jan. 20, 2017, and all pending applications for foreign trademarks.

The Justice Department asked the court in its filing Monday for a ruling regarding their request for a stay on the subpoenas by July 22 -- one week before the official response deadline -- ""in order to provide time to seek relief from the Supreme Court if necessary,"" an indication that the governments attorneys may be willing to elevate the case to the highest court if there is any indication they won't succeed at the appeals court."
Former DOJ Lawyer Says Census Drama Put Attorneys in “Completely Untenable” Position,https://slate.com,['Jeremy Stahl'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-census-william-barr-john-roberts-lawyer-change.html,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington. Joe Raedle/Getty Images

The latest bizarre twist in the Census citizenship question case came on Sunday when the Department of Justice announced that the entire team of lawyers defending the government’s position in ongoing litigation would be replaced. The highly unusual move was confirmed on Monday in a series of court filings. It is likely at the behest of career officials uncomfortable with the government’s position moving forward, according to former DOJ attorneys. The lawyers on the case told the courts last week that the administration would stop trying to add the citizenship question to the census, but were quickly forced to reverse that position after President Donald Trump tweeted that reports of the decision to back down were “fake.” The sudden change in lawyers suggests there is some internal recognition that the government’s latest census stance has become untenable.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec announced the change on Sunday, declaring that Attorney General William Barr “is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion [as the previous team] as the cases progress.”

The government has been tight-lipped about the reasons behind the switch. According to multiple former DOJ officials, however, the move would have only come if the attorneys who had been working on the case had profound reservations about the task ahead and asked to be removed.

“It’s an extremely unusual thing for an entire office to take itself off of a case in the middle of a case,” one former DOJ attorney, who worked under this administration, told Slate. “[These are] attorneys with the highest standards of integrity and highest standards of professionalism. I can only imagine they were in the very difficult position of being forced to contradict factual representations they had made previously.”

“That the entire office is being substituted out really indicates […] something strange,” the former attorney, who requested anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions, added.

Another former DOJ official also speculated to the New York Times that the unusual move was likely because the original legal team was refusing to reverse course.

“There is no reason they would be taken off that case unless they saw what was coming down the road and said, ‘I won’t sign my name to that,’ ” Justin Levitt, a former senior official in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times on Sunday.

The Times further confirmed that not only would career officials from the DOJ’s federal programs branch—the branch normally responsible for defending administration policies in court—be leaving the case, but a completely new branch would be taking over.

Indeed, it has become clear over the past week that the DOJ would need to argue positions that completely contradict those previously taken in court by the original team. Last month, the Supreme Court remanded the decision about the citizenship question back to the Commerce Department after Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s more liberal wing to determine that the department had unlawfully “contrived” its reason for adding the question to the census. Since the justices essentially ruled the original explanation—that the question was added to aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—was a lie, any renewed effort to add the question would require DOJ attorneys to acknowledge their past position had been false and represent that a new one was the true motivation all along.

Faced with this challenge, both the DOJ and Commerce Department seemed to take Roberts’ ruling as their cue to drop the case last week, even representing in court that the 2020 census forms would be printed without the question and no further attempts to add it would go forward. DOJ lawyers reportedly spent the July Fourth holiday scrambling to find a new justification that would pass legal muster following Trump’s comments to the contrary.

The final substantive legal filing from the old legal team came on Friday, when that team argued in court that a renewed equal protection claim was now “moot” because of the Supreme Court’s decision, and thus that discovery should not go forward in a reopened equal protection claim in Maryland. That element of the case was revived late last month after the uncovering of previously secret evidence that the citizenship question had been concocted to offer “a disadvantage to the Democrats” and be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” After that evidence was found, Maryland District Judge George Hazel reopened the discrimination claim, and on Friday he ordered renewed discovery on that question to begin immediately and run through Aug. 19.

Administration attorneys had repeatedly insisted in court that they had a firm deadline of July 1 to print the census forms. Now, the new lawyers will apparently have to concede that this deadline was not real. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, for example, had told the Supreme Court that a decision in the case had to be made by the end of June, rejecting claims by opponents of the citizenship question that the form could be finalized as late as Oct. 31 without additional congressional appropriations. As former Office of Legal Counsel attorney Marty Lederman has written, now that the deadline has come and gone, DOJ attorneys will have to go into court and essentially say, oops, just kidding, we can do this without further funds from Congress after all.

“Being in a position now to deny those statements is something that would have been really untenable,” the former DOJ attorney told Slate. “From the point of view of the court hearing the case, they’re going to hear some set of attorneys making some argument that ‘you should ignore everything we’ve been saying for the last year plus,’ and that’s going to be a difficult sell for whoever’s making it.”

The administration apparently thinks it will be easier for a new set of lawyers to argue the new position than the specific attorneys who had previously argued the opposite. “An administration official said the new legal team may find it easier to argue the administration’s new position,” the Associated Press reported on Monday.

Indeed, the former DOJ attorney said, being “in the position of contradicting factual positions they themselves have made to the court for those particular attorneys would just be a completely untenable position for them to be in.”"
U.S. State Department approves possible $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/u-s-state-department-approves-possible-2-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1U32HT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Taiwan of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an estimated value of $2.2 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday, despite Chinese criticism of the deal.

China’s foreign ministry expressed anger about the sale and urged the United States to revoke it. The timing is especially sensitive as the Washington and Beijing are seeking to resolve a bitter trade war.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, would not alter the basic military balance in the region.

DSCA notified Congress on Monday of the possible arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative tanks, heavy equipment transporters and related support.

Reuters reported last month that an informal notification of the proposed sale had been sent to the U.S. Congress.

The United States has no formal ties with self-ruled and democratic Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a serious violation of international law and a “crude interference in China’s internal affairs, harming China’s sovereignty and security interests.”

“China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this and has already made stern representations to the US side,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

“Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory and nobody should underestimate the Chinese government’s and people’s firm determination to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose foreign interference.”

China urged the United States to immediately revoke the planned arms sale and end all contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added.

Taiwan’s Presidential Office expressed “sincere gratitude” to the U.S. government for the arms sale.

“Taiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,” Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan’s president, said in a statement.

Related Coverage China calls on U.S. to withdraw arms sale to Taiwan

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.

The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taipei’s military raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said last month in a statement."
Obama-era DHS secretary hits 2020 Dem candidates for 'extreme' and 'unworkable' immigration ideas,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-era-dhs-secretary-hits-2020-dem-candidates-for-extreme-and-unworkable-immigration-ideas,"Jeh Johnson, who served as former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security secretary, called out Democratic presidential candidates for embracing ""extreme"" policies on immigration, like rejecting the deportation of those here illegally and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer July 08, 2019, 4:42:51 PM EDT



The latest Crop Progress from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offered little comfort to U.S. farmers dealing with a difficult planting season. For the fourth straight week, the condition of corn and soybeans was rated below 60%.

The rain and flooding that has impacted Corn Belt farmers has affected the percentage of corn considered “good” or “excellent” in 18 key corn-producing states. That number this week is 57%; the first rating of the season was 59%, followed by consecutive weeks at 56%. The condition of corn rated “good” or “excellent” last year at this time was 75%.

The condition of soybeans in 18 soybean-producing states considered “good” or “excellent” is 53%, compared to 54% last week. That figure was at 71% this time last year.

The bad news continues for Illinois, which is joined by Iowa as the top corn-producing states, typically accounting for about one-third of the U.S. crop, according to the USDA. The condition of corn in Illinois rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is just 37%, even lower than last week’s rating of 42%.

Other states with particularly poor corn condition data this week include Missouri (28%), Ohio (34%) and Indiana (38%). Those three states also had low percentages for the condition of soybeans, too: Ohio (28%), Missouri (35%) and Indiana (37%).

Next week’s numbers may not be much better.

It does look like they’ll get some helpful rains later next week.”

A new AccuWeather analysis predicts there will be 13.03 billion bushels of corn produced this year. That would be the lowest total since 2012 when 10.76 billion bushels of corn were harvested. In 2018, the total was 14.42 billion bushels.

The USDA’s 2019 corn production estimate as of June 28 is higher, at 13.88 billion bushels.

State Department launches panel focused on human rights and natural law,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'July At Pm']",07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-to-name-panel-focused-on-human-rights-and-natural-law/2019/07/06/3bfe001e-9f54-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in past remarks about the creation of his Commission on Unalienable Rights, said he felt it was important to evaluate “how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy.” (Jacquelyn Martin/AFP/Getty Images)

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announced the creation of an advisory commission on human rights that has engendered controversy since it was proposed.

Pompeo said the Commission on Unalienable Rights “will provide the intellectual grist of what I hope will be one of the most profound re-examinations of inalienable rights in the world since the 1948 Universal Declaration.”

The panel will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote a book about the United Nations’ 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pompeo was Glendon’s research assistant when he studied law at Harvard. Glendon is also a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

Besides her academic research, Glendon is known for her antiabortion views. At the 1995 U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing, she fought successfully to keep abortion from being listed as a human right.

In thanking Pompeo for the appointment, Glendon said this is a time when “basic human rights are being misunderstood by many, manipulated by many and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators.”

Some civil rights groups expressed concerns that the new commission could become a vehicle to chip away at same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Jamil Dakwar, head of the ACLU’s Human Rights Program, said it is an attempt to redefine human rights and “to roll back decades of progress in achieving full rights for marginalized communities.”

When the panel was first outlined in an internal State Department memo, the proposed chair was Robert P. George, a Princeton University professor who was a co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposed same-sex marriage, and a prominent antiabortion advocate.

A State Department official said that George will not be on the commission and that the panel will not weigh in on either issue.

“They will not make any pronouncements on gay marriage and abortion,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview plans for the commission.

Its work is likely to be heavily scrutinized, nevertheless. The commission’s job is to provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice published in May in the Federal Register.

The mention of natural law, a philosophy that all human beings are endowed with certain rights, set off alarm among advocates of legal abortion and same-sex marriage. The phrase is used by those who argue that basic human rights — such as free speech and the expectation that governments should not torture people — are made vulnerable when social goods such as education, health care and clean water are elevated to the characterization of human rights.

Daniel Philpott, a University of Notre Dame professor who was initially mentioned as a potential commission member, said that natural law reflects a concern that human rights have gone off the rails, in part because of abortion and claims about marriage rights.

“The idea is these claims of human rights are not based upon natural law or the truth of the human person,” he said. “In a sense, these are false claims to human rights. It brings down the cause of human rights in general. Why should we pursue other human rights if human rights can be anything one faction or party advocates them to be?”

Last month, five Democratic senators sent Pompeo a letter expressing concern about the commission’s focus on natural law, calling it “a term sometimes used in association with discrimination against marginalized populations.”

Proponents of a reassessment say perceptions of what qualifies as a human right have evolved since the days when it took a gross abuse, such as a gulag or apartheid, to raise significant concern. Pompeo appeared to endorse that view, saying the commission will ask the most basic of questions.

“What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right?” he said. “How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim, that this or that is a human right? Is it true and therefore ought it to be honored?”

The commission is composed of experts, philosophers and human rights activists from every political persuasion. Pompeo said their deliberations will be grounded in the nation’s “founding principles” and those included in the U.N. document on human rights.

“Every once in a while we need to step back and reflect seriously on where we are, where we’ve been and whether we’re headed in the right direction,” he said.

Pompeo bemoaned the continuing human rights violations that persist seven decades after the declaration was drafted and said multinational institutions that are supposed to police human rights have not proved up to the task amid confusion on what constitutes a human right.

“We must therefore be vigilant that human rights discourse not be corrupted or hijacked or used for dubious or malignant purposes,” he said.

The commission will get input from the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), which already produces annual reports rating countries on their records for human rights and religious liberty. Critics have wondered whether the volunteer panel will undermine the bureau, which for more than four decades has been responsible for holding abusive governments to account.

“We don’t need this commission,” said Michael Posner, the State Department’s assistant secretary for DRL from 2009 to 2013. “What we need is for the U.S. government, the secretary of state and the president to abide by and uphold international human rights standards we already have adopted.”

Modern human rights law is rooted both in religious concepts and experience. Many of the basic principles are embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which in turn formed the basis for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations after World War II and the Holocaust.

William L. Saunders, a human rights scholar at Catholic University who also was mentioned as a potential commission candidate, said that getting input from experts outside of government is sensible.

“I would think the Universal Declaration will guide and shape reflection by the new commission,” he said in an email.

Pompeo has spoken out about human rights abuses in some countries, including China’s detention of Uighur Muslims, Iran’s treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, and the repressive policies of Cuba and Venezuela.

“The distinctive mark of Western civilization is the belief in the inherent worth of human beings, with the attendant respect for God-authored rights and liberties,” Pompeo said in a May speech at the Claremont Institute. “Indeed, the Declaration says that ‘all men are created equal.’ And we ought to help nations protect these first things — and human rights, as well.”

Critics, however, have faulted him for not saying more about abuses committed by governments friendly to the United States. The administration’s response to last year’s killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi remains a particular concern.

“When Mr. Khashoggi gets murdered in Turkey and we know there’s a senior Saudi leader, the crown prince, involved, we ought to be saying something about it,” said Posner, the former DRL head. “When the government of the Philippines is executing thousands of people, we ought to be saying something. When a free press is denied a place in Turkey, we ought to say something.

“That’s what diplomacy is about,” he said. “That’s what DRL has done for 40-some years. The idea that we need fresh thinking or need to somehow revise and rethink what the principles are flies in the face of that history and experience.”"
DOJ abruptly replaces lawyers defending Trump census citizenship question,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Nick Visser']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/08/doj-abruptly-replaces-lawyers-defending-trump-census-citizenship-question/23765795/,"The Justice Department abruptly announced Sunday it will replace the legal team that has represented the Trump administration in its efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom.”

The department gave no reason for the switch, but the move is another dramatic shift in President Donald Trump’s effort to add the question to the census. The Washington Post on Sunday noted that a person familiar with the case said some of the department’s career attorneys were uncomfortable with the president’s insistence on the issue. The New York Times reported that no DOJ attorneys in the federal programs branch, which traditionally represents the government in court, will be on the census case as it advances in the courts.

“The Attorney General appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters, and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress,” Kupec said.

Last week, government lawyers told a federal judge the White House would continue to move forward with its efforts to add the fraught citizenship question to the census, despite legal obstacles. Days earlier the Trump administration said it would drop the question after a Supreme Court decision temporarily barred the government from adding it.

The Census Bureau began printing forms for the tally after the decision, and had long noted that it needed a decision by June 30, the agency’s printing deadline.

But the administration reversed course a day later. Trump called reports he was abandoning the question “FAKE!” and said he was pressing ahead. Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge on Friday that they would continue argue the case, and Trump said he was mulling various strategies to get the question approved, including an executive order.

So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2019

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We could also add an addition on. So we could start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we’re working on a lot of things including an executive order.”

Civil rights groups have vowed to fight the White House once again should it attempt to add the question. The ACLU has argued it is meant to intimidate people of color and immigrant communities and would result in a massive undercount of up to 6.5 million people.

The census, mandated by the Constitution to count everyone living in the U.S., is used to allocate federal resources and also to allot seats in the House of Representatives.

The Pentagon has not yet approved the request, which was made on Wednesday.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has consented to the use of the National Guard to support Customs and Border Protection, according to the Defense Department.

""Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,"" Maj. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesman, told CNN, while adding that ""these holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.""

The holding facilities ""house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities,"" Mitchell said.

The UK ambassador who called Trump 'inept' was reportedly disinvited from a Treasury Department dinner. The White House will have plenty more opportunities to shun him.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Alexandra Ma'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-ambassador-kim-darroch-disinvited-mnuchin-dinner-report-2019-7,"The British ambassador who called Trump ""inept,"" ""insecure,"" and ""incompetent"" in a series of leaked diplomatic cables was reportedly disinvited from a Monday dinner.

It appears to be a swift enactment of Trump's intention to freeze out Sir Kim Darroch, the first of many opportunities to show official displeasure.

Sir Kim Darroch was notably absent from a dinner that US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hosted for President Donald Trump and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, Bloomberg and CBS reporter Mark Knoller reported.

Both cited unnamed US officials who said his invitation had been rescinded. Darroch's invitation after Trump tweeted on Monday that "" we will no longer deal"" with the British ambassador, Bloomberg and Knoller said.

Trump's tweet did not make clear whether the administration would cut off all communication with Darroch. The White House has yet to respond to Business Insider's request for clarification.

Business Insider has contacted the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office for confirmation and comment.

Monday's dinner, which was held in the Treasury Department's historic Treasury Cash Room, was attended by US officials including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Transport Secretary Elaine Chao, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner facing charges of soliciting prostitution and paying for sex in Florida, was on Trump's table, photos of the event show.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF director nominated to lead the European Central Bank, was also pictured at the table.

""This is a who's who of people in business,"" Trump said of the attendees, according to White House pool reporters.

Freezing Darroch out of Washington?

Darroch's leaked memos have already irked the Trump administration, and his apparent disinvitation from Monday's dinner could be the start of the White House's campaign to shun him in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday further piled on Darroch, calling him in a series of tweets a ""a wacky Ambassador,"" ""not someone we are thrilled with,"" ""a very stupid guy,"" and ""a pompous fool.""

Prior to the leak the British ambassador had hosted many high-profile events, which were attended by White House officials including Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway, former Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Mnuchin, Politico reported.

Their past attendance seem to contradict Trump's claim on Monday that Darroch ""is not liked or well thought of within the US.""

However, now that the displeasure of the president has been noted publicly, Trump's inner circle may help make this a reality.

'There are no winners here'

Despite Trump's protestations, British Prime Minister Theresa May defended Darroch, saying that she has ""full faith"" in him even though she disagrees with his view of the president.

Leslie Vinjamuri, head of Chatham House's US and Americas program, told Business Insider: ""Britain will keep Sir Kim in Washington, and he will be marginalized on a daily basis.""

""There are no winners here. Not in America and not in London. The US and UK need each other,"" she added.

""Trump is now going to be doing a workaround. The question is whether he looks to others in the British government for an ally, or whether he simply looks beyond Britain.""

The New York Times cited unnamed British officials in the US as saying that the leak may have been engineered to ensure that Sir Mark Sedwill, the current head of the UK civil service and a longtime diplomat, was not appointed.

According to this theory, the leak may have been trying to encourage the UK to appoint a more pro-Trump, pro-Brexit diplomat to succeed Darroch, the Times reported.

This is not the first time the Trump administration has snubbed its allies in Washington.

Last year it quietly downgraded the EU's diplomatic status, for an unexplained reason, from being the equivalent of a full nation state to a lesser rank.

This manifested itself when the EU ambassador, David O'Sullivan, was called on last from a line of more than 150 diplomats to pay respects at former President George H.W. Bush's funeral last December.

The administration also left O'Sullivan out of diplomatic events for weeks. The higher rank was later restored."
Justice Department files to stop Trump suit demanding financial documents,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-files-to-stop-trump-suit-demanding-financial-documents/,"The Justice Department on Monday challenged a federal judge's decision to allow a case accusing President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency to move forward, asking an appeals court to take up the case instead.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright, calling the case dealing with a Revolutionary War-era clause ""extraordinary.""

The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, which would force Trump-related entities such as his New York and D.C. hotels, Trump Tower, the Trump Organization, and Mar-a-Lago Club to turn over business tax returns, receipts and other documents.

Justice lawyers said in the filings that answering their 37 subpoena requests in the interim, by July 29, would cause Trump ""irreparable injury"" and distract him from his official duties.

This is the second time Justice lawyers have petitioned a higher court to take up a case dealing with the emoluments clause, which bans government officials from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress' permission. Last December, the federal appeals court agreed to hear a similar case out of a Maryland federal court that had also reached such a point. In the meantime, a stay on proceedings was also allowed.

The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who is also chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

""Our goal is simple and straightforward — stopping President Trump from putting a 'For Sale' sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office,"" Blumenthal said in a statement Monday. ""Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.""

The Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.

The filing of a writ of mandamus is considered an ""extraordinary remedy,"" according to the Justice Department's website , which ""should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Among the judges who sit on the appeals court, includes chief judge is Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court was not allowed to be heard by Republicans.

The filing seeking for a writ of mandamus comes two weeks after Sullivan ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings. For Justice to succeed at the appeals level, they must meet a demanding standard that would partly rest on showing Sullivan's decisions to be clearly wrong and that there's no adequate alternative for relief in the case.

They have argued that the court has ignored ""unique separation-of-powers concerns"" involved in having members of one branch of government conducting discovery against the president in his official capacity. The government also wrote in their filing that the legislature itself must bring such a case, ""not an amalgam of individual legislators or even a single chamber of a bicameral body.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The District of Columbia case is one of three that argues the president is violating the emoluments clause, but this case is notable because the plaintiffs in this suit — members of Congress — are mentioned in the clause itself. The Democrats' attorneys have argued that Congress not only has a right but is required, as part of their jobs, to weigh in on potential emoluments to Trump such as a $6.5 million condo purchase by the Qatari government or a Chinese-government owned company's investment in a project that will include a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia.

Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the Democrats suing the president are not being injured by him at all but by their colleagues in Congress, who have refused to take up the emoluments issue. And the government has contended that Trump's business activity such as hotel room earnings don't qualify under the constitutional definition of emoluments.

Blumenthal said the subpoenas seeking information in the case are ""targeted"" to get information that ensures the president isn't avoiding his constitutional responsibility to ask Congress to approve any emoluments. The aim of the subpoenas is to trace ownership interests and money flowing to Trump from foreign governments and their representatives.

The subpoenas were seeking the terms governing the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and related information, and aimed to determine trademarks granted to Trump or his companies by foreign governments since Jan. 20, 2017, and all pending applications for foreign trademarks.

The Justice Department asked the court in its filing Monday for a ruling regarding their request for a stay on the subpoenas by July 22 — one week before the official response deadline — ""in order to provide time to seek relief from the Supreme Court if necessary,"" an indication that the governments attorneys may be willing to elevate the case to the highest court if there is any indication they won't succeed at the appeals court."
Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452066-environmental-groups-fight-epas-new-public-records-restrictions,"A coalition of environmental groups pushed back Monday against a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that could restrict access to public records.

The new EPA rule, the details of which were first reported by The Hill, allows the administrator and other political appointees to review all materials requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”

ADVERTISEMENT

The groups that signed the letter, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and many others, have asked Wheeler to withdraw the rule, saying it would be improper to implement it without giving the public a chance to weigh in on its impacts.

EPA’s new rule is similar to the controversial process employed by the Department of the Interior, which also lets political appointees review FOIA requests before they are released to the requester.

Critics of the rule at EPA and Interior have highlighted the potential for abuse.

“Aside from this requirement intuitively granting political staff heightened opportunities to interfere with FOIA requests, it is difficult to see how this change could possibly improve the Agency’s FOIA efficiency or enhance the public’s lawful access to information,” the groups wrote in their Monday letter.

There is already talk in Congress of using legislation to limit the review of public records documents by non-FOIA staff, something the agencies refer to as an “awareness review.”

“Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access,” Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyGraham open to investigating Acosta-Epstein plea deal Taxpayer advocate heading to greener pastures GOP senators decline to criticize Acosta after new Epstein charges MORE (R-Iowa) said in a late June speech on the Senate floor.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”

Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyKatherine Clark quietly eyes leadership ascent Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule UN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty MORE (D-Mass.) is also considering legislation in response to the new rules.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” an EPA spokesman said last month.

In Monday’s letter, the groups contend that holding back documents from a FOIA request is illegal.

“The law is clear that FOIA does not permit agencies to withhold a record or a portion of a record “on the basis of responsiveness,” they wrote.

EPA and Interior have said the FOIA rules are a necessary update to congressional changes to the FOIA law in 2016.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights when the rule was first unveiled in late June. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” the EPA said in a statement when it first announced the rule change."
"Homeland Security requests 1,000 additional troops at border",https://nypost.com,['July'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/08/homeland-security-requests-1000-additional-troops-at-border/,"The Trump administration wants to send 1,000 more troops to the US-Mexico border “to provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support” to Border Patrol agents, officials said Monday.

The Department of Homeland Security made the request last week and is waiting to get approval from the Pentagon, according to an agency spokesperson.

DHS officials are looking to send troops from the Texas National Guard.

“Governor Abbott has consented to the use of the National Guard to support CBP,” said the DoD spokesperson in a statement.

“Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,” the statement added. “These holding facilities house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. These holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.”

The additional 1,000 National Guard members would be a major boost to President Trump’s policing of the US southern border. There were already 6,000 troops in the region as of April — 2,100 of whom were members of the Guard, The Hill reports.

Trump has gotten criticized recently over the conditions at federal detention centers along the border, with Democratic lawmakers calling them terrible and “disgusting.”

The president has denied the accusations.

Department of Justice is reportedly planning to replace in-person interpreters with informative videos at immigration hearings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Lauren Frias'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-officials-replace-human-interpreters-with-videos-at-immigration-hearings-2019-7,"The Department of Justice is planning to replace human interpreters at immigration court hearings with informative videos briefing migrants facing deportation on their rights, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The DOJ introduced the switch to immigration judges across the US last month, calling it a ""cost-saving measure"" for a bogged-down immigration court system, according to The Chronicle. The plan could be implemented as early as mid-July.

The video was proposed as a solution to the issue of ""master calendar"" hearings, where immigration judges meet with dozens of undocumented immigrants in ""rapid succession"" to inform them of their rights and obligations and schedule cases, the number of which is close to reaching one million, according to The Chronicle.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department told INSIDER that there is no specific policy change for using informative videos for ""master calendar"" hearings, which typically only last 10 to 15 minutes. Rather, the shift away from in-person interpreters is ""part of an effort to be good stewards"" of the limited resources of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The video, which would be recorded in multiple languages, would serve a similar purpose: informing immigrants on their rights and the course of the court proceedings. Telephone services will also be used for on-demand translation to migrants, when available.

Some judges and immigration advocates, however, are concerned about the videos.

""It's a disaster in the making,"" one judge told the Chronicle, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have approval to talk publicly. ""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate? You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?""

Los Angeles judge Ashley Tabaddor, who is also union president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told the Chronicle that she believed budget concerns don't justify the shift away from human personnel.

""Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost; it's an integral part of every case,"" Tabaddor said to the Chronicle. ""If they actually look at the [immigration] courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters.""

Jeffrey Chase, a former immigration judge, said to The Chronicle that he believes the lack of human interpreters could discourage trust in the court system. Chase, who now volunteers for organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants, is also concerned about due process for immigrants.

""There's no longer concern about the balance,"" he said. ""It's totally efficiency-heavy these days, and I think it's being decided by people who haven't been in the court much and don't understand the consequences."""
"Pompeo unveils human rights commission, critics suggest it may roll back protections",https://www.cnn.com,['Nicole Gaouette'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/pompeo-unalienable-rights-commission/index.html,"Washington (CNN) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new commission to examine the role of human rights in US foreign policy and which rights should be ""honored,"" raising fears that the Trump administration may be trying to roll back protections for women, LGBTQ groups and minorities.

""What does it mean to say or claim that something is, in fact, a human right,"" Pompeo said at the State Department Monday, as he unveiled the Commission on Unalienable Rights. ""How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim that this or that is a human right, is it true, and therefore, ought it to be honored?"" the top diplomat asked.

""Words like 'rights' can be used for good or evil,"" he added.

Pompeo said the committee will conduct ""one of the most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world since the 1948 Universal Declaration,"" of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations , declaring that ""all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"" and are entitled to a series of rights.

Pompeo argued that the definition of human rights has grown fuzzy, that the concept is now sometimes used to defend ""gross violations"" and that the US has to be ""vigilant that human rights discourse not be corrupted or hijacked or used for dubious or malignant purposes.""

Critics worry commission will 'weaken human rights'

But many see the commission as ""a new body designed to weaken human rights,"" as New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the lead Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, described it on Monday.

Menendez and others question why Pompeo did not include the State Department bureau that focuses on human rights in the creation of the commission or its work, staffing it instead with some high-profile opponents of both LGBTQ rights and abortion, such as his former mentor who he appointed as its head, Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon.

They point to the administration's record on human rights, including President Donald Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia's killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the President's affinity for authoritarian leaders with appalling human rights records, such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

They flag the administration's aggressive push to limit reproductive rights and access to abortion, its silence on LGBTQ abuses abroad and raise the possibility that the secretary is injecting his faith into matters of policy and law. They also question the language being used to describe the re-evaluation of rights.

""This whole thing has been characterized by unusual language,"" said Jeremy Kadden, senior international policy advocate for the Human Rights Campaign.

""This is an attempt to pull back a US human rights vision that we've had for decades and create this new vision that uses these new terms like 'unalienable rights' or 'natural rights' or 'natural law,' "" Kadden said. ""These are all things that have been used by extremist people on the far right, to create a gap between what they consider unalienable rights and alienable rights.""

Blurring the line between church and state?

Like some on Capitol Hill, Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, a US-based nonprofit that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the US and abroad, raised concerns that Pompeo was blurring the line between church and state.

She pointed to an April interview Pompeo did with the Christian Broadcasting Network, in which he said that as a member of Congress, then CIA director and now as secretary of state, ""the task that I have is informed by my understanding of my faith, my belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior ... I think that makes a real difference.""

There is, she said, ""a disturbing pattern of not only undermining human rights of LGBTQ and women and other people who face stigma and discrimination, but also this pattern of inserting Secretary Pompeo's personal faith into the work of the State Department. The undermining of the separation of church and state, and human rights are really hand in hand.""

Serra noted that one right enshrined in the 1948 UN declaration on human rights is the right to request asylum.

""This administration is using rights language for the dubious purpose of denying rights to certain people -- women, LGBTQ and refugees -- look what's happening on the border,"" she said. ""That's a clear violation of the rights of those trying to claim asylum.""

New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the State Department had been very opaque about the creation and purpose of the commission, ""responding vaguely only at the 11th hour. That's why I cosponsored a measure that recently passed the House to prohibit funding for this bizarre effort.""

""The Secretary wants to make an end run around established structures, expertise, and the law to give preference to discriminatory ideologies that would narrow protections for women, including on reproductive rights; for members of the LGBTQI community; and for other minority groups,"" Engel charged.

The State Department did not respond to requests for comment about the criticisms and concerns being raised.

Supporters say Pompeo's move is 'logical'

Others said the concerns were an over-reaction, and that it is a good idea to re-examine what the US considers an important right.

""It's as logical to have a debate about how you rank, order rights as you have a debate about how you rank, order interests,"" said James Carafano, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who drew a comparison to the way the US defense ""constantly"" debates what constitutes a vital US national security interest.

""The reason why you debate those things is that it defines your level of interest; that defines how much resources you're willing to invest,"" Carafano said. ""A government can't do everything, so differentiating between what's truly vital and what's nice to have is important.""

Glendon, the head of the new commission, was a mentor of Pompeo's at Harvard Law School and is known for her opposition to abortion.

She has stirred controversy in the past. A staunch Catholic, in 2002 she criticized the decision to nominate the Boston Globe for a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, saying that ""if fairness & accuracy have anything to do with it, awarding the Pulitzer to the Boston Globe would be like giving the Nobel Peace Prize to Osama bin Laden.""

She also declined an award from Notre Dame University in 2009, because it had asked President Barack Obama to give the commencement address and she disagreed with his support for abortion rights.

Pompeo said members of the commission include Russell Berman, Peter Berkowitz, Paolo Carozza, Hamza Yusuf Hanson, Jacqueline Rivers, Meir Soloveichik, Katrina Lantos Swett, Christopher Tollefsen, and David Tse-Chien Pan."
Trump’s Justice Department lawyers may soon pay a high price for lying to the courts,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-justice-department-lawyers-may-soon-pay-a-high-price-for-lying-to-the-courts-3410348a2ab7/,"Late last month, the Supreme Court determined that the Trump administration lied about its real reason for wanting to add a question to the 2020 census form asking if each respondent is a U.S. citizen.

Less than two weeks later, as a team of lawyers led by the ACLU laid out in a remarkable brief filed in a federal district court, Trump’s Justice Department is entangled in an entirely different web of deceit. The brief, moreover, references a forthcoming motion for sanctions against the government attorneys who litigated this case.

There is a lesson here for officials throughout the government. If you play ball with Donald Trump, you’re likely to get smacked with a fastball right across your temple.

Census Bureau officials warned Secretary Wilbur Ross not to add the question because it was “likely to lead to a 5.1% differential decrease in self-response rates among noncitizen households.” However, as a leading Republican gerrymanderer revealed in files discovered after his death, the question would allow congressional seats to be allocated in a way that “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.”

Rather than disclose its real reason for adding the question to the census form, however, the Trump administration implausibly claimed that it added the question to aid Voting Rights Act enforcement. That rationale, according to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Department of Commerce v. New York, “seems to have been contrived.”

While the New York case was making its way through the courts, the Justice Department repeatedly made another claim that turns out to be false (or, at the very least, that the Trump administration itself now claims to be false). The ACLU brief filed on Friday lists twelve separate occasions where Trump administration lawyers claimed that “the census forms must be finalized for printing by the end of June 2019.”

Because of this claim by Trump’s Justice Department, courts processed this case on an unusually expedited basis. Among other things, the Supreme Court invoked a rarely used procedure that bypassed review by a federal appeals court and allowed the nation’s highest court to review a trial court’s decision directly.

Not long after the Trump administration lost in the Supreme Court, however, it started singing a different tune. Though Justice Department lawyers initially signaled that they were giving up the fight to defend the citizenship question, they were later contradicted by President Trump himself. On July 3, they told a federal judge that they’ve been “instructed to examine whether there is a path forward, consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision, that would allow us to include the citizenship question on the census.”

The problem with this instruction should be obvious, however. July 3 is after the June deadline announced by the Trump administration itself. That means one of three things. Either the Justice Department lied when it claimed that there was a June deadline, or it is lying now, or it didn’t bother to do its due diligence to determine whether its own statements about a June deadline were false.

The primary thrust of the ACLU’s brief is that it invokes a doctrine known as “judicial estoppel” to argue that the Trump administration should be held to its previous claims about a June deadline. “Estoppel” doctrines prevent parties from making one claim, then contradicting themselves when that claim proves disadvantageous.

Yet the brief also makes several references to a forthcoming motion for sanctions. “It is now apparent that Defendants, for tactical advantage, pressed an expedited schedule while engaging in dilatory and obstructionist discovery tactics to conceal damning evidence that the purpose of adding the citizenship question was not to promote voting rights, but to harm Latino communities,” the brief states in its fullest preview of the forthcoming motion. At another point, it notes that if an “ordinary litigant” engaged in the conduct DOJ engaged in here, “sanctions would be the minimum relief provided.”

“Defendants are no ordinary litigants,” the brief continues. “They are agencies of the United States Government represented by the United States Department of Justice. The public interest demands that they act with the utmost integrity and be held to the highest of standards.”

Ultimately, the fate of any sanctions against these lawyers — and of the citizenship question itself — is likely to be decided by Chief Justice John Roberts. Though the conservative Chief rejected one particular Trump administration lie, much of his New York opinion appeared sympathetic to the idea of a citizenship question. There is no guarantee that he will continue to police the Trump administration’s deceit, no matter how grave their falsehoods may be."

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
"DHS asks for 1,000 more National Guard troops at southern border",https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/latino/452054-dhs-asks-for-1000-more-national-guard-troops-at-southern-border,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is asking for 1,000 additional Texas National Guard troops ""to provide supplemental holding and port of entry enforcement support"" to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the state, the Department of Defense told The Hill on Monday.

The Pentagon has not yet approved the request, which was made last week.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has agreed to the use of the National Guard to assist CBP at the border, said Maj. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson.

""Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,"" he said.

""These holding facilities house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. These holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.""

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There were 6,000 troops at the border as of April, 2,100 were members of the National Guard.

The DHS request comes as the Trump administration has received increasing criticism for the treatment of migrants detained at the border.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General recently released two reports detailing conditions in El Paso, Texas, and Rio Grande, Texas, facilities. The government watchdog found severe overcrowding, migrants being held too long and dirty conditions at many of the facilities.

The administration has deflected the criticism, saying stemming the flow of immigrants is a priority.

Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted by 28 percent from May to June, the DHS estimates."
DOJ inspector general: DEA supervisor had improper relationship with confidential source,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-dea-supervisor-had-improper-relationship-with-confidential-source,"The Justice Department’s watchdog revealed that a group supervisor with the Drug Enforcement Administration had an “inappropriate relationship” with a DEA confidential source, used a government vehicle to take the source out on dates, shared nonpublic information with the source, made unjustified payments to them, and lied about it.

The DOJ’s Office of Inspector General, led by Michael Horowitz, released the summary on Monday. The probe concluded that the DEA group supervisor “violated DEA policy” by “repeatedly meeting with the CS alone,” including at the source’s home. The inquiry also found that the group supervisor “went on two personal trips” with the source and let the source visit the group supervisor’s family and friends.

“None of these individuals were made aware that the group supervisor’s companion was a DEA confidential source who was participating in drug trafficking investigations involving violent criminals,” the DOJ inspector general wrote. “In so doing, the group supervisor deceived these individuals and exposed them and their families to potential danger.”

DOJ’s watchdog also concluded that the DEA assistant special agent in charge signed off on improper payments and failed to properly manage the group supervisor.

The report said “criminal prosecution was declined” by the Justice Department.

Horowitz’s investigation into alleged FISA abuse has reportedly concluded, although last-minute witnesses and a tricky classification process mean it may be a while until the report is released."

Department of Justice shakes up team handling 2020 census-related cases,https://www.reuters.com,"['Sarah N. Lynch', 'Min Read']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census/department-of-justice-shifting-2020-census-related-cases-to-new-team-of-lawyers-idUSKCN1U301D,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new team of Civil Division lawyers at the Department of Justice will take over handling 2020 census-related cases, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday, a shake-up that came as President Donald Trump pushes to include a contentious citizenship question in the decennial population survey.

Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not give a reason for the change, but an official at the DOJ said the new team would be a mix of career and political appointees, including lawyers who work in the consumer protection branch.

The department has been looking at ways to add the question after Trump said he wanted it included, despite the Supreme Court on June 27 blocking his first effort to add the question, faulting the administration’s stated reason.

Trump said he was considering issuing an executive order to accomplish his aim. On Friday, the DOJ told Maryland-based U.S. District Judge George Hazel it had not made a final determination on whether to add the question.

The census is used to allot seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and distribute some $800 billion in federal services, including public schools, Medicaid benefits, law enforcement and highway repairs.

Civil rights groups and some states strongly object to the citizenship question proposal, calling it a Republican ploy to scare immigrants into not participating in the census. That would lead to a population undercount in Democratic-leaning areas with high immigrant populations.

They say that officials lied about their motivations for adding the question and that the move would help Trump’s fellow Republicans gain seats in the House and state legislatures when new electoral district boundaries are drawn.

Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), speaking to Fox News Sunday, expressed confidence in Trump’s likelihood of succeeding in getting the question on the census, saying:

“I think the president has expressed determination. He has noted that the Supreme Court didn’t say this can’t be asked. They said that they didn’t appreciate the process by which it came forward the first time, so the president is determined to fix that ...”

The Supreme Court ruled that administration officials had given a “contrived” rationale for including the question. The court ruled that in theory the government can ask about citizenship on the census and left open the possibility that the administration could offer a plausible rationale to add the question.

The administration had originally told the courts the question was needed to better enforce a law that protects the voting rights of racial minorities."
It's time to think more seriously about the implications of elderly presidents,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/its-time-to-think-more-seriously-about-the-implications-of-elderly-presidents,"Should he win reelection and complete his full second term, President Trump will surpass Ronald Reagan as the oldest person to ever hold the office. But Trump's age is hardly ever talked about, because leading Democrats Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be older than Reagan at the start of their presidencies.

As medical science improves and life expectancy increases, more and more candidates may be willing to test the limits of age. And there's nothing in the law that prevents them from running and winning. While one could argue that it should ultimately be up to the voters to decide whether somebody is fit to serve, there are clear issues with this test.

One is that the U.S. Constitution set the minimum age to be president at 35. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential voices in her party, is unable to join the two dozen other candidates seeking the party's nomination. Even if Democratic primary voters wanted to support her, they could not. So if she can't run simply because she's too young, is it stripping Americans of any more of a choice by saying they can not vote for somebody who would be in their 80s during a first term?

The second issue is that even if they wanted to, there's a lack of objective information available for voters to determine whether somebody is physically and mentally unfit to serve out a term in office. Candidates are not required to submit medical information, and both Trump (with his ridiculous doctor's note) and Hillary Clinton (with her pneumonia cover-up) were opaque about their health in 2016.

So, one other solution short of age limits would be to require a more specific set of medical information from candidates for office.

There also may need to be a more specific explanation, with measurable health metrics, of the circumstances under which the 25th Amendment can be invoked. Section 4 of the amendment reads, ""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President."" But that is incredibly open-ended and subject to interpretation.

None of these (age limits, medical disclosure requirements, revisiting the 25th Amendment) might really be a workable solution. But given that it's becoming more common for elderly candidates to run for president, we should be thinking about the problem in a serious matter. Even if a candidate looks vigorous on the campaign trail, a lot can happen within four years in a demanding job, and, in general, somebody in their 80s is going to be at a significantly greater risk of having some sort of adverse physical or mental health decline within that period. This should be a serious part of our political discourse at a time when so many elderly candidates are seeking office."
Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reluctant-witnesses-in-fisa-abuse-probe-agree-to-talk-to-doj-inspector-general,"Key witnesses sought for questioning by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."
Trump shuts out British ambassador for high-level dinner,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Dave Boyer']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/8/kim-darroch-disinvited-treasury-department-dinner-/,"The British ambassador to the U.S. was disinvited to a high-level dinner at the Treasury Department Monday night in honor of the emir of Qatar, as President Trump moved to freeze out the diplomat who wrote unflattering cables about his administration.

The move to pull the invitation for Ambassador Kim Darroch came after Mr. Trump tweeted that his government “will no longer deal with” the diplomat.

Mr. Darroch missed out on a glittering dinner in the ornate “Cash Room” at Treasury, adjacent to the White House, featuring a guest list of Fortune 500 CEOs and international financiers.

At the dinner, Mr. Trump called the Amir a great friend of the U.S. and thanked him for building a U.S. military base there.

“Better your money than ours,” the president joked.

“This is a who’s who of people in business,” Mr. Trump said of the attendees.

Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin hosted the dinner for Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, on the night before the emir meets on Tuesday with Mr. Trump at the White House.

The president said Tuesday’s meeting will be big, “from defense to purchases and trade, and I know everything’s going to be very positive.”

Qatar has been embroiled in a public feud with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, who have accused Doha of backing Islamist militants and Iran.

Among the guests at the dinner were Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg; Trump confidante Thomas Barrack, chairman and CEO of Colony Northstar; Ron Burkle, co-founder of The Yucaipa Companies; Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and a Trump friend; Eli Miller, managing director of Blackstone Group; Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO of Bank of America Corp.; Michael Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Company; David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group; Edward Breen, chair and CEO of DowDuPont; John DeGioia, president of Georgetown University; Raytheon Chairman Tom Kennedy; Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken; Steven Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm Inc.; Lorenzo Simonelli, CEO of General Electric; Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times; Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T; Chevron chairman and CEO Michael Wirth; Christine Lagarde, managing director and chairman of the International Monetary Fund; and World Bank President David Malpass.

Trump's EPA stands up for consumers and freedom by standing up to the ethanol lobby,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/trumps-epa-stands-up-for-consumers-and-freedom-by-standing-up-to-the-ethanol-lobby,"President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency took a step toward draining the swamp by curbing the amount of corn ethanol being forced into our economy by the crony capitalist ethanol mandate.

Big Corn is exploding with shock and dismay, as are corn-friendly lawmakers. But the White House shouldn’t heed the objections of these subsidized corporate moonshiners. Instead, he should lean on Congress to go further and reduce the ethanol mandate to zero.

Ethanol is a fuel alcohol derived from plants, in this country mostly from corn. Without federal support, there would be a very small market for ethanol, which is less powerful than gasoline, typically more expensive, cannot be shipped by pipeline, and tends to corrode engines.

The federal renewable fuel standard, also known as the RFS and the ethanol mandate, is King Corn’s current gravy train. The mandate requires refineries to blend a certain amount of ethanol into their gasoline. The EPA has some leeway on this score, and the agency has used it to protect consumers rather than the ethanol lobby.

The fuel standard requires at least 15 billion gallons of “conventional biofuels,” basically corn ethanol, for 2020. The ethanol lobby wanted the Trump administration to require more ethanol than even the law requires. Trump’s EPA further infuriated the industry by issuing exemptions for small refineries, which often struggle to get their hands on the amounts of ethanol required to meet the mandates.

The corn lobby angrily denounces these exemptions as “small refinery bailouts,” in the words of Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Consider for a moment the perverse sense of entitlement here. An organization representing for-profit businesses, firms engaged in enterprise and supposedly proud of their product, calls it a ""bailout"" when a potential customer is granted limited freedom to not buy their product.

This is how crony capitalism not only distorts the economy and corrupts our politics (watch the Democratic presidential candidates bow before the altar of ethanol in Iowa these days), but how it also corrupts our businesses.

We understand that some of ethanol's biggest champions are powerful. We understand that Trump's political allies include some ethanol hustlers. And we understand the desire to help farmers, especially at a moment when tariffs are unfairly hurting them.

But if Trump cares about the economy, and about draining the swamp, he will not give into King Corn's demands. In fact, he should go in the other direction.

Trump should call on his friends in Congress to kill the ethanol mandate. Pass and sign a law winding the mandate down from its 15 billion gallons down to zero gallons in 2025. At the same time, scrap the mandate for ""advanced"" biofuels. If these fuels are so great, then consumers will buy them without a mandate.

That's how capitalism works, even if the swamp wants it to work differently."

(J. David Ake/AP)

The Justice Department is swapping out the lawyers who had been representing the administration in its legal battle to put a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census, possibly signaling career attorneys’ legal or ethical concerns over the maneuvering ordered by President Trump.

The department announced the move in a statement, which was issued after The Washington Post inquired about whether the career lawyers on the team planned to withdraw. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that at least some of the career attorneys harbored concerns about the administration’s handling of the case — although the nature of those concerns and how widespread they were could not immediately be learned.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity and skill inside and outside the courtroom. The attorney general appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress.”

The shift in lawyers will be reflected in simple withdrawal and appearance notices filed in court, a Justice Department official said. The official said the entire team on the case — both those in political positions and career employees who have served multiple administrations — will be replaced with political and career lawyers from the department’s Civil Division and Consumer Protection Branch. Several career members of the team declined to comment to The Post.

That the department also replaced those in political jobs signals there could have been other factors in the staffing shift beyond concern from career employees. At least one political official, James Burnham, had no objection to continuing on the case but supported the move to go with a new team, according to a Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

The staffing change comes as the department is moving toward what some analysts say is increasingly unsteady legal ground in its bid to add the citizenship question, despite a Supreme Court decision that would seem to bar it from doing so.

[Trump administration scrambles to save citizenship question on census]

Less than a week ago, the Justice and Commerce departments had effectively conceded defeat, saying they were printing the census without the citizenship question and acknowledging even internally that the Supreme Court had given them no other choice. But the surrender infuriated Trump, who ordered the lawyers to do an about-face and come up with ways to keep the fight alive.

Trump said Friday that he was mulling an executive order to get the question added — a move pushed by some of his conservative allies, although legal analysts have said it would be unlikely to succeed in court. The forms for the 2020 Census are still being printed without a citizenship question. Those opposed to adding it fear it would drive down the count of minorities, which is important because census results are used for allocation of funds and congressional redistricting. The Commerce Department referred a reporter seeking comment for this article to the Justice Department.

The Justice Department sits in an atypical position inside a presidential administration, enjoying a measure of independence for its law enforcement operations while also defending the president’s policy agenda when it is challenged in court. Department lawyers can sometimes be put in a position of arguing that particular policies are legal, even if they would not personally support them.

The census case, though, seems to have become something beyond that. Justice Department lawyers had told those suing to block the citizenship question from being added that the 2020 Census would be printed without it, and internally, they thought they had no other options. When Trump tweeted Wednesday that the case was “absolutely moving forward,” some lawyers on it were blindsided.

Appearing that day before a federal judge in Maryland, Justice Department attorney Joshua Gardner explained how he had always “endeavored to be as candid as possible with the Court” but that he did not know what was on Trump’s mind.

“The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the President’s position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and Your Honor,” Gardner said to the judge, a transcript shows. “I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the President has tweeted. But, obviously, as you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.”

The case is not the first instance of a dramatic shake-up among Justice Department lawyers on a high-profile case in the Trump administration. Last year, a senior career Justice Department official resigned in the wake of the administration’s move to stop defending a key provision of the Affordable Care Act.

Although the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the world, even the best need consistent leadership. Fortunately, the Department of Defense (DOD) is receiving a great leader in Esper. He is superbly qualified, by experience and temperament — a family man, combat veteran infantry officer, West Point graduate, defense industry and policy expert, and an intellectual with high-level Pentagon civilian leadership experience.

Esper understands the importance of civilian leadership and how to bring sustainable change in policy, strategy and modernization for the military. However, he does face significant challenges to defend, deter and defeat, if necessary, enemies of the United States — and some of those challenges are at home.

The U.S. focus on counterterrorism not only shifted resources away from modernization of military force planning, structure and technology, it enabled other nation states to challenge, if not close, the competitive edge of the U.S. military. The overemphasis of strategy and resources on Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq (precipitated by an unnecessary invasion of Iraq), and a botched Libya plan enabled America’s adversaries to recognize the changes in the world order. In addition, America’s adversaries took advantage of the divisive state of U.S. politics. Bottom line, America was being outflanked by its competitors.

Chinese alternatives to American values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and a free-market economy are creating a new economic cold war that will face off the United States and its partners and allies against those of China. Through strategic diplomacy, China has extended its influence into Africa and Latin America, while using the People’s Liberation Army as a capitalist tool to strengthen Chinese influence. China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative presents even deeper regional influence across the Middle East and into Europe.

Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinUkraine's new president deserves additional Western support The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes Trump's coarseness, Democrats' shrillness do US foreign policy no favors MORE, meanwhile, aims to return Russia to its legacy where governments must consider Russian perspectives or actions in any region. Russian influence continues to gain in Eastern Europe, where Putin sees NATO as his biggest threat to regional influence. Putin has inserted Russian diplomacy and military power in the Middle East, through Syria and Iran, in order to have a seat at the table. And, surprisingly, Russia returned to the table with the Taliban to counter U.S. influence in this region as well. Most concerning is that Russia and China increasingly are allying themselves diplomatically.

The Middle East could be spiraling toward regional war. Iran, with Russian support, presents the single greatest threat to any region’s stability because of its revolutionary rhetoric, desire for nuclear weapons, hatred of Israel and the historic Shia-Sunni divide. The violence and destruction caused by ISIS, the United States’s haphazard withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, an unprecedented number of refugees, and belligerent rhetoric and actions, particularly involving the Strait of Hormuz, have created a powder keg.

So, what should the new secretary of Defense do?

First, American society needs robust dialogue on what it expects its all-volunteer force (AVF) to do and how big the military should be to protect the United States. The AVF is more professional and experienced in its purpose, but it is not completely positive. A large AVF is costly to taxpayers. Its personnel costs possibly crowded out necessary long-term defense spending on weapons, infrastructure and technology advances. It struggles to compete in a highly competitive labor market, and has created a warrior caste among Americans.

The United States should not take the position that it’s in a state of perpetual conflict, which has been expressed by military and political leaders. This perspective results in overuse of the military as an instrument of government power and stresses the AVF to points of concern for American society.

Second, the U.S. must get out of Afghanistan now. We should have left after destroying most of al Qaeda following 9/11. No one can predict with any certainty of intelligence that another terrorist attack will emanate from Afghanistan; there are plenty of ungoverned spaces and financiers in the world that can make that happen. We should instead put more resources and effort into developing an alliance with India and reinforcing the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Third, modernization and acquisition changes to policy and process must occur faster, while taking acceptable risk in current readiness. DOD must hedge its bets and focus on threats to the survival of the U.S. Constitution and its values, and not every emerging character of conflict in the world. Right now, the U.S. military is doing too much at one time. The United States must invest in high-end technological capabilities such as cyber offense and defense, advanced aircraft, hypersonic weapons, directed energy and 5G telephony to counter future threats. DOD must shed its propensity to make incremental changes if it is going to transform for the future.

Fourth, the U.S. must reinforce European states and NATO to confront emerging threats. The biggest threat emanates mainly from Russian aggression, evidenced by its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, disinformation operations through digital media, and its increased foreign military activity in places such as the Black Sea. NATO, however, faces other threats such as uncontrolled migration, cyber threats and attacks, and Chinese strategic competition.

Fifth, the Indo-Pacific region must remain a strategic priority in order to maintain U.S. regional balance of power because of China’s assertive posture and overall global trade. American isolationist policies are hampering the development and maintenance of U.S. alliances and partnerships in response to China’s rise. U.S. presence and interaction with India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Southeast Asia countries will hedge against China’s economic and military rise and reconstruct the regional order.

As secretary of Defense, Esper clearly will face a difficult set of circumstances for the next few years. He is a great choice — the right leader for the job. His partnership, however, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoThe Hill's Morning Report - House Democrats clash over next steps at border Overnight Defense: Iran exceeds deal's uranium enrichment limit in latest breach | Admiral confirmed as top Navy officer resigning | DHS requests 1,000 more National Guard troops at border Pompeo launches controversial commission to examine 'unalienable rights' MORE, his West Point classmate, must remain a priority. If Pompeo keeps the State Department engaged and in the lead, he will give Esper the best chance to transform and rightsize a more technologically proficient, high-intensity fighting force that is utilized more appropriately in protecting the United States.

The department cannot continue to have temporary leadership when it has the blood and treasure of American fathers and mothers deployed in combat zones. A Senate-confirmed secretary must be present to make the critical decisions presented to our armed forces daily. Congress should step up now and immediately confirm Esper.

TRUMP JOINS EPA HEAD WHEELER TO BOAST OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUCCESSES: President Trump will hold a rare briefing Monday afternoon to underscore his environmental achievements, including a 1% drop in air pollution since the start of the administration.

Trump will be joined by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who will preview a report coming out of the EPA next week showing a significant drop in criteria air pollution, such as harmful air emissions like sulfur dioxide.

He told reporters ahead of the briefing that there has been a 74% decrease in the criteria pollutants since 1970, with a 1% decrease in 2018. The percentage change is meant to show the environmental progress being made under the administration.

But Trump is not expected to discuss greenhouse gas emissions in any great detail. The emissions are blamed as the cause of climate change.

Wheeler told reporters ahead of the briefing that the United States is making great strides on CO2 reductions, highlighting the finalization of the Affordable Clean Energy rule last month, which would replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Environmentalists have criticized the Trump rule for increasing greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging coal use.

In response to a reporter’s question on whether Trump still believes climate change is a “hoax” created by the Chinese, Wheeler said the president’s frustration over climate change stems from a focus on “worst-case” scenarios in last year’s National Climate Assessment.

The Trump EPA chief said that other scenarios, such as the assessment’s medium-case scenarios, do not show such a big hit to the country’s economy if greenhouse gases are allowed to grow in the next few decades.

Wheeler also said that the EPA will be issuing new regulations to cut methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, in the next few weeks.

Wheeler and Trump will boast of other environmental achievements, such as removing the most toxic waste sites in 14 years from a list of polluted areas requiring reclamation.

The discussion will tout the successes of EPA’s water infrastructure program, providing grants to states to make key improvements to pipelines distributing drinking water and removing wastewater.

Trump and Wheeler will also brag about the inclusion of environmental chapters under the trade deal with Mexico and Canada.

Environmental groups began lashing out at the president ahead of the speech.

“The United States' emissions have dropped — and clean energy has continued to grow — in spite of President Trump's policies, certainly not because of them,” said Dan Lashof, U.S. director of the World Resources Institute environmental think tank in Washington.

“Since taking office, President Trump has appointed foxes to guard the environmental henhouse,” Lashof said.

Trump is holding the environmental briefing at the White House at 3:30 p.m.

RENEWABLE FUEL GROUP PUSHES BACK AGAINST TRUMP EPA’S REFINERY POLICY: The National Biodiesel Board launched an ad campaign Monday criticizing the EPA’s use of small refinery exemptions, which free the oil industry from having to blend renewable fuels into the nation’s fuel supply.

""The president's EPA is hurting farmers and eliminating jobs by giving special favors to big oil companies,"" stated the ad that is airing in Washington and Des Moines, Iowa. ""The EPA's big oil bailout is destroying demand for biodiesel.""

Both the ethanol and biodiesel industries make the argument that the oil industry waivers are shrinking the market for the fuels, which the refinery industry firmly opposes as untrue.

President Trump reportedly asked the EPA to review the practice of granting refineries exemptions after hearing from ethanol producers during a recent trip to Iowa, the largest producer of ethanol in the country.

EPA proposes new ethanol standards, and no one is pleased: On Friday, the EPA issued its annual blending requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2020. Both ethanol lobbyists and oil refiners voiced concerns with the requirements.

Emily Skor, the president of Growth Energy, representing large ethanol producers, called the administration’s requirements an outrage. She wants the EPA to restore the lost ethanol from the over two dozen exemptions given to the oil industry, which the proposed RFS does not address.

The 2020 renewable volume obligations “are a drop in the bucket compared to the demand lost due to a flood of refinery exemptions,” Skor said.

The RFS requires that refiners blend billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply.

But the refinery industry also didn’t like the 2020 standard, saying the levels being proposed for next year are too high.

“[S]imply put, these high mandates won’t help American farmers and will just cost drivers more at the pump,” said Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.

EARTHQUAKES ARE CLIMATE CHANGE, TOO?: The anti-fossil-fuel group 350.org is linking the recent spate of earthquakes in California to the oil-drilling practice known as fracking, despite there being no substantial use of the method in the state.

However, there are concerns that the Trump Interior Department wants to open the Golden State to fracking by holding lease sales on federal lands.

The group wants Gov. Gavin Newsom to enact laws to combat what it calls “climate destruction,” including last year’s severe wildfires, which the group links to global warming. It suggests that earthquakes could add to the destruction in the state.

The group stated that scientists have made “fresh connections between fracking and earthquakes, but the greater necessity is for action from California’s administration to limit the climate impacts of future disasters.”

PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS SUE OVER TRUMP’S COAL RULE: Public health groups on Monday became the first to sue against the Environmental Protection Agency’s replacement for Obama-era climate rules for coal-fired power plants.

“In repealing the Clean Power Plan and adopting the [Affordable Clean Energy] rule, EPA abdicates its legal duties and obligations to protect public health under the Clean Air Act, which is why we are challenging these actions,” the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association said in a statement.

The groups argue in the lawsuit that the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA affirmed the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and that it is “simply not lawful” for the agency to use its authority to increase dangerous air pollutants and harm the health of Americans. The recently enacted Affordable Clean Energy rule would allow coal plants to increase emissions.

KAMALA HARRIS RISKS SCORN OF GREENS FOR FAILING TO CRAFT CLIMATE PLAN: Despite having endorsed the Green New Deal, 2020 candidate Kamala Harris risks blunting her rise in the polls after a strong performance in the first Democratic debate if she doesn’t soon propose her own policies to combat climate change, some activists say.

The California senator is surging but has failed to introduce a comprehensive environmental plan as some of her competitors have, including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.

""Given her new prominence in the recent polling, it's time Sen. Harris put forward a clear and ambitious climate plan, or she may risk losing her credibility with party activists, younger voters, and other key cohorts she'll need,” Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with the Progressive Policy Institute, told Josh. Bledsoe noted Harris has not provided her position on several “controversial” topics, including nuclear energy, carbon pricing, and fracking.

Harris, however, was the first candidate to proclaim support for the Green New Deal on the debate stage, deeming climate change a “crisis."" She also scored a memorable moment when she warned Trump’s skepticism of climate change science is a danger to the world .

Harris’ challenge: But candidates such as Harris and Bernie Sanders with clearly defined economic equity and social-justice-driven agendas face challenges about how to incorporate climate change policy.

""The problem we're finding is campaigns are not articulate enough yet on where they stand,” a progressive climate policy advocate who advises campaigns told Josh. “There is also a political calculation of ‘Do I know where I want to be, how does climate fit into my platform, and can I compete with the Jay Inslees of the world, who will always knock it out of the park?’”

Supporters see potential: Supporters boast of Harris' environmental voting record in the Senate and admire her work as California’s attorney general challenging fossil fuel companies.

“She has a strong climate record and has been an environmental justice leader throughout her career,” said Matt McKnight of the League of Conservation Voters, which has given Harris’ voting record in the Senate a score of 100%.

EAST COAST SCRAMBLES TO SHORE UP GAS SUPPLY: The loss of the largest refinery on the East Coast two weeks ago due to an explosion that rocked the Philadelphia area continues to drive fuel prices up as the region is forced to replace lost gasoline supplies, indefinitely, from as far away as India.

U.S. says its producers harmed by some structural steel imports,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel/u-s-producers-harmed-by-some-structural-steel-imports-commerce-department-idUSKCN1U32GV,"FILE PHOTO: A worker walks past rolls of steel wires at a factory in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China July 3, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday said domestic producers were being harmed by imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and that it would instruct the customs agency to collect cash deposits from importers of such steel.

The U.S. Commerce Department said it had found that imports from Canada were not being unfairly subsidized.

Mexico said in a statement that a U.S. countervailing duty investigation of Mexican fabricated structural steel was an “ordinary” anti-dumping probe with no relation to earlier tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Mexico added that its economy ministry would defend the interests of the companies under investigation, and that it had been actively participating in anti-subsidy procedures since early 2019. It did not give further details in the statement.

The preliminary subsidy determination does not endanger ratification of the new North American trade deal, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister for the region, Jesus Seade, said on social network Twitter.That deal was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement that governs more than $1.2 trillion of mutual trade.

The U.S. International Trade Commission said in March that imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico were harming domestic producers.

Fabricated structural steel is used in major building projects, such as bridges, buildings, parking decks and ports. An industry trade group had filed a petition asking for the trade case to be launched.

In 2018, the United States imported $722.5 million worth of fabricated structural steel from Canada, $897.5 million worth from China and $622.4 million worth from Mexico, according to the Commerce Department.

The department is expected to make its final ruling on the imports around Nov. 19."
"Migrant detention presents 'extraordinarily challenging situation,' DHS chief says",https://www.politico.com,['Quint Forgey'],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/07/border-children-detention-mcaleenan-trump-1399372,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan insisted Sunday that the Clint station remains sanitary and is cleaned daily. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo employment & immigration Migrant detention presents 'extraordinarily challenging situation,' DHS chief says

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan defended his department’s treatment of migrants detained at the southern border on Sunday and pushed back against reports of squalid conditions at border patrol facilities including the station in Clint, Texas.

“This is an extraordinarily challenging situation. We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every day. That’s why we were asking for funding for Health and Human Services, to provide adequate bed space so those children could be moved from that immediate border processing into a more appropriate setting for children,” McAleenan told ABC’s “This Week.”

Story Continued Below

“So, I’m not denying that there are challenging situations at the border. I’ve been the one talking about it the most,” he continued. “What I can tell you right now is that there's adequate food, water, and that the reason those children were at Clint station in the first place is so they could have medical consolidated; they had shower facilities — for over a year there’s been showers there. So, this is why we try to provide a better situation for the brief time they’re supposed to spend at the border.”

McAleenan’s remarks came after a report published Saturday by The New York Times and the El Paso Times detailing conditions at the Clint station as “the stuff of nightmares” — including “outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox” among detained migrant children. The report also states that Border Patrol leadership “knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry.”

McAleenan insisted Sunday that the Clint station remains sanitary and is cleaned daily, adding: “I know what our standards are, and I know they're being followed because we have tremendous levels of oversight.” He also dismissed as unsubstantiated allegations of “inadequate food, inadequate water and unclean cells” at the facility, and said that his department has “no evidence that children went hungry.”

Asked about reports that Border Patrol agents have raised alarms about the conditions at the Clint station, McAleenan responded: “Of course we’re worried about it. Everyone in the entire chain of command was worried about the situation for children.”

Later on Sunday, President Donald Trump defended agencies’ handling of migrants, calling The Times’ report part of a “Big Media Con Job!”

“The Fake News Media, in particular the Failing @nytimes, is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the Border Detention Centers,” the president wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. “First of all, people should not be entering our Country illegally, only for us to then have to care for them. We should be allowed to focus on ..... United States Citizens first. Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job.""

“We said there was a Crisis — the Fake News & the Dems said it was ‘manufactured,’” he continued. “Now all agree we were right, but they always knew that. They are crowded (which we.....brought up, not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!”

A DHS inspector general’s report on Tuesday found “dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults” at migrant detention centers, prompting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to call Wednesday for the firing of top Customs and Border Protection officials."
The Justice Department Hasn’t Found a New Reason for the Census Citizenship Question—but Trump Has,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/justice-department-census-citizenship-question-trump.html,"President Donald Trump boards Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Friday. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images

The Department of Justice revealed on Friday that it’s still searching for a new justification for a census citizenship question that might pass legal muster. And while it rummages around for that rationale, the DOJ asked a federal judge to delay discovery into the allegedly discriminatory motives that produced the citizenship question, a request he promptly denied. Meanwhile, Donald Trump revealed his actual reason for wanting a citizenship question on the census—and it contradicts statements his own solicitor general made to the Supreme Court.

Welcome to the ongoing clown show of census 2020.

Friday’s DOJ filing was expected to provide a new reason for the citizenship question, after SCOTUS ruled that its previous rationale was bogus. (Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, said the question was necessary to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, a claim that does not make sense and is contradicted by the record.) Trump ordered administration officials to devise this new pretext just one day after they told a court they had dropped their quest for the citizenship question.

That about-face created difficulties in the ongoing case before U.S. District Judge George Hazel. The Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question because it was illegally supported by pure pretext, not because it was discriminatory. In June, however, plaintiffs uncovered new evidence that seemed to indicate the purpose of the question was to diminish Hispanics’ voting power. In light of these materials, Hazel reopened discovery in the case to let plaintiffs pursue their equal protection claim, a decision affirmed by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Had the Trump administration simply dropped the citizenship question, this case would be moot. But Trump has refused to give up on the question, so this case should, in theory, move forward, with discovery commencing as soon as possible.

On Friday, though, DOJ attorneys asked Hazel to pause discovery while they develop a different justification for the citizenship question. They argued that, by “providing a new rationale,” they will have magically cleansed the question of any discriminatory intent. For support, they cited Trump v. Hawaii, in which the Supreme Court held that any prejudiced motives undergirding Trump’s initial travel ban had been washed away by its third iteration. The DOJ, in other words, believes that Trump v. Hawaii prohibits courts from examining illegal motives behind the original citizenship question once it issues a new rationale for that question.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts.

Hazel did not agree, rejecting the DOJ’s request on Friday in an order allowing discovery to move forward. And for good reason.* It would be much more difficult to engage in animus-laundering here, where the administration’s first justification for the citizenship question has already been shot down. Trump officials are now openly contriving a new rationale, beginning with their conclusion and working backward to find some pretext that SCOTUS might accept. The administration must uproot the entire legal structure upon which the citizenship question stands—unlike in the travel ban case, where the stated purpose (national security) was always the same. Any animus attached to rationale No. 1 will surely taint rationale No. 2 when both are fruit of the same poisonous tree.

It is also pretty shocking to see the DOJ take its time in crafting a new pretext when it repeatedly told the Supreme Court that it had to finalize the census forms by June 30. The administration used this deadline to leapfrog over the court of appeals and get a swift Supreme Court ruling. Now that urgency has vanished, creating the inescapable impression that the DOJ lied to SCOTUS about its alleged timeline in a game of chicken that it unexpectedly lost. (The government is already printing census forms without a citizenship question, so any alteration at this late date will cost a huge sum of money.)

Finally, the Justice Department is not being helped by Trump, who acknowledged on Friday that the “number one” reason for a citizenship question is “for districting.” Presumably, Trump means that he wants to let states draw districts by counting only citizens of voting age, not all persons—a scheme that would dramatically boost white voting power. (It has been neither permitted or prohibited by SCOTUS.) That’s a troubling concession, because Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court that using citizenship data for redistricting was not the purpose of the census citizenship question. Once again, Trump is telling a very different story from the narrative carefully crafted by DOJ attorneys.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion blocking the citizenship question on the first go-round. With every reversal and misrepresentation, the Trump administration is making it more difficult for Roberts to uphold the question under a new rationale. The DOJ will eventually contrive a new pretext that will likely get laughed out of court. It is destroying its own credibility to pursue what has become a feeble and humiliating vanity project for the president.

Update, July 5, 2019, at 3:48 p.m.: This article has been updated to note that Hazel allowed discovery to move forward."

Department of Labor reports trucking employment on the rise,https://www.ccjdigital.com,['Commercial Carrier Journal'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.ccjdigital.com/new-figures-from-labor-department-show-trucking-employment-upswing-in-recent-months/,"CCJ‘s Indicators rounds up the latest reports on trucking business indicators on rates, freight, equipment, the economy and more.

New data released by the Department of Labor on Friday presents a rosier picture of trucking employment through the first half of 2019 than originally indicated by earlier, preliminary data. Instead of a lackluster 400 jobs added since January — compared to the nearly 50,000 between December 2017 and December 2018 — the DOL’s upwardly revised numbers indicate the for-hire trucking industry added 7,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in 2019’s second quarter and 11,700 jobs since the beginning of the year.

According to the DOL’s monthly Employment Situation Report, the second-quarter upswing was capped by a 4,300-job uptick in June. The U.S. economy as a whole added 224,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate climbed a tenth of a percent to 3.7 percent.

Employment in the for-hire trucking industry totaled 1.519 million in June — a gain of 36,800 jobs from the same month last year.

The transportation and warehousing sector as a whole in June added 23,900 jobs, according to the DOL, while major freight producing sectors like manufacturing and construction added 17,000 jobs and 21,000 jobs, respectively."
Justice Department shaking up legal team on census case,https://www.syracuse.com,['The Associated Press'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2019/07/justice-department-shaking-up-legal-team-on-census-case.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is shaking up the legal team fighting for the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census but offered no specifics on why the change was being made.

The change announced Sunday comes days after the department vowed to continue to try to find a legal path forward to include the question on the census. The Trump administration has faced numerous roadblocks to adding the question, including a ruling from the Supreme Court that blocked its inclusion, at least temporarily.

President Donald Trump said last week that he was ""very seriously"" considering an executive order to get the question on the form. The government has already started to print the census questionnaire without the question.

Justice Department presses for census citizenship question The Justice Department says it will press its search for legal grounds to force the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, hours after President Donald Trump said he is ""very seriously"" considering an executive order to get the question on the form.

The Justice Department is expected to file court papers Monday that show a new team of lawyers will take over.

""Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

A department spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether the change had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr.

A Justice Department official told The Associated Press that the new team would consist of both career and politically appointed attorneys. James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department's civil division, would no longer be leading the litigation team, said the official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the court filing.

The Trump administration has argued that the question was being added to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. But Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal members in last month's Supreme Court decision, saying the administration's justification for the question ""seems to have been contrived.""

The U.S. Census Bureau’s own experts have said a citizenship question would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate census that would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well."
