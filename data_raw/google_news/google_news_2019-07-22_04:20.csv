"Trump drops in on New Jersey wedding, as attendees chant 'USA!'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-maga-wedding-attendees-chant-usa,"After a tumultuous and bizarre week in Washington, President Trump unexpectedly dropped in on the wedding of PJ Mongelli and Nicole Marie Mongelli on Saturday night at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, as enthusiastic attendees broke into chants of ""USA.""

Fox News is told the bride and groom are huge fans of the president, had dreamed of him attending their wedding and got engaged at the golf club in 2017. Flags and pro-Trump banners could be seen at the event.

The bride said she'd sent numerous requests to the president in hopes he would attend -- and that Trump ended up paying two visits to separate wedding events. At the first event, he vowed to show up to the second, and kept his word.

As Trump talked with members of the family, a man approached him and shouted, ""I'm the father, I'm the father! Thank you so much!""

""Great job. You did a good job,"" Trump responded.

In videos posted to social media, Secret Service agents were seen keeping most attendees at bay while the bride and groom approached Trump and hugged him.

""Where's the groom? Handsome -- look at his shoulders,"" Trump said. ""Nobody's gonna mess with him.""

“Staten Island is the greatest,"" Trump said, when the groom told him told hundreds of guests from the borough would be attending a party later. ""I love it. I'll see if I can stop by.""

Trump, indeed, did stop by the second event, as the crowd erupted into a ""USA!"" chant.

Meanwhile, a slew of negative comments about Trump's appearance at the wedding appeared on Twitter and other social media platforms Sunday, tinged with bitterness and partisan overtones.

The president has a history of personally reaching out to fans, both inside and outside his properties -- but his wedding drop-ins on his properties are especially well-known.

""If he is on-site for your big day, he will likely stop in & congratulate the happy couple,"" a since-discontinued brochure from the golf club previously advertised. ""He may take some photos with you but we ask you and your guests to be respectful of his time & privacy.""

In March, Trump fulfilled a terminally ill Connecticut man's dying wish with a phone call -- with a little help from the man's sister, an elected Democrat.

Video of the episode showed 44-year-old Jay Barrett, of West Haven, reacting with shock when he realized Trump was on the phone.

""You look good,"" Trump said. ""I wish you could come to a rally. I wish you could come, I know you like that stuff. I wish you could. It sounds like you have a great sister, Jay.""

Trump promised Jay that when he'd have a rally nearby, he'll ""be sitting front row, center.” Trump added, ""I know where you live,"" and said he was very familiar with the area.

Barrett, however, died just days after the call.

"He Wasn’t Seeking to Kill a Mob Boss. He Was Trying to Help Trump, His Lawyer Says.",https://www.nytimes.com,['Ali Watkins'],07-21-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/nyregion/gambino-shooting-anthony-comello-frank-cali.html,"That delusion will be part of a package of evidence that Mr. Gottlieb says he plans to submit to the court that prove Mr. Comello is not guilty by reason of mental defect. Mr. Gottlieb is seeking to have the court place Mr. Comello in psychiatric treatment, rather than prosecute him on murder charges. Mr. Comello is being held in protective custody as he awaits trial.

Prosecutors in the Staten Island district attorney’s office declined to comment.

Mr. Comello took handcuffs with him to Todt Hill on March 13, Mr. Gottlieb said, but his plan was foiled when Mr. Cali refused to submit to a citizen’s arrest. Instead, Mr. Gottlieb said, the Gambino leader reached toward his waistband. Fearing for his life, Mr. Comello shot Mr. Cali 10 times and fled, Mr. Gottlieb said.

QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that originated on internet message boards, played a key role in Mr. Comello’s descent into mental instability, his lawyer said. It claims, among other things, that America is controlled by a “deep state,” that prominent Democratic politicians are pedophiles and that John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a 1999 plane crash, is secretly alive and will run for president in 2020.

At Mr. Comello’s first court appearance in March, he displayed symbols and phrases associated with QAnon scrawled on his hand in pen. He first began to take an interest in political conspiracy theories, Mr. Gottlieb said, in the weeks after Mr. Trump’s 2016 election.

“Mr. Comello’s support for ‘QAnon’ went beyond mere participation in a radical political organization,” Mr. Gottlieb wrote. “It evolved into a delusional obsession.”

Driven by that obsession, Mr. Gottlieb said, Mr. Comello began early this year to attempt citizen’s arrests of people he believed to be associated with the deep state. In February, Mr. Comello twice tried to conduct his own arrest of Mayor Bill de Blasio, including one instance in which he showed up at Gracie Mansion, the mayoral home in Manhattan.

Not long after that incident, Mr. Comello sought the help of United States marshals at Federal District Court in Manhattan, and asked that they help him to arrest two California Democrats, Representatives Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff, both of whom he believed were in the vicinity. He was rebuffed."
Nadler: Substantial evidence President Trump 'guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors' contained in Mueller report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Nick Givas', 'Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Find Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nadler-trump-impeachment-fox-news-sunday,"Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., accused President Trump of committing ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" on ""Fox News Sunday"" this week and said Trump's infractions meet the standard of impeachment.

""The [Mueller] report presents very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and we have to present — or let Mueller present those facts to the American people and then see where we go from there,"" he said.

""Because the administration must be held accountable and no president can be above the law.""

NADLER NOT WORRIES THAT GOP COULD PRESS MUELLER FOR DETAILS ON RUSSIA PROBE: 'LET THEM WASTE THEIR TIME'

Host Chris Wallace asked Nadler what Democrats will do if Mueller's testimony falls flat, and the House Judiciary chairman said he expects the hearing to have an impact on the electorate and plans to ask specific fact-finding questions to help enlighten the public.

""Well, we hope it won’t end up being a dud,"" he replied. ""And we're going to ask specific questions about -- look at page 344, paragraph two, please read it. Does that describe obstruction of justice and did you find that the president did that, for example.""

Nadler also said he isn't worried about Republicans asking probing questions about the investigation's origins via the Steele dossier, and claimed they'd only be wasting their time.

Trump struggles to win over voters reaping economic boom,https://thehill.com,[],07-21-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/453926-trump-struggles-to-win-over-voters-reaping-economic-boom,"The fate of President Trump Donald John TrumpLiz Cheney: 'Send her back' chant 'inappropriate' but not about race, gender Booker: Trump is 'worse than a racist' Top Democrat insists country hasn't moved on from Mueller MORE’s reelection campaign may rest with voters who are benefiting from a decade-long economic recovery that accelerated on his watch, but who disapprove of his conduct in office.

Call them the moral market-watchers — disproportionately male, younger professionals in the suburbs whose portfolios have grown during Trump’s presidency, though they take issue with his behavior.

Those voters represent a vexing challenge for a president who has been more narrowly focused on his base than any of his predecessors in modern history. They are not a part of Trump’s core supporters, and he has shown little interest in persuading skeptics to his side.

Polls consistently show Trump gets stronger marks for his handling of the economy than for his overall job performance. A recent Economist/YouGov survey showed 51 percent of registered voters approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, with 46 percent approving of his job performance. And a CNN survey found 45 percent approved of Trump’s job performance, compared with 52 percent who liked what he’s doing with the economy.

The moral market-watchers who exist within that divide, a new analysis shows, represent a potent pool of swing voters Trump must fight to win over before November 2020.

The analysis of six polls was conducted by Navigator Research, a joint product of the Democratic polling firms Global Strategy Group and GBAO. Those polls found a group of about 6 percent of voters who are conflicted about Trump’s performance in office.

In 2016, about 39 percent of the voters in that group favored Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGeorge Takei: US has hit a new low under Trump Democrats slam Puerto Rico governor over 'shameful' comments, back protesters Matt Gaetz ahead of Mueller hearing: 'We are going to reelect the president' MORE, 32 percent voted for Trump and 29 percent backed a different candidate.

Worryingly for Republicans, and Trump himself, those voters broke for Democratic congressional candidates by 20 percentage points in the 2018 midterm elections.

The voters are a “suburban, affluent type of person who’s probably doing OK but is very troubled by the president’s behavior and everything they see from him all the time,” said Nick Gourevitch, a pollster at Global Strategy Group who helped conduct the analysis. “There are people out there who feel good about the economy but really don’t like the president. Are those people really going to vote to reelect the guy?”

A Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

Party strategists said these voters were critical in handing Democrats the House in 2018 and they will be critical again in 2020, as part of the ongoing political realignment that has once again shaken the two parties’ coalitions.

“There is little doubt that this is the key group of swing voters in 2020, mainly because Democrats are making zero effort to get the other group of swing voters, the blue collar ancestral Democrats who voted for Obama and Trump,” said Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who spent 2018 conducting focus groups with these types of voters.

The moral market-watchers are bullish on an economy that has grown at a fast clip since Trump's inauguration. More than four in five, 81 percent, say the state of the economy is either excellent or good, far higher than the 58 percent of Americans overall who agree. And they trust Trump over congressional Democrats to keep the good times rolling, by a 55-point margin.

In an ordinary election, voter opinions about the economy are a strong gauge of a president’s support. Former President Obama won over 90 percent of voters who thought the economy was excellent or good in 2012. In 2004, former President George W. Bush took 87 percent of the vote among those who thought the economy was excellent or good.

But today, among the moral market-watchers, the economy is less salient. Only a small handful, 17 percent, say Trump’s job performance on the economy will be the most important factor in their vote in 2020.

Trump’s conundrum is the opposite of the one Obama faced as he ran for reelection in 2012. That year, more Americans approved of Obama’s overall job performance than they did of his handling of the economy, according to pre-election polls conducted for The George Washington University, Gallup, NBC and the Wall Street Journal, and CBS and the New York Times.

In a sense, Trump may be a victim of his own success. As the economy improves and more voters feel its positive effects, their focus turns elsewhere.

“A strong economy takes people’s minds off economic conditions and lets them focus on other issues, unlike a collapsing economy which drives attention to just one thing. A good economy helps presidents but it also lets other issues become important motivations for votes,” said Charles Franklin, who directs the Marquette Law School poll in Wisconsin.

Today, just 13 percent of Americans say economic issues are the most important problem facing the country, according to Gallup pollsters — half the number who say that government or poor leadership is the most crucial problem. Around the 2016 election, 40 percent of Americans listed economic issues as their top priority.

When it comes to other issues at the top of the priority list, the moral market-watchers say they trust Democrats to better handle issues like taxes, health care — and even immigration, an issue on which Trump has staked out a hardline position to please core supporters.

That means the economy may be outweighed in the eyes of some voters by other policies and how Trump handles them, suggesting a tough road head for the president as he touts the pace of economic growth under his administration.

“These are the two dominant dynamics of the Trump presidency: the economy and culture, race, temperament,” Gourevitch said."

It’s time to break up DHS.,https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/aoc-dhs-break-up.html,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got at least one thing right this week: The Department of Homeland Security should be abolished.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed breaking up DHS in a radio interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, after which several Republicans began hammering her for the idea. “Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney exclaimed to a reporter. “Moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb,” GOP strategist Karl Rove sputtered on Fox News.

It’s unclear why Dick Cheney’s daughter and George W. Bush’s former White House deputy chief of staff should find AOC’s suggestion so outrageous. A Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, first proposed creating DHS in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to show that his party could get serious about terrorism too—and then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the idea, saying that it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. That proved to be an understatement.

Bush finally relented after the 9/11 Commission concluded that the attacks happened, in part, because the FBI and the CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ movements prior to the attack. This overstated the case, but suddenly consolidation became a popular nostrum to our problems, and in 2002, Bush signed Lieberman’s idea into law.

The organizations that didn’t consolidate—the CIA and FBI, the culprits that mishandled intelligence about al-Qaida in the first place—elevated their counterterrorism units, redirected their focus, and strung new lines of communications between them. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security subsumed 22 agencies from eight federal departments—with a combined budget of $40 billion (back then) and a payroll of 183,000 employees—into one hydra-headed, crossbred, poorly conceived monstrosity.

It wasn’t just the size that was the problem: Most of these agencies had been performing distinct functions; shmooshing them together wouldn’t necessarily make them more cohesive or efficient. In fact, it made each component less effective. Several of those agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who could focus laser-like on their specific domains and had the clout to request direct access to the president. This is no longer true. The Secretary of Homeland Security, even a very good one, has the time and bandwidth to focus on maybe two or three of the department’s 22 areas. The other areas are now handled by undersecretaries or assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries—people with less clout and less access, leaving issues less attended.

The place is a well-known mishmash unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made, and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Here’s one example: In the early 1990s, when the U.S. government started addressing cybersecurity, the Defense Department created a specially staffed joint task force for “computer network defense.” It had bureaucratic clashes with similar but separate units in the Air Force and the National Security Agency, but those in charge were beginning to figure out how to work together.

DHS is unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made—and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Then, after 9/11, it was decided that DHS would be responsible for defending the nation from cyberattacks (though the Pentagon and the NSA would remain in charge of protecting defense networks). The system of interagency arrangements, which had slowly been evolving, fell apart. DHS lacked the resources and know-how for its mission. During the early Obama administration, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the DHS and NSA to work together in crises, but it was sabotaged by a DHS deputy who opposed any plan that helped turn the internet into a “war zone.” (The deputy was a few years late on trying to stop that development.)

DHS has probably also had a deleterious effect on protecting security and civil liberties on the southern border, the main topic of Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns. Before 9/11, border matters were handled by the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Services, which the DHS fused into a new agency, Customs and Border Patrol.

Customs and the INS were run as fairly professional law enforcement agencies, with varying degrees of laxity or fervency, depending on the times. Under a more normal administration, CBP might still operate in that manner. But lassoed into a political department and run by a handpicked operative, it has turned into an enforcement squad for Trump’s obsessively anti-immigrant agenda. Even under Trump’s orders, would the competent bureaucrats of the old Customs Service have herded children into cages? Maybe. But they might have handled things in a more professional fashion because it would have been an independent agency following its own rules and codes, rather than a subset of a super-agency run by a political appointee.

Bureaucratic routines and regulations sometime serve a laudable purpose.

It’s very hard to turn back the clock to 2001 and dissolve DHS into its once separate components, especially since most people don’t remember or even knowthat it wasn’t always this way. But maybe we should try. Republicans talk about dissolving federal agencies all the time. As Ocasio-Cortez put it in a clarifying tweet: “Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.”"

DHS chief to Pelosi: Emergency border funding 'has already had an impact',https://thehill.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/latino/453876-dhs-chief-to-pelosi-emergency-border-funding-has-already-had-an-impact,"Emergency funding has already improved conditions for migrants and agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said this week in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiDemocrats should rise above and unify against Trump's tweets 10 questions for Robert Mueller Ocasio-Cortez tears into Trump's immigration agenda: 'It's about ethnicity and racism' MORE (D-Calif.).

McAleenan described measures the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken in response to reports of mistreatment of migrants, particularly children, at detention centers along the southern border.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The supplemental funding provided by Congress meets immediate acute needs at the border and has already improved conditions for children,"" wrote McAleenan in the letter dated Wednesday but released Friday by DHS.

Late last month, Congress approved a $4.6 billion emergency funding bill to address issues related to the increase in migrants arriving at the U.S. border. That bill opened a rift among House Democratic lawmakers, as progressives panned Pelosi for allowing a vote on the Senate-passed version, which they said lacked appropriate humanitarian safeguards.



McAleenan, who testified Thursday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on conditions at detention centers, also used Wednesday's letter to push back on allegations that DHS agencies like Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Border Patrol are in any way skimping on migrant care.



""No law enforcement agency in the United States is bringing more medical capability to ensure the health and safety of those it encounters or holds in custody than CBP,"" he wrote.

McAleenan requested a meeting with Pelosi to give ""a comprehensive briefing on our efforts to date and our future plans to mitigate the human impact of this crisis to better inform our continued collaboration at this critical time.""

He also attached to the letter a seven-page memo outlining CBP and Border Patrol's standards of care, oversight, family notification and medical care.

The memo highlighted CBP’s 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention and Search, a set of guidelines for detainee care. McAleenan said he helped finalize and implement those standards when he was deputy commissioner of CBP.

In his letter, McAleenan cited the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and the Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA) as guidelines for CBP and Border Patrol humanitarian actions.

""In many cases, it is a combination of the TVPRA and the FSA that established baseline 'requirements for ensuring the provision of water, appropriate nutrition hygiene and sanitation needs,' and 'standards for temporary holding facilities that adhere to the best practices for the care of children' you reference in your letter,"" McAleenan wrote.

The FSA is a court-mandated guideline of care that stemmed from a 1987 class-action lawsuit on treatment of detained minors.

But reports about the level of care led to a tense exchange at Thursday's hearing between Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsCummings: 'No doubt about it' Trump is a racist Cummings asks prosecutors about decision not to charge Trump in hush money probe DHS chief to Pelosi: Emergency border funding 'has already had an impact' MORE (D-Md.) and McAleenan, who said the agency is doing its ""level best"" to cope with the influx of migrants at the border.

""What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on, man. What's that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings,"" Cummings said.

The Trump administration has referred to TVPRA and FSA as ""loopholes,"" arguing they allow for migrants to fraudulently claim asylum in the United States.

The administration's demands to legislatively do away with the TVPRA and FSA have been a key sticking point in attempts at negotiations on immigration reform.

McAleenan wrote in his letter to Pelosi that the TVPRA and FSA have had a negative effect.

""As you know, DHS believes that both the TVPRA and the FSA must be amended to prevent the continued exploitation of unintended loopholes that serve as 'pull factors,' enticing migrants to attempt to enter the country illegally,"" he wrote.

Stephen Miller lets the mask slip,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['James Downie', 'Digital Opinions Editor', 'Opinions Editor', 'July At Pm', 'James Downie Is The Washington Post S Digital Opinions Editor.

Opinions editor

When you’re a politician who has said something indefensible or an ally/staffer appearing on behalf of that politician, dealing with especially tough questions in interviews has a pretty set routine. The first time, you dodge the question and/or attempt a weak defense. If the questioner follows up, you try changing the subject. And if the interviewer still continues to press, you quickly answer the question to move the interview along. What you definitely don’t do is snarl like the killer at the end of a detective show and lay bare your hate.

That’s what you don’t do — unless you’re Stephen Miller. The senior policy adviser to the president made a rare media appearance on “Fox News Sunday” to defend the president’s repeated broadsides against four Democratic congresswomen of color. Those attacks started last weekend with Trump’s racist tweets suggesting that they “go back” to their places of origin. At a Wednesday rally, Trump supporters chanted “send her back” about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), born in Somalia; the president disavowed the slogan the next day before reversing himself a day later and defending the chanters as “patriotic.” And on Sunday morning he launched another volley, tweeting, “I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country.”

Miller’s Republican counterparts on other networks adopted the usual playbook. For example, on CNN, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) first engaged in some rhetorical dancing, including the preposterous claim that “the whole America love-it-or-leave it is not — not a new sentiment. Back in the ’60s, that wasn’t considered racist.” (That would be news to George Wallace, for one.) But pressed on the president’s latest charge, Johnson tersely replied, “I don’t agree with it.”

Back on Fox, host Chris Wallace asked Miller: Why shouldn’t people see the latest attacks and other controversial Trump comments (e.g., “very fine people”) as racism? The White House policy adviser first tried to shift the subject, saying, “I think the term ‘racist,’ Chris, has become a label that is too often deployed by left [and] Democrats in this country simply to try to silence and punish and suppress people they disagree with.” When Wallace persisted in pointing out the basic fact that questioning the first black president’s place of birth “is playing the race card,” Miller shifted to whataboutism, attacking rhetoric from two of the congresswomen, Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)

But Wallace pointed out that “during his 2016 campaign, and even as president, Mr. Trump has been as critical of this country as anything” the congresswomen have said. Pivoting off the mention of Ocasio-Cortez, Wallace asked Miller to defend Trump’s false claim that the New York congresswoman had called “our country and our people ‘garbage.’” (Actually, Ocasio-Cortez was referring to particular policies, not the country.) When Miller obliged, Wallace cited a 2014 tweet from Trump, in which Trump said the United States under Obama was “garbage.” Miller, clearly peeved at being caught in a trap, snapped:

Throughout this interview, Chris, you’re continuing to conflate Donald Trump’s criticisms of President Obama versus AOC’s deep and systemic criticisms of the country itself. And so, let me just cut to the heart of the issue. These four congresswomen detest America as it exists, as it is currently constructed. They want to tear down the structure of our country. They want it to be a socialist, open borders country. If you, as Donald Trump says, want to destroy America with open borders, you cannot say you love your country. If you attack border agents the way that Ocasio-Cortez has, it means you have a deep-seated hatred of the nation as it exists. That’s why you want to erase its borders, fundamentally transform the country and in the process, it doesn’t matter if American citizens lose their jobs, lose their homes, lose their livelihoods, lose their health coverage and lose their very lives.

Miller’s words do more than just undercut his earlier whataboutism and distraction. They lay bare (again) the authoritarianism at the heart of the Trump administration: To disagree with this president is to disagree with America itself. To criticize the country is to tear it down. To suggest America, as “currently constructed,"" is imperfect is to threaten Americans’ “very lives.”

As a political tactic, portraying policy disagreements as disloyalty has long been a staple of U.S. politics. We saw it, for example, during the Iraq War when cynical Republicans liked to imply that any critique of the war was an attack on the troops and the country. But Miller’s formulation, with its conscious inclusion of national identity and subconscious-but-no-less-obvious inclusion of race, is an especially hateful ideology. Sadly, as demonstrated on Wednesday, the president’s most loyal supporters agree with it. It is a chilling vision, and the sooner its adherents are out of power, the better.

Mr. Barr assured supporters of the law that he would back its full implementation. Ahead of his confirmation hearing, he met with senators including Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was one of the bill’s strongest backers. Mr. Barr said that his thinking on criminal justice had evolved, and that he no longer supported the harsh sentencing measures that he had pushed for during his first stint as attorney general in the early 1990s.

During an interview this month after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, S.C., Mr. Barr defended the tough-on-crime measures he had supported at the time as “essential for reducing the crime rate and also tackling the crack epidemic.” But with crime rates down substantially, he said he felt that the time was right to identify and free inmates who no longer constituted a safety risk.

“After someone has been in prison for a substantial period of time, and you can really assess whether they continue to pose a threat to the community,” Mr. Barr said, “then obviously you’re more inclined to modify the sentence or strike the balance in favor of some kind of monitoring that doesn’t involve the heavy cost and the isolation of this kind of prison system.”

The law consists of a package of incentives and new programs designed to improve prison conditions and prepare prisoners considered low risks for recidivism to re-enter society. It also outlawed the shackling of pregnant inmates and the placement of juveniles in solitary confinement and said the Bureau of Prisons must place prisoners close to home if possible.

The law also makes retroactive the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which decreased the relative penalty for possession of crack versus powder cocaine."
DHS warns of Russian efforts to divide America over pineapple pizza -- sort of,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-warns-russian-efforts-divide-america-pineapple-pizza/story?id=64444702,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is warning that Russian agents could seek to further divide Americans by exploiting U.S. passions over whether pineapple belongs on pizza.

It's a cheesy, playful warning -- but it's trying to deliver a serious message. Posted online Wednesday by the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the tongue-in-cheek warning aims to help Americans identify and protect against propaganda campaigns from Russia and other foreign adversaries.

After all, the DHS warning says, Russian agents are capable of simultaneously insisting online that ""Being anti-pineapple is un-American!"" while also pushing out posts saying ""Millennials are ruining pizza!""

""Foreign influencers are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to inflame hot button issues in the United States,"" the new DHS warning says. ""They don’t do this to win arguments; they want to see us divided.""

According to the warning, foreign interference usually follows certain patterns.

First, foreign agents identify a divisive issue to target -- though likely not an issue as silly as whether pineapple is an appropriate pizza topping.

""No matter how you slice it, Americans disagree on the fruit topping,"" the DHS document notes with a pun.

Department of Homeland Security

After targeting a controversial issue, foreign agents then make sure social media accounts are in place, often reusing or renaming accounts ""to pollute those debates with bad information and make our positions more extreme by picking fights, or 'trolling' people online,"" according to the DHS warning.

The ""most extreme version of arguments on both sides of an issue"" often then become framed ""as legitimate information sources,"" pushing them ""into the mainstream"" and carrying them to larger audiences, the DHS warning says.

The final step of foreign interference is for agents to take what started in cyberspace and turn it into something ""very real, with Americans shouting down Americans because of foreign interference,"" DHS warns.

""In the past, Kremlin agents have organized or funded protests to further stoke divisions among Americans. They create event pages and ask followers to come out,"" according to DHS.

DHS offered this example: If the ""war on pineapple"" was a more serious issue, a foreign agent might tell unwitting followers to ""JOIN YOUR FELLOW PIZZA LOVERS AT THE TOWN CENTER TO MARCH FOR PINEAPPLE!""

Nevertheless, in its warning on Wednesday, DHS made clear -- in jest -- that: ""To date, we have no evidence of Russia (or any nation) actively carrying out information operations against pizza toppings.""

Russia's wide-ranging interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, from stealing and releasing thousands of Democratic National Committee emails to waging disinformation campaigns online, has U.S. authorities bracing for what could happen in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

Russian President Vladimir Putin not only wants to ""weaken"" the United States in the years ahead, but he also wants to keep his grip on power, according to Suzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at DHS who helped lead U.S. efforts to mitigate Russian cyber operations.

""He doesn't want [Russian citizens] to see ... the United States and liberal democracy as something they should long for. So what he wants to portray to them is democracy in chaos,"" Spaulding said Friday at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado.

And when it comes to cyber-operations against foreign adversaries, Russia ""is practicing jiu jitsu,"" trying to use the First Amendment and American free speech ""against us,"" Spaulding said.

U.S. State Department says concerned by reports of Chinese interference in South China Sea,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea/us-state-department-says-concerned-by-reports-of-chinese-interference-in-south-china-sea-idUSKCN1UF0EM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it is concerned by reports of China’s interference with oil and gas activities in the South China Sea, including Vietnam’s long-standing exploration and production activities.

“China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states threatens regional energy security and undermines the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market,” the State Department said in a statement.

Vietnam on Friday accused a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and demanded that China remove the ships from Vietnamese waters.

Vietnam and China have for years long been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters in the South China Sea.

On Wednesday, two U.S.-based think tanks reported that Chinese and Vietnamese vessels had engaged in a standoff lasting several weeks near an oil block in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone. Neither Beijing nor Hanoi have directly confirmed or denied the reports.

“The United States firmly opposes coercion and intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims,” the State Department said.

“China should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,” it added.

The State Department also pointed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments earlier this year when he said, “by blocking development in the South China Sea through coercive means, China prevents ASEAN members from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves.”

The State Department also said that China’s growing pressure on ASEAN countries to accept provisions that seek to restrict their right to partner with third party companies or countries further reveal its intent to assert control over oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.

“China’s reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea...including the use of maritime militia to intimidate, coerce, and threaten other nations, undermine the peace and security of the region,” it said."

At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Donald Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death.

The presidents who followed Kennedy accomplished remarkable things in space, including the development of the reusable space shuttle, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and its offspring, the robot exploration of the solar system and the construction of the International Space Station along with Russia and other partners. Yet none of it ever fired the national imagination as did humans traveling to other worlds.

“There was a time when science and space exploration just captured the soul of America,” said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University and author of “American Moonshot,” a new book on Kennedy and the space race. “The problem is it’s easy to say, ‘Let’s go back to the moon and to Mars,’ but as they used to say in NASA — ‘No bucks, no Buck Rogers.’”

Indeed, other presidents never made it the priority Kennedy did, regardless of their sweeping words. “The key factor is they’re not willing to pay for it,” said John M. Logsdon, a prominent space historian and professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “Kennedy not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. None of the presidents since then have been willing to do anything like that.”

Advocates of space exploration hope Trump will succeed with his moon program, called Artemis, for the mythical Apollo’s goddess sister, if for no other reason than his relentlessness when he applies himself to a project or a cause. Being the president who returned humanity to the moon on the way to Mars would be the sort of splashy, high-profile spectacle that excites him.

Trump hosted Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and the family of Neil Armstrong on Friday in the Oval Office to mark what the president called “one of the great achievements ever.” Vice President Mike Pence, who heads a reconstituted National Space Council, plans to visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.

“NASA is back,” Trump boasted.

The hurdles, however, remain sky-high. Pence told NASA in March to accelerate its schedule to reach the moon by 2024, the end of Trump’s second term if he wins reelection. NASA shook up its management to meet that goal. But Congress has shown less interest in financing it, and the technical obstacles to such a timetable remain formidable.

Kranz himself highlighted the challenge in an appearance this week at Purdue University, saying the national environment had changed. “Today, you have this marvelous technology — the books have been written, the kids are educated,” he said. “What we need is leadership that says, ‘Let’s go,’ and then you need unity within the nation that’s going to make it happen.”

Kennedy was “not that interested in space.” He was keen to compete.

Kennedy’s moon mission was born not out of the explorer spirit but a desperation to catch up in a space race the United States was losing. The Soviets had beaten the Americans by launching the first satellite into orbit in 1957 and, just three months after Kennedy’s inauguration in 1961, the first man. In a memo a week later, Kennedy demanded any space initiative that “promises dramatic results in which we could win.”

The answer was the moon. Six weeks after Yuri Gagarin’s orbit, Kennedy addressed Congress to set a goal, “before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” He followed up a year later in a landmark speech at Rice University: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

For Kennedy, it was all about Cold War competition. “I’m not that interested in space,” he told his NASA administrator in a private meeting, where he made clear that space priorities other than a lunar landing meant little to him — as did arriving on the moon second.

Because of an assassin’s bullet, though, it fell to his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson — who unlike Kennedy was genuinely invested in space — to build the moon program into what it would be. While the space project enjoyed only shallow public support given its cost, the assassination made it a moral imperative to fulfill the martyred leader’s vision.

But it would be their mutual rival, Richard M. Nixon, who would preside over the landing on July 20, 1969. Nixon relished making what he called the “most historic phone call ever made from the White House” to speak with Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon. But beyond that, Nixon was not especially engaged in the space program, which was seen as a Kennedy legacy.

In March 1970, less than a year after the first landing, Nixon signed a directive making space just another program that would compete for funding along with every other, the turning point to Logsdon. As interest and television ratings for subsequent Apollo launches dwindled, the final three moon missions were scrapped, ending the program with Apollo 17 in 1972.

Nixon did authorize the development of the space shuttle, the principal path to space for Americans for decades to come, and he sealed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union that would lead to the docking of Apollo and Soyuz capsules in orbit in 1975 under his successor, Gerald R. Ford.

But the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, while momentous geopolitically, also effectively ended the space race. If astronauts and cosmonauts could meet in space, there hardly seemed an urgent need to spend huge amounts of money on an antiquated competition. At its peak, NASA commanded more than 4% of the federal budget; today it receives about half of 1%.

“None of the administrations since Johnson were facing a proposition that what hung in the balance here was nothing less than the beginning of the end of the Cold War,” said Sean O’Keefe, a NASA administrator under George W. Bush. “This was a very dominant theme.”

Story Musgrave, a retired astronaut who flew six shuttle missions, said the original rationale for the space program proved to be its inescapable burden. “The trouble if you make it about winning is that when you win, you may not have” a reason to continue, he said. “Kennedy really did set us up for the total lack of vision that occurred after ’69 because we won.”

Presidential visions are undone by financial realities.

After a six-year hiatus, Americans returned to space in 1981 with the launch of the space shuttle Columbia only three months after Ronald Reagan took office.

Reagan embraced the program as a symbol of American optimism and ambition and, echoing Kennedy, announced to Congress in 1984 that he was directing NASA to build a permanently manned space station “and to do it within a decade.”

But Reagan was most remembered for his moving speech after the Challenger blew up in 1986, killing all seven on board, including teacher Christa McAuliffe. “Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue,” he told a television audience, concluding with a tribute to the crew. “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.”

Hoping to reinvigorate the program, President George H.W. Bush announced on the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11, in 1989, an initiative to return to the moon and then to go to Mars. “Why the moon? Why Mars?” Bush asked. “Because it is humanity’s destiny to strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America’s destiny to lead.”

Logsdon, the historian, who has written several books on presidents and the space program — most recently one on Reagan, published this year — said Bush came the closest any president has come to matching Kennedy’s vision and budget commitment, but the price tag caused sticker shock in Congress, and the idea went nowhere.

When Bill Clinton took office, he revamped the program. “We had concluded that there was little point in putting astronauts on the moon again” unless it was done with a crewed base, recalled John Holdren, his science adviser. But as before, the estimated cost was enormous. “We saw no prospect of such a sum materializing.”

Instead, Clinton cut NASA’s budget and re-imagined the program as a vehicle for international cooperation, converting Reagan’s envisioned space station into a joint venture with Russia as it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union. By the time Clinton left office, Americans and Russians were living together on the International Space Station, and have since.

George W. Bush found himself repeating history. Like Reagan, it fell to him to pick NASA back up after a shuttle disaster when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry in 2003, killing all seven on board. A year later, Bush set in motion plans to retire the aging shuttles in favor of a new set of powerful rockets and a crew capsule.

And like his father, Bush aimed to return to the moon by 2020, followed by a mission to Mars. But even though Congress signed on and financed the start of the program, impatient politicians gave up when progress was slower and costlier than predicted.

Trump sends mixed signals about his moon plan.

Barack Obama seemed less interested in space and killed Bush’s Constellation program to build the Ares rockets and Orion capsule even after it had begun test launches, calling instead for outsourcing manned spaceflight to commercial companies. As a result, since the shuttles were retired in 2011, Americans have had to rely on paid rides to the space station on Russian rockets.

Obama saw no need to return to the moon, proposing instead to land astronauts on an asteroid by 2025 and then send them to Mars in the 2030s. Congressional Republicans scoffed and rejected the idea.

Trump came to office determined to reverse course, re-establishing the National Space Council abolished by Clinton. The president has relished surrounding himself with Apollo-era heroes like Kranz, Aldrin and moonwalker Harrison H. Schmitt.

But Trump seems more enchanted with his plan to create a military Space Force and sends mixed signals about his own exploration program. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that “NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon,” but instead be focusing on Mars.

Even during Friday’s visit with the Apollo 11 crew, he began grilling Jim Bridenstine, his NASA administrator, on why the agency was not simply heading directly to Mars. “We need to learn how to live and work on another world,” Bridenstine explained.

Plenty of space program veterans doubt Trump will succeed. “I don’t think that whoever has opted for this goal has any idea about its cost or practicality,” Holdren said. “Sending humans to Mars would be such a complex and expensive proposition that I don’t believe it will be done at all unless major nations agree to do it together.”

Michael Foale, a retired astronaut who made extended stays on both the Russian space station Mir and the International Space Station, said the 2024 deadline “is highly unlikely to be achieved.” But he said he would “fully support” the idea of returning to the moon for a sustained stay, not just another one-off visit.

“The danger of a Kennedy-Trump-style ‘go to the moon’ — and then leave — is that it will disenchant another two generations of the world population with traveling to the moon even if it is successful, and much worse if an accident occurs,” Foale said.

Still, some past officials see reasons for optimism. “There’s a lot more going for this period of time and this initiative to make this a more possible event than what we’ve seen in the past,” O’Keefe said. “The technology has developed at an absolutely staggering pace that has made this an achievable objective. We know a lot more about what it will take to achieve it.”"
EPA rejects challenge of pesticide linked to brain damage,https://www.koaa.com,[],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.koaa.com/news/national-world-news/epa-rejects-challenge-of-pesticide-linked-to-brain-damage,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency rejected a key legal challenge Thursday to a pesticide linked to brain damage in children, saying environmental groups had failed to prove that a ban was warranted.

The agency’s defense of continued use of the widely used bug-killer chlorpyrifos could set the stage for a pivotal federal court decision on whether to overrule the EPA and force the agency to ban it.

“To me, this starts the clock on the use of chlorpyrifos on food crops in the US,” said former senior EPA attorney Kevin Minoli.

Scientists say studies have shown that chlorpyrifos damages the brains of fetuses and children. The pesticide has been used nationally on dozens of food crops, but California — the nation’s largest agricultural state — and a handful of other states have recently moved to ban it.

The agency said the environmental groups had failed to prove that the pesticide wasn’t safe.

Last summer, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to ban all sales of the pesticide. The court decided to reconsider that ruling with a slate of 11 judges, who gave the EPA until this month to respond to the environmental groups’ arguments for banning chlorpyrifos.

The EPA under the Obama administration had initiated a ban, but the agency reversed that decision shortly after President Donald Trump took office.

The EPA defense Thursday showed that “as long as the Trump administration is in charge, this EPA will favor the interests of the chemical lobby over children’s safety,” said Ken Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group environmental advocacy organization.

In a statement, the EPA said it was separately speeding up a regular agency review of the pesticide’s continued use, and expected a decision on that well ahead of a 2022 deadline.

The EPA said it also was talking with chlorpyrifos makers about further restrictions on how farmers use the pesticide.

Ocasio-Cortez confronted Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan about images of her ""violent rape"" from a secret Facebook group. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

Ellucian Banner security flaw highlighted by Education Department,https://www.insidehighered.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/19/ellucian-banner-security-flaw-highlighted-education-department,"The U.S. Department of Education has warned of “active and ongoing exploitation” of a security flaw in Ellucian’s Banner system that may have given hackers access to student data such as grades, financial information and Social Security numbers.

A security alert, published Wednesday by the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, said 62 colleges and universities using Banner had already been targeted. The alert indicates that criminals have been “scanning the internet looking for institutions to victimize” and drawing up lists of colleges to target.

Institutions that have transitioned to Banner 9, the latest version of Ellucian’s enterprise resource planning system, are not thought to be affected. But users using older versions of two Banner modules called Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services could be vulnerable.

According to Ellucian’s website, more than 1,400 institutions worldwide use Banner to manage student grades, staff payrolls, course schedules, admissions and student financial aid, among other tasks. Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services can be used by system administrators to get access to sensitive data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The student aid office encouraged institutions that have not recently upgraded Web Tailor or Enterprise Identity Services to do so and to contact the FSA incident team to determine whether there has been a data breach. Ellucian published a patch on May 14 that fixed the security flaw but has not shared how many institutions have installed it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology described the Banner security flaw as an “improper authentication vulnerability” that enabled attackers to take over users' sessions when they attempted to log in. Depending on the administrative privileges of the user, and the way data are organized by individual institutions, attackers could use this access to move laterally through administrative systems and access sensitive information. Attackers could also potentially manipulate this information, perhaps changing personal information or grades, dropping students from their courses or denying them student financial aid.

According to FSA, affected institutions reported that attackers used the security flaw to manipulate admissions and enrollment systems and create thousands of fake student accounts over the space of a few days. “Some of these accounts appear to be leveraged almost immediately for criminal activity,” the office said.

Josh Sosnin, chief information security officer at Ellucian, said in an emailed statement that there is no connection between the security flaw and the generation of the fake student accounts. “Ellucian has confirmed internally that the two issues outlined in the Department of Education report are separate, unrelated issues,” he said. “There is no connection between these two issues and Ellucian has communicated this to the Department of Education.”

If your campus uses Banner/Ellucian as a SIS, I hope you install updates in a timely manner. So far 62 campuses have reported they were affected by exploitation of a vulnerability in the product by ""criminal elements."" Patch was released May 14. #emchat https://t.co/SwIkZvdZaN — Dr. Liz Gross (@lizgross144) July 18, 2019

Institutions being targeted by bots that submit fraudulent admissions applications are “an industry issue and not specific to Ellucian or Banner,” said Sosnin. He added that Ellucian’s customer service employees are “standing by to help” customers with questions about patches or updates.

Why the FSA office is reporting on the Banner security flaw two months after it was patched by Ellucian is unclear. It is also not clear how the flaw was discovered, though the NIST advisory links to a document suggesting that it may have been identified as early as December 2018 by Joshua Mulliken, a member of IT staff at the University of South Carolina.

In a GitHub post, Mulliken outlines a “disclosure timeline” indicating that Ellucian took several months to address his concerns. Mulliken said via email that he was the first person to identify the security flaw.

""Ellucian has not been proactive in ensuring that its customers understand the seriousness of CVE-2019-8978,"" said Mulliken. ""Several institutions have reached out to me today and informed me that the had deferred updating for some time. The official messaging was not able to convey the urgency required, which more than likely contributed to the current situation.""

Scott Shackelford, professor of law and cybersecurity program chair at Indiana University at Bloomington, said it is not uncommon for organizations to take several months to release patches addressing security issues, particularly if they “don’t think it’s particularly troublesome.”

Moving forward, Shackelford encouraged colleges and universities to pay attention when companies release updates and install them “as quickly as possible.”

“This really boils down to basic cyberhygiene,” he said. He encouraged institutions to limit the number of users with administrative privileges for Banner and other enterprise resource planning software.

Both Shackelford and Emory Roane, privacy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that tracks data breach disclosures and advocates for consumer data protection, said it could take weeks before more information about the data breach is made public.

Depending on where institutions are located and what type of data were affected, there are different reporting requirements for disclosing breaches, said Shackelford. In Georgia, for example, there is no state-enforced timeline for reporting data breaches, he said. Roane would like to see that change -- he thinks the U.S. should move closer to Europe’s 72-hour disclosure requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Without disclosures, it is difficult to determine how serious the Banner data breaches are, said Shackelford.

Charlie Moran, senior partner and CEO of Moran Technology Consulting, described the breach as “bad, but only for a small number of schools.”

Most of the 1,400 institutions using Banner have already made the transition to Banner 9 modules, said Moran. “Most schools moved to Banner 9 this past year in a forced march because of a major software change that Ellucian was forced to make, so there are not a lot of schools running this old software,” he said."
"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."
Trump and State Department's Intervention Could Reportedly Hurt ASAP Rocky's Chances of Release,https://www.yahoo.com,['Gavin Evans'],07-21-2019,2019,7,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-state-department-apos-intervention-173358816.html,"""Sources connected to the case"" have reportedly told TMZ that the intervention by the U.S. State Department and President Trump could actually end up backfiring in their ongoing effort to try and get ASAP Rocky released from a Swedish jail. While TMZ is unclear on specifics, the previously mentioned sources think that there could be acrimony from Swedish prosecutors who would be angry about attempted interference into their affairs. They also may not want to look like they're easing up due to U.S. intervention.

On Friday, prosecutor Daniel Suneson requested (and was granted) a six-day extension to continue with an investigation into assault allegations against Rocky. That investigation is now set to run through Thursday, July 25. At that point, another hearing is set to see if ASAP should be further detained. As for Rocky's side of things, he has maintained throughout the entire ordeal that he acted in self-defense.

On Saturday, Trump was told by Swedish prime minister Stefan Lofven that the Swedish government would not intervene in the investigation, according to a statement. Trump had sought the rapper's release after being asked to do so by A-listers that included Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. The call between Trump and Lofven reportedly lasted about 20 minutes, and was said to be “friendly and respectful.”

Despite the cordial vibe, however, Lofven reportedly ""underlined that in Sweden everyone is equal before the law and that the government cannot and will not attempt to influence the legal proceedings."" The call was apparently not the end of the dialogue on the subject between the two governments, as Trump said on Twitter: ""Our teams will be talking further, and we agreed to speak again in the next 48 hours."""
Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as weapons of mass destruction.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."

Et July']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/18/justice-department-weighed-rule-not-charging-president-ending-trump-hush-money-case/1769339001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors' decision to end an investigation into hush money payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump relied at least in part on long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The Justice Department told a federal judge on Monday that it had ""effectively concluded"" its investigation into efforts to silence the women in the final months of the 2016 campaign, but did not explain why it had done so. Prosecutors have said the payoffs violated a federal law that restricts campaign donations.

A person familiar with the case, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said it was unclear whether prosecutors made a determination that they had sufficient evidence to bring a case against Trump or anyone other than his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year. But the Justice Department's opinion that a president cannot be indicted factored into the decision to end the probe, the person said.

Federal prosecutors had repeatedly placed Trump at the center of the effort to silence pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the chaotic run-up to the 2016 election. Last year, they alleged in a court filing that Cohen had orchestrated illegal hush-money payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. And it revealed in unsealed court records on Friday that Trump participated in phone calls about the payments to Daniels.

The judgment by federal prosecutors in New York to take no further action in the wide-ranging inquiry tracks a decision earlier this year by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who cited the same Justice Department policy when he declined to make a determination about whether Trump's efforts to derail that investigation amounted to a crime.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2000 that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution."" That view has never been tested in court but is binding on federal prosecutors.

As in the Mueller inquiry, which outlined 10 instances in which Trump sought to thwart the special counsel's inquiry, documents revealed Thursday put then-candidate Trump in middle of a frantic effort to fend off damaging disclosures about his personal conduct just a month before the 2016 election.

In the documents, the FBI described a series of conversations in the days after a leaked Access Hollywood outtake showed Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals about preventing Daniels from airing her own claims of having had an affair with Trump years earlier.

Authorities laid out a timeline of emails, text messages and phone calls – some involving Trump himself – that ""concerned the need to prevent"" Daniels from going public with her story.

Trump denied knowledge of the payments after they became public. But the FBI told a judge it had obtained telephone records showing he participated in some of the first conversations about the scheme, which prosecutors have said violated federal campaign finance laws.

Federal prosecutors said in court filings last year that Cohen orchestrated payments to Daniels and McDougal, ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. The documents unsealed Thursday offer the first clear account of the extent of Trump's involvement in that effort, as the Republican nominee's campaign floundered just weeks before the election.

Ultimately, it was Cohen – not Trump – who was charged and convicted for the scheme. He is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison related to tax evasion and the hush-money scheme that amounted to illegal campaign finance violations. He also pleaded guilty to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

""Cohen's commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,"" prosecutors asserted prior to Cohen's sentencing.

In the same document, however, prosecutors indicated that Cohen was acting on behalf of Trump who they then-described in gauzy law enforcement vernacular as ""Individual 1.""

""The investigation is over,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Thursday. He declined to address whether the current Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president blocked any further action contemplated by New York prosecutors.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

But from a federal prison in upstate New York, Cohen continued to claim that his conviction should not mark the end of an investigation that has long shadowed the White House.

""I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment,” Cohen said in a statement Thursday. “The conclusion of the investigation exonerating The Trump Organization's role should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and the Department of Justice.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the unsealed documents bolstered Cohen's assertions.

""The inescapable conclusion from all of the public materials available now is that there was ample evidence to charge Donald Trump with the same criminal election law violations for which Michael Cohen pled guilty,"" Schiff said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has failed to bring 'swagger' back to the State Department and America is paying the price,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Brett Bruen'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-hasnt-restored-state-department-opinion-2019-7,"He came in promising to restore some swagger to the step of America's diplomats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spent a lot of time on swagger, his own. Little effort has been made to lift up others.

Our country's first line of defense at outposts around the world remains dangerously diminished and damaged. Even more concerning for our national security, such arrogance and ambition have proven quite costly for our influence abroad.

When Pompeo came on board, replacing the former Texas oil executive Rex Tillerson, the State Department was still suffering from a condition I call: Post-Tillerson Stress Disorder.

The Texas oil executive's management reforms wreaked havoc through the halls of the Harry S. Truman Building. So even though Pompeo was a former congressman from the outer extremities of the political spectrum, he was still seen as an improvement.

Pompeo promised to lift the debilitating hiring freeze and look after his people. A new ""professional ethos"" was written up, emphasizing respect and integrity. Unlike his predecessor, Pompeo spent time with families when he visited embassies. Just the fact that he held meetings and traveled regularly was an improvement.

Sure, his constant talk about swagger seemed a bit silly at first. But, my former colleagues told me, ""At least he will put us back at the big-kids table."" Many believed his promises of renewed hiring, reversing deep cuts to programs, and providing some modicum of support for those who serve.

The hiring hasn't gotten back to prior levels. Budgets continue to be slashed. Worst of all, Foreign Service families aren't getting the help they desperately need.

The State Department has not provided ongoing care for those injured by the serious sonic attacks in Cuba and China. Pompeo has also callously chosen not to restore funding for the care required for children of diplomats with special needs.

Then came the shutdown. That was the moment he really lost support, according numerous current diplomats with whom I remain in contact. They were so outraged we organized a call with journalists to shed light on their predicament, an unprecedented move for the normally press-shy diplomatic corps.

Americans serving overseas with their families bore some of the worst impacts from the extended period without pay. Unlike federal workers in the US, diplomats posted abroad could not pick up gigs on the local market. They don't have a support network of friends and family nearby. They wanted to hear their secretary at least acknowledge their predicament.

Instead, Pompeo ignored their plight. Making matters worse, he chose to bring his wife on a several-nation trip at the height of the shutdown. He even asked American diplomats working without pay to staff his wife, possibly in violation of federal regulations.

My former colleagues told me they were absolutely livid. It was an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on those serving abroad.

Then come the policy problems. Pompeo has by most measures mismanaged the North Korea account, failing to win Pyongyang's trust and teeing up solutions for three presidential-level engagements. The coalition to support a tougher stand on Iran has failed to materialize. Pompeo's aggressive saber-rattling on Venezuela was unhelpful.

Without question, selling Trump's policies can be a tall order. But his predecessors Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice managed to apply some delicate diplomacy to navigate turbulent waters in the wake of former President George W. Bush's deeply unpopular decisions, from Guantanamo to Iraq. This balancing act seems to be absent from Pompeo's State Department.

It's easy to dismiss the bombastic Pompeo as a natural byproduct of the Trump era. But bear in mind he is now what passes for a brake on bad ideas in the cabinet. He is literally what stands between us and another unwise war.

The trouble with swagger is that it soon wears off. It also really wears on people, when not grounded in substance.

America is paying a high price for the pompousness of Pompeo. Many foreign leaders have just stopped listening to him. Turkey's recent acquisition of a Russian missile system is just the latest example.

From what I hear, a good portion of his own department has lost confidence in his leadership. Career employees continue to flee, including a more than 30% decline in the percentage of senior Foreign Service executives who are African American, according to a recent report.

Lastly, despite all the bravado, the secretary has yet to deliver a single major foreign-policy victory for the administration. I think it's beyond time to dial back on the arrogance. He would be well served to channel President Teddy Roosevelt's advice of speaking softly while carrying a big stick.

Brett Bruen was the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat. He now runs the crisis-communications agency the Global Situation Room and teaches crisis management at Georgetown."
Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions?source=politics&via=rss,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"
Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers,https://thehill.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453893-science-committee-chair-threatens-epa-over-stonewalled-answers-to,"Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson Eddie Bernice JohnsonOvernight Energy: Historic heat wave is double whammy for climate change | Trump sees 'bigger problems' than plastic straws | House Science chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers Democrats, scientists slam Trump administration actions on scientific boards MORE (D-Texas), the chairwoman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said she is “deeply troubled” by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) lack of cooperation with lawmakers in a letter sent Thursday to EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Historic heat wave is double whammy for climate change | Trump sees 'bigger problems' than plastic straws | House Science chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers Overnight Energy: USDA expected to lose two-thirds of research staff in move west | EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution | Agency eyes reducing inspections of nuclear reactors MORE.

Johnson said the EPA's failure to provide requested information to her committee represented an “obstruction of Congress,” and she threatened “compulsory measures” if it does not provide previously requested information by July and August deadlines.

“Over the past five months, EPA has stonewalled this Committee — preventing a coequal branch of government from conducting constitutionally-mandated oversight,"" Johnson wrote.

“I am deeply troubled by this lack of cooperation with our efforts to evaluate a program so vital to ensuring the health and safety of the American people, and this behavior fits into a disturbing pattern of obstruction and disrespect of Congressional authority.”

The EPA in a statement said the letter included a number of ""inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations."" It also said it had made efforts to send officials to the committee to answer its questions.

“The Committee’s letter includes a number of inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations, including that of the Agency’s interaction with the Committee and Committee staff,"" the statement from EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

""The Agency previously worked with the Committee to provide our top career science official within the Office of Research and Development to testify on the IRIS program.""

The IRIS program is the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, which is at the center of the panel's fight with the agency.

Lawmakers have put the chemical program under a microscope following reports that the agency suppressed a 2017 report outlining the health risks associated with formaldehyde. The program within the EPA is responsible for conducting many chemical risk assessment reports. These reports often underpin federal health protections.

Johnson’s committee has been pressing the EPA to explain why in December 2018 it removed formaldehyde and nine other chemical assessments from its program outlook.

“The agency has rebuffed the committee’s attempts to understand the prioritization process and how the benefits of eliminating several late-stage chemical assessments, including formaldehyde, outweigh the benefits,” Johnson wrote.

Johnson listed four instances where letters had been written to the EPA with questions or requests for briefings with agency officials, to little or no response.

She also cited the committee’s March 27 hearing on IRIS, where Kristina Thayer, the head of the program, was requested to testify. EPA instead sent another employee, Dr. Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who Johnson said was not involved in certain decisions the committee was keen to learn more about.

“At the hearing it became clear that Dr. Orme-Zavaleta was not involved in many of the decisions at the core of the committee’s investigation of the program, and she was not prepared by the agency to answer basic questions about relevant events about the past year,” Johnson wrote.

Abboud said Orme-Zavaleta was the EPA's science adviser and principal deputy assistant administrator, and ""was capable of adequately informing the Committee on the IRIS program and did so for as long as the Committee members had questions during the Committee’s March 27th hearing on the IRIS program.""

He accused panel members of mischaracterizing statements Orme-Zavaleta made in her testimony.

""As for the Committee’s repeated complaints this week about the Agency’s decision on who to provide on behalf of the EPA to testify, it is disappointing that the Committee refuses to acknowledge the extensive qualifications of Dr. Orme-Zavaleta and her ability to speak knowledgeably on all issues within her office and that the Committee continues to insist on dictating to the Agency who they believed is qualified to speak on issues, rather than agreeing to work with the Agency,"" Abboud said.

He added that Wheeler had agreed to testify in front of the committee on Sept. 19.

Johnson in her letter said EPA’s continued attempts to obfuscate details related to the IRIS program amounts to an “obstruction of Congress.”

She said the panel wanted by the end of the business day Friday one specific document related to IRIS.

“Your staff in congressional affairs has made every effort to obstruct the committee’s oversight, going so far as to attempt to change the substance of the record. At this point, the committee has exhausted all non-compulsory means of conducting oversight over EPA. The agency’s obstruction of Congress is particularly disturbing considering the implications of the matter at hand for children’s health,” she wrote."

Fed's jumbled messaging catches Trump's attention ahead of key policy-setting meeting,https://finance.yahoo.com,['Brian Cheung'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-john-williams-james-bullard-trump-104905847.html,"The Federal Reserve has had a rough two days of communicating its policy to the public, risking confusing market participants ahead of a critical July 31 meeting where the central bank could deliver the first interest rate cut in over 10 years.

On Thursday, New York Fed President John Williams had markets dancing after he made remarks comparing easing monetary policy to getting a vaccination, saying it “pays to act quickly to lower rates at the first sign of economic distress.” His remarks were focused on how monetary policy decisions are different when interest rates are close to zero (the Federal funds rate is currently in a target range of 2.25% to 2.5%).

“It’s better to take preventative measures than to wait for disaster to unfold,” Williams said.

Investors interpreted his remarks as signaling a more dramatic interest rate cut in the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 31. Bets on a 50 basis point rate cut surged in Fed funds futures markets, and the New York Fed followed up with an unusual clarification on Williams’s speech.

“This was an academic speech on 20 years of research,” a New York Fed spokesperson said in a statement sent to reporters. “It was not about potential policy actions at the upcoming FOMC meeting.”

On Friday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (a voting member of this year’s FOMC) said he was sitting front row at that speech and sided with the clarification.

“My interpretation was that he was talking about his past research,” Bullard said.

Starting Saturday the Federal Reserve’s policymakers will stop making public remarks ahead of the July 31 meeting, as part of the normal “blackout” protocol that precedes FOMC meetings.

Misread or misspeak?

After Williams’s remarks, Fed funds futures contracts raised the odds of a 50 basis point rate cut to about 60%, with a 40% chance of a 25 basis point cut. Williams’s remarks came alongside commentary from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida saying that the Fed doesn’t “have to wait until things get so bad to have a dramatic series of rate cuts.”

When the New York Fed issued its clarification, the odds of a 50 basis point cut came back down to 22.5%.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch described the Fedspeak as a “head fake.”

“In other words, Williams unintentionally misguided the markets,” Bank of America’s Michelle Meyer wrote. “We believe the NY Fed had no other choice but to issue a press release given that the Fed’s blackout period starts on July 20th.”

But the comments caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who said Williams’s remarks were “100% correct in that the Fed ‘raised’ far too fast & too early.”

I like New York Fed President John Williams first statement much better than his second. His first statement is 100% correct in that the Fed “raised” far too fast & too early. Also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening. We are in a World competition, & winning big,... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019

....but it is no thanks to the Federal Reserve. Had they not acted so fast and “so much,” we would be doing even better than we are doing right now. This is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the U.S., GROWTH, which would greatly reduce % debt. Don’t blow it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2019

The New York Fed declined to comment on the president’s tweets.

Ken Matheny, an executive director and Fed watcher at Macroeconomic Advisers, told Yahoo Finance that Trump’s paraphrasing was a “complete misread” of what Williams was trying to say. Williams’s remarks reflected on his research on reacting to “adverse” economic developments with rates close to zero.

With stronger data coming in since the June meeting, the Fed doesn’t appear to be getting “adverse” readings on the economy."
Oakland’s lawyers believe DOJ got involved in suit against NFL for political reasons,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com,['Posted Mike Florio'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/19/oaklands-lawyers-believe-doj-got-involved-in-suit-against-nfl-for-political-reasons/,"Getty Images

The Trump administration is possibly trying to help the NFL. Or, possibly, it’s trying to hurt Oakland.

Daniel Kaplan of TheAthletic.com reports that there’s a belief within the city’s legal team that the Department of Justice has butted in to the antitrust lawsuit challenging the relocation of the Raiders as retaliation against Oakland for Major Libby Schaaf’s criticism of President Trump.

“Oakland is not this particular administration or this president’s favorite city,” an unnamed source close to the city’s legal team told Kaplan. “And the mayor has been outspoken in her criticism of the current administration. But [it] wouldn’t surprise me that that was a factor.”

The DOJ filed a “statement of interest” arguing that Oakland can’t recover lost tax revenues and lease revenues through the antitrust lawsuit. If accepted, the argument wouldn’t kill the case, but it would limit the potential recovery.

“The reason why it’s kind of bizarre is that this little argument they make is really not particularly substantive; it doesn’t get rid of the case,” the unnamed source tells Kaplan. “So you wonder why, other than for political reasons, why would they file something that’s so totally stupid?”

I’m personally more inclined to think — and this is speculation, but when has that ever stopped me? — that it’s not an attack on Oakland but a favor to the NFL, which would further confirm the notion (partly speculation, partly informed) that something significant has happened behind the scenes to dramatically reverse the relationship of antagonism that existed between the President and the NFL.

From complaints about the concussion rules to taking credit for the league’s dramatic dip in ratings to a profane attack at an Alabama rally against players who protest during the playing of the national anthem to relentless criticism of the league’s handling of its anthem policy, President Trump was a major thorn in the league’s side until he suddenly wasn’t, dropping a low-hanging red-meat issue that would have been very easy to keep raising through the mid-term elections, and beyond.

So, yes, something happened. Maybe it was as simple as the public “thank you” from Commissioner Roger Goodell to the President regarding a fairly obscure business issue in Canada."
Tom Cotton helps Eugene Scalia land appointment as Secretary of Labor,https://arktimes.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2019/07/19/tom-cotton-helps-eugene-scalia-land-appointment-as-secretary-of-labor,"Noted Trump-whisperer Sen. Tom Cotton was among those who helped grease the wheels for Eugene Scalia to land the appointment as the next secretary of labor, according to a report in the New York Times:

Two people familiar with his appointment said several conservatives had suggested Mr. Scalia to the president in recent days. Among them was Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who waited to suggest it until Mr. Acosta had agreed to step down, according to one person familiar with the discussions. After discussing the idea with several senior Trump officials, Mr. Cotton spoke to the president and then joined a meeting Thursday afternoon during which the president offered Mr. Scalia the job.

Scalia, the son of former Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, is a Federalist Society ideologue who has built his legal career advocating for large companies and against the interest of workers. Representing corporate giants like Walmart and Boeing, Scalia has tirelessly fought against unions and legal protections for workers.

Scalia’s appointment is yet another example of the absurdity of depicting Trump, or Cotton, as populists. They’re tedious culture warriors, sure, but the actual policies they enact harm the interests of blue collar workers.

If confirmed, Scalia would replace Alex Acosta, who resigned amid a scandal over the sweetheart deal he gave convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when Acosta was a federal prosecutor in Florida. Epstein was at one time pals with Trump; NBC released a video this week of the two cavorting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Epstein’s heyday.

The New York Times has more on Scalia’s track record of fighting against workers’ rights and health benefits, including his longtime crusade against regulations protecting workers from repetitive stress injuries (“unreliable science,” said Scalia), his fight for Walmart against a Maryland law that would have required companies with more than 10,000 workers to devote more money to health care for their workers, and his defense of Boeing when it was accused of violating labor law for threatening to open another plant in South Carolina unless the union capitulated to a no-strike clause."

The Trump administration cannot point to another example of a treasury secretary intervening in a congressional request to release taxpayers returns, according to a Treasury Department letter released by a Democratic senator on Thursday.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly blocked House lawmakers’ demands that the Internal Revenue Service turn over six years of President Trump’s personal and financial tax returns, a battle that is headed to federal court.

Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, received the Treasury memo after blocking the president’s nominees to the department because it was not answering his questions about the fight over the president’s tax returns.

[House Democrats sue Trump administration over president’s tax returns]

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has demanded Trump’s returns under Section 6103(f) of the tax code, which states that the treasury secretary “shall furnish” tax returns requested by certain congressional bodies.

“We are not aware of whether a previous Treasury Secretary has directly responded to a section 6103(f) request before,” states the four-page memo, written by Justin W. Sok, senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs.

But Treasury’s memo also argues that the administration is also unaware of any other requests for tax records that elicited strong objections from the chair of the Finance Committee, a position held by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa.), or “presented such serious constitutional questions” as the one by House Democrats.

The memo may give ammunition to Democrats who have contended that Mnuchin has gone to extraordinary lengths to shield Trump’s personal financial records.

It also says the Trump administration cannot cite a prior instance in which the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel weighed in on a congressional request for private tax returns, although in at least one instance the OLC has given advice on congressional access to tax returns related to a subcommittee request. OLC provided an opinion to Mnuchin that has formed the basis for his denial of the records.

In a statement, Wyden said the letter “confirms that the Treasury Department has diverged from standard procedures in this case,” arguing that it reveals the “unprecedented process” by which the requests for Trump’s returns have been denied. Wyden said he will now allow the president’s nominations to the department to proceed through the Senate.

House Democrats filed a lawsuit earlier in federal court seeking access to Trump’s tax returns, accusing the administration of an “extraordinary attack” on Congress in preventing the disclosure of his records.

Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign in a break with decades of precedent. He has told advisers that he is willing to take the fight to the Supreme Court. He has publicly argued that the tax returns were an issue in the 2016 election but that they should no longer be of concern because he won.

Democrats have cited both the law and an internal IRS memo that says Congress must be given the returns unless the president invokes executive privilege, which he has not.

But in its June memo, the Treasury Department argues that the Democrats’ request for Trump’s returns are unlike any other prior request.

“The vast majority of disclosures to congressional committees under section 6103(f) consist of statistical studies, compilations, and other data products . . . provided for statistical purposes,” the Treasury memo states. “The requests for this information do not identify specific taxpayers.”

Steve Rosenthal, a legal expert at the Tax Policy Center, said the memo “confirms there has been a special process for reviewing requests related to President Trump.”

However, even some critics of Mnuchin’s decision say it is understandable that he played a role. “The conclusion Secretary Mnuchin reached is wrong. But, that said, I don’t think there’s anything wrong about the treasury secretary playing a role in the decision,” said Daniel Hemel, a legal expert at the University of Chicago."

SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!

THE EPA’S CURIOUS RESPONSE TO MASSIVE COAL PLANT CLOSURE: The Trump administration is seeking to reassure coal industry allies that it was not the driving force behind a decision by a utility Thursday to shut down a massive Indiana coal plant.

The Environmental Protection Agency issued a statement Thursday night saying it “did not seek retirement” of a 1,300 megawatt coal unit run by American Electric Power, and affirming that EPA “supports power generation from all sources of energy.”

Environmentalist critics of the administration and even allies said EPA’s response was unusual, given the agency’s past role in filing a legal case against AEP that ultimately concluded in the utility deciding to close the coal plant.

Ohio-based AEP will retire the Rockport coal unit by 2028, which would be the largest single coal plant to be retired since 2010. The unit has existed since 1984.

“This is truly bizarre and bend-over-backwards craven,” John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) told me. “I have never seen anything like this in my 25 years as a Clean Air Act attorney. It's just political simpering to make sure it’s known the Trump administration does not agree with a company's own decision to retire a coal unit it owns.”

How the story begins: The story with the Rockport coal plant began in 2007, when AEP reached a deal with the George W. Bush administration EPA, several northeastern states, and environmental groups including NRDC to settle allegations that the utility expanded the plant without obtaining proper permits and installing pollution control equipment. AEP denied the allegations, and the courts did not decide on its innocence or guilt.

The so-called consent agreement has been revised 5 times since 2007, with AEP as part of the initial iterations, committing to install pollution control technologies. The Trump administration inherited the case when it took power in 2017.

AEP changes course: In May, the parties agreed to one last change to the agreement. Rather than continuing to install expensive pollution control equipment, AEP decided it would be less costly to simply retire the plant.

Judge Edmund Sargus of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio signed off on the agreement Thursday, permitting AEP to retire the coal plant.

Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for AEP, told me the utility decided to retire the coal plant for economic reasons, as it transitions to cleaner fuel sources. She said the Trump administration EPA, as a party to the consent decree, signed off on the changes.

“The consent decree was agreed to by all the parties,” McHenry said. “The administration’s position on coal and fuel diversity has been very clear. We still have coal. We still believe in fuel diversity. But for this coal unit, it makes sense for us to retire it.”

The decision comes as AEP aims to reduce coal use from nearly half its electricity mix to 27% by 2030, while cutting its carbon emissions 80% by 2050.

""Our investments are focused on renewable generation and advanced technologies that enhance service for our customers,"" AEP CEO Nicholas Akins said in a statement Thursday.

So why is EPA making this a big deal? EPA spokesman Michael Abboud clarified to me that the agency, by issuing its statement distancing itself from AEP’s decision, is not “registering opposition” to the utility’s move to close the coal plant. He said the agency sought to counter “inaccurate reporting” that he said was “conflating” EPA’s role in the decision, as if the agency mandated it.

To Walke, that’s beside the point.

“This is what the company wanted,” he said of AEP retiring the plant. “You can’t stop them.”

Jeff Holmstead, a Trump administration ally and attorney with the firm Bracewell, which represents coal-burning utilities, said that EPA’s statement seemed like it was meant to give the agency political cover.

“The EPA under this administration does not want anyone to believe the agency is forcing the closure of coal plants,” Holmstead told me. “The EPA’s statement just reflects the fact that our president has been very pro-coal and they don't want to be accused of undermining that.”

NEW YORK ANNOUNCES LARGEST OFFSHORE WIND CONTRACT IN US HISTORY: New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday that his state awarded the nation’s largest offshore wind agreement as part of an aggressive plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy.

New York selected Danish power company Orstead and Norway-based oil and gas giant Equinor to build two wind projects off the coast of Long Island, totaling 1,700 megawatts, enough to power more than 1 million homes in the state. The projects will become operational within the next five years.

“With this agreement, New York will lead the way in developing the largest source of offshore wind power in the nation,” said Cuomo, a Democrat.

The announcement continues growing momentum for the young U.S. offshore wind industry, which has lagged that of Europe, where the energy source is cheap and has benefited from subsidies.

So far, Block Island, a small 30-megawatt wind farm off the Rhode Island coast that can power 17,000 homes, is the nation's only offshore project. Utility Dominion Energy began construction this month on a second offshore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia.

CUOMO ALSO SIGNS NET-ZERO EMISSIONS BILL: Cuomo made the offshore wind announcement after he signed a law passed by the state legislature last month requiring New York to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across all sectors of the economy.

The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, considered the most aggressive climate legislation in the country, would require New York to cut its emissions 85% below 1990 levels by 2050, and offset the remaining 15% through methods such as carbon capture.

Its net-zero emissions by 2050 target is a state-level version of what many Democratic nominees for president have called for at the federal level.

As part of its goal, New York would have to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and use entirely carbon-free power by 2040. The offshore wind project will help meet that goal.

New York currently gets about 60% of its electricity from carbon-free sources, mostly from hydro and nuclear power.

New York’s net-zero bill also applies to harder-to-decarbonize sectors such as transportation, buildings, and industrial facilities.

TRUMP SAYS US SHOT DOWN IRANIAN DRONE OVER STRAIT OF HORMUZ: The U.S. military shot down an Iranian drone threatening a U.S. warship in the Strait of Hormuz, President Trump said Thursday.

The U.S. took action amid escalating tensions with the Middle East country, and continued jostling in the Strait of Hormuz, a 21-mile-wide waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. About 18.5 million barrels of oil travel through it daily, accounting for approximately 30% of the world's sea-traded oil. The U.S. has imposed strict sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.

Trump announced that the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer “took defensive action” and “immediately destroyed” the drone, which he said came too close for comfort to the ship.

“This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters,” Trump said at a press conference.

A statement issued by Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman used more careful language, which stopped short of claiming the drone was shot down or destroyed. “A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range,” Hoffman said. “The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.”

Iran denies its drone was shot down: Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi mocked the accusation on Friday, and a spokesman for the Iranian military called the U.S. version of events “delusional and groundless,” according to CNN.

“We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else,” Araghchi tweeted . “ I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!”

BIPARTISAN GROUP RELEASES BILL TO BOOST RENEWABLES ON PUBLIC LANDS: A bipartisan group of more than two dozen House members introduced legislation Thursday to boost renewable energy development on public lands.

The Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act would streamline permitting of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands. It establishes a revenue-sharing mechanism from the energy production that seeks to ensure a fair return among relevant stakeholders, including the state and counties hosting the development.

About 15% of the revenues will be used to help speed the processing of permit applications and reducing a backlog of renewable energy permits on public lands.

""This bipartisan bill will cut red tape standing in the way of developing renewable energy across America's public lands,” said Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, the lead co-sponsor of the bill with Democrat Mike Levin of California.

House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva of Arizona and top Republican Rob Bishop of Utah also co-sponsored the bill, an unusual alliance given their usual feuding over energy issues.

“Supporting all energy resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal ensures a reliable and affordable domestic energy supply while supporting well-paying American jobs,” Bishop said.

BISHOP RECONSIDERS PLAN TO RETIRE IN 2020: Bishop may not retire in 2020 as originally planned, he told reporters Thursday.

""I was surprised at the number of people who are asking me to reconsider it, and in deference I need to do that,"" he said, in comments reported by Politico and E&E News.

Bishop, 68, had indicated before winning re-election in 2018 that he planned to retire instead of running for a tenth-term in 2020.

But Bishop now says he will officially announce a decision on whether to run again July 29 in Utah. Bishop is a supporter of Trump’s agenda to expand energy development on public lands, and was influential in pushing the president to shrink the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante national monuments in Utah.

Bishop has served two of his terms (four years) as chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, which oversees public lands policy and the Interior Department. This is his first two-year term as ranking member. GOP House rules limit chairs and ranking members to six years atop a committee, so Bishop could not serve in those positions again if he were to run and win in 2020.

Why the V.A. Won’t Pay for Service Dogs to Treat PTSD,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jasper Craven'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/service-dogs-veterans-ptsd.html,"[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more stories about veterans and V.A. policy.]

The V.A. is currently conducting research into the effectiveness of service dogs, but the process has been slow. Research started in 2011 was supposed to wrap up in 2015 but has repeatedly been stalled by problems with the study’s design and execution. In May, the V.A. said the findings of the study, which has cost $16 million to date, would be released to the public in 2020.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are growing impatient with what they perceive as a lack of initiative at a time when there is a growing mental-health crisis in America’s veterans community. In June, Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, reintroduced the PAWS Act, to establish a $10 million grant program through the V.A., which would give qualified nonprofit organizations up to $25,000 for each veteran they pair with a service dog. The stipend would cover the canine’s training, and the training of the recipient with his or her service dog. The bill is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, pitting lawmakers against the V.A., which is refusing to endorse any new stopgap service-dog program before its internal research is completed.

Stuck in the middle are the veterans themselves. Among those receiving disability benefits from the V.A., more than one in five suffers from PTSD. Veterans who have responded poorly to conventional treatments have had to improvise, sometimes by paying thousands of dollars up front to acquire service dogs, then covering the significant costs of feeding and caring for them. To make matters worse, veterans seeking service dogs without any support from the V.A. are forced to wade into a largely unregulated industry: Some end up with a dog that provides few benefits because it isn’t properly trained. Veterans advocates say access to a psychiatric service dog without the associated financial burden can’t come soon enough.

In January 2009, Al Franken, fresh off his winning campaign for a Senate seat, met Luis Montalván, a medically retired Army captain who had served two tours as an intelligence officer in Iraq, and his golden retriever named Tuesday. Montalván had returned home with a shattered leg, spinal damage, a brain injury and PTSD symptoms that included vivid nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks and a fear of public spaces. The only therapy that eased Montalván’s symptoms was Tuesday, whom he received from a group called Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities. Tuesday sensed if Montalván’s breathing sharpened or he began to perspire, and then intervened with a nuzzle. If Tuesday noticed Montalván thrashing while asleep in bed, he would wake the former soldier from his nightmare with a series of sloppy face-licks. Tuesday was even trained to direct the Army veteran from his bed to his pill bottles each morning."
"Former Interior scientist calls out ‘culture of fear, censorship, and suppression’ under Trump",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/former-interior-scientist-calls-out-culture-of-fear-censorship-and-suppression-under-trump-2b8813e95b18/,"There is a “culture of fear, censorship, and suppression” within the Trump administration that is impeding government scientists from doing their best work, former Interior Department policy director and scientist turned whistleblower Joel Clement warned on Wednesday.

Speaking to lawmakers on the House Science Committee, scientific experts spoke about the need for stronger rules to support the integrity of their research and ensure that political agendas don’t dictate or interfere with the data.

“There is not Democratic science, there is not Republican science, there is just science,” said Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Halpern pointed to instances under current and previous administrations, including under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, of scientific assessments being either watered down or language softened. He pointed to past research on lead in school lunchboxes and on the impact of fracking on drinking water.

But the scientists said that under President Donald Trump, political interference had reached a new level.

As Clement highlighted, a study into the rules needed to protect the health and safety of offshore oil rig workers was canceled right before a set of measures to protect the workers was rolled-back. Similarly, a study into the health impacts of surface coal mining was canceled right before making moves to support the coal industry.

Other studies have been delayed, such as one on the health impacts of PFAS chemicals in drinking water for fear of a “public relations nightmare,” while agencies have seen some scientists self-censor their work out of fear, such as removing the words “climate change” from reports.

“The American people lose when we end up with manipulated, suppressed, or distorted information,” Halpern said. After all, as multiple experts testified, it’s taxpayer money that funds government scientists — the public paid for that research and deserves to see it.

The result is “dirtier air, dirtier water,” added Clement, who resigned from his post at the Interior in July 2017 after being reassigned to “an unrelated job” by former Secretary Ryan Zinke. Clement saw the move as an attempt to push him out for speaking out about the impacts of climate change on Alaskan native communities.

The hearing on Wednesday follows the release of a bill by committee member Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), called the Scientific Integrity Act, earlier this year. The bill, which has the support of nearly 200 House members, is intended to insulate “public scientific research and reports from the distorting influence of political and special interests” according to Tonko.

While Tonko reminded everyone at the hearing that he began working on the bill in 2016 under the Obama administration, he added, “The abuses directed by this President [Trump] and his top officials have brought a new urgency to the issue.”

While more than 20 federal agencies have some type of scientific integrity policy, not all of these policies are successfully or fully implemented. As an April report by the Government Accountability Office found, of the nine agencies reviewed, seven have “specific, documented procedures” for identifying and addressing alleged violations. The report also made 10 recommendations to agencies for addressing the need to better educate staff on the issue, provide greater oversight, and develop procedures to identify and address potential violations.

Last year, the EPA announced it would begin an investigation to see whether its scientific integrity policy was being properly implemented. This came after a survey was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which showed that government scientists across 16 agencies and departments had concerns with the degree of political influence over their work.

Specifically, the annual survey for 2018 showed that a third of the nearly 449 EPA respondents worried about the “influence” of political appointees or White House officials over “science-based” decisions. Less than 30% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “My agency adheres to its scientific integrity policy.”

In addition, roughly a third of EPA respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they had either been asked directly to omit or independently decided to avoid the use of the term “climate change” in their work.

There is technically nothing stopping an agency from dismantling its scientific integrity policy, said Halpern. That’s why a bill such as the one proposed by Tonko would go a long way to buttress, or add “statutory heft,” to agency policies as Clement described.

Clement called the Scientific Integrity Act a good first step, but noted that in order to be truly effective, broader ethics and integrity standards were needed across agencies.

Indeed, many of the individuals overseeing agencies come from the industry they are now responsible for regulating. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Interior (DOI) have faced numerous ethics scandals regarding potential conflicts of interest and alleged industry influence.

In March, for instance, The New York Times revealed documents showing DOI Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to block a study showing pesticides might threaten the existence of 1,200 endangered species; Bernhardt has a history of lobbying against the Endangered Species Act.

But due to the “hostile leadership situation,” there are many scientists who are simply keeping their heads down and staying quiet about issues surrounding scientific integrity under the current administration.

“I’d love if every policymaker thought of science as the North Star,” said Clement, “but I hope it’s part of the constellation.”"
EPA worker rights under White House assault,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/453710-epa-worker-rights-under-white-house-assault,"Last week, the Trump administration executed another step in its plan to dismantle the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Step one was appointing agency leaders who don’t support EPA’s mission. Step two was throwing out rules designed to protect the public from pollution and from climate change. Now comes step three: stripping EPA employees of rights and unilaterally changing employment conditions that are essential to maintaining a functioning workplace.

While running for office in 2016, Donald Trump told Fox News that, if elected, he would dismantle EPA to the point where there would be only “little tidbits left.” Unless Congress steps in, this goal will soon be in sight.

On July 8 – the same day President Trump Donald John TrumpLiz Cheney: 'Send her back' chant 'inappropriate' but not about race, gender Booker: Trump is 'worse than a racist' Top Democrat insists country hasn't moved on from Mueller MORE gave a fantastical speech boasting of “incredible” environmental achievements – his administration announced it was throwing out years of past agreements between EPA management and our union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and imposing new workplace edicts on two-thirds of the workforce as AFGE represents nearly 8,000 EPA workers.

These new workplace rules, which were not negotiated with the union and not agreed to by employees, will have far-reaching consequences on employees and the work that they do.

For instance, the new directive nearly eliminates the option for most employees to work from alternative work locations closer to where they live. For an agency that is supposed to be committed to reducing carbon emissions, minimizing commutes for its own employees should be a high priority. Over the past decade, EPA has steadily increased the availability of telework to the point where many employees rely heavily on that option – not only to reduce commute times, but to balance childcare and other obligations. With that option yanked away, many employees will choose other employment alternatives – especially any that are closer to home.

Additionally, the unilateral directive denies workers due process by limiting workers’ access to grievance procedures and preventing union representatives from meeting with employees and managers to resolve disputes. Denying workers due process in this way creates an untenable work situation for employees.

In the Bay Area, this action initially and primarily hurts the staff-level attorneys who work at EPA’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office (EPA Region 9) in San Francisco and are members of AFGE Local 1236. They handle mission-critical cases that include cleaning up Superfund sites, pursuing clean air and clean water cases in court, prosecuting environmental crimes, cleaning up oil spills, enforcing hazardous waste and toxic substances laws, and much more – all to protect the American public and the environment from diverse and complex environmental burdens and disasters. And they have been doing this vital work despite severe staffing and budget cuts over the past several years.

Unfortunately, the administration’s attack on our workplace rights and protections isn’t isolated to EPA. At agency after agency – Education, Health and Human Services, Social Security, Veterans Affairs – political appointees are hijacking the collective bargaining process in an attempt to force through anti-worker provisions. Many of these proposals mirror those contained in three executive orders President Trump issued in May 2018 that were subsequently ruled illegal by a federal judge.

The administration’s rejection of labor rights is part of a broader effort to silence federal workers and gut workplace rights. It is precisely these benefits that make it possible for many of those employees to stay at the EPA, working toward a cleaner and safer environment for all of us.

If the administration succeeds in enforcing these anti-labor directives, EPA and other federal agencies will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining employees who perform critical services on behalf of our country. That is clearly the intent of the Trump administration, which sees federal employees as the enemy.

As employees leave the agency, most are never replaced, and access to clean air and clean water and safe places for our families to live and play will steadily dwindle. We all need to let our senators and congressional representatives know that we value the work of the EPA and other federal agencies and ask them to intervene before the damage that is being done to EPA and other agencies across the government becomes permanent.

USDA Identifies Two Monsanto Strains in Rogue GMO Wheat in Washington State,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-identifies-two-monsanto-strains-in-rogue-gmo-wheat-in-washington-state,"The GMO wheat discovered growing wild in a Washington State field this spring actually sprouted from two different strains developed by Monsanto, the USDA announced over the weekend. Genetically engineered wheat is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world, yet volunteer herbicide-resistant plants have been confirmed four times in the U.S. Northwest more than a decade after field trials ended.

In the latest case, USDA said “thorough testing” identified the wheat as Monsanto strains MON 71300 and MON 71800. The MON 71800 strain also was identified in the first U.S. case of rogue GMO wheat, in eastern Oregon in 2013. The same strain was found growing wild in 2014 at a Montana State University research farm in Huntley, Montana. A different strain, MON 71700, was found in 22 wheat plants in a field in Washington State in 2016.

“There is no evidence that any GE wheat has entered commerce or is in the food supply,” said USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in an update of the new case. It has issued similar conclusions on the past incidents. And, as in the past, it cited the FDA position that there would be no safety concerns if low levels of the wheat varieties were present in the food supply.

A test kit will be offered to U.S. trading partners to identify MON 71300, said the APHIS. Previously, the USDA has provided test kits for the two other strains. Japan and South Korea, two major importers of wheat from the U.S. Northwest, have tested wheat shipments for GMO content since 2013 and have not found issues with the U.S. grain.

Unlike previous incidents, neither Japan nor South Korea interrupted purchases of U.S. wheat following the announcement of rogue wheat in Washington State. Last year, the two countries halted purchases of Canadian wheat for a month due to confirmation of GE wheat along an access road in southern Alberta.

Washington State often is the fourth-largest wheat-growing state in the nation. The Washington Grain Commission says 85% to 90% of the state’s wheat is exported, mainly to Pacific Rim nations.

In the three other U.S. incidents, the USDA did not identify the source of the wheat seeds or how a GMO variety survived in the wild. In all of the incidents, the plants attracted attention because they did not die when sprayed with a weedkiller. Monsanto genetically modified wheat to tolerate doses of Roundup herbicide.

The Trump administration is a supporter of U.S. agricultural biotechnology. President Trump signed an executive order in mid-June to modernize ag biotech and, referring to gene-edited crops and livestock, told the USDA, FDA, and EPA to use their existing powers “to exempt low-risk products of agricultural biotechnology for undue regulation.”
