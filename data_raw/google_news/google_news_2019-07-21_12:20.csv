Lara Trump lashes out after CNN host accuses her of 'lying' about rally crowd's ‘Send her back!’ chant,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Dom Calicchio', 'Lara Trump', ""Cnn'S Anderson Cooper""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lara-trump-lashes-out-after-cnn-host-accuses-her-of-lying-about-rally-crowds-send-her-back-chant,"Lara Trump fired back Saturday against critics who’ve asserted that the “Send her back!” chant at President Trump’s recent rally in North Carolina was planned, instead of a spontaneous crowd response.

“Anyone insinuating that there was some premeditated plan to orchestrate the ‘send her back’ chant is obviously desperate to continue pushing a biased, racially-charged narrative,” the president’s daughter-in-law wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

She added the hashtag, #FakeNews.

Lara Trump’s message was in response to a Saturday article in the Washington Examiner that reported CNN’s Anderson Cooper had criticized her on Friday’s edition of his nightly program, “Anderson Cooper 360.”

TRUMP SLAMS PROGRESSIVE CONGRESSWOMEN AT FIERY 'MAGA' RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA

“She’s just friggin’ lying,” Cooper said at one point, accusing the wife of Eric Trump of misrepresenting the North Carolina situation during her interview earlier Friday on the Fox Business Network, the Examiner reported.

“She’s just friggin’ lying.” — CNN's Anderson Cooper

Lara Trump had said that the “send her back” chant – which the crowd directed at Somali-born U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – was not prompted and that President Trump did not join in.

“It wasn’t the whole crowd,” she added. “It was just a couple of people right there in the front, but [the president] didn’t say it.”

But Cooper argued that Lara Trump had “primed” the crowd during her warm-up speech prior to the president’s appearance Wednesday in Greenville, N.C., the Examiner reported.

“If you don’t love our country, the president said it, ‘You can leave,’ right?” Lara Trump is heard saying in a video clip before the president took the stage.

But Lara Trump was not shown coaching the crowd to chant, “Send her back!” -- contrary to what Cooper appeared to be suggesting.

Following Wednesday’s rally, critics of President Trump latched onto the chant to advance their argument that some Twitter messages from the president earlier in the week – targeting Omar and other far-left House Democrats known as “The Squad” – were racist.

But the president pushed back against the racism argument, saying he was merely opposing what he viewed as the Democrats’ negative attitudes toward America – and that his tweets had nothing to do with race.

“I was not happy with it, I disagree with it,” President Trump said Thursday, referring to the rally crowd’s “Send her back!” chant. “But again, I didn’t say that, they did.”"

The remark came nearly a week after the president tweeted that Omar and three other members of “the Squad” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.

""Then come back and show us how it is done,"" the president added.

Trump also defended his supporters at last week's North Carolina rally who chanted “Send her back!” in reference to Omar -- something that, along with the tweets, was viewed by most Democrats and some Republicans as racially insensitive.

""Those are incredible patriots,” Trump told reporters, referring to the Wednesday crowd in Greenville, N.C. “But I’m unhappy when a congresswoman goes and says, 'I’m going to be the president’s nightmare.'

""She’s going to be the president’s nightmare? She’s lucky to be where she is, let me tell you. And the things that she has said are a disgrace to our country.”

Omar came to the United States as a Somali refugee when she was a teen and is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

On Friday morning, Trump tweeted that the “fake news media” had become “crazed” over the “Send her back!” chant and asserted that a gathering of supporters greeting Omar at a Minnesota airport last week had been “staged.”

On Saturday, an Omar ally, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., defended her fellow Democrat, claiming Trump had ""relished' in the anti-Omar chanting at the rally.

""He kind of presided over the situation, he relished it, he took it in,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at a town hall on immigration in her New York City district.

When a reporter asked her whether she believed Trump had led the crowd on, Ocasio-Cortez replied: ""He absolutely did.""

Trump Administration Revising U.S. Citizenship Test,https://www.npr.org,['Shannon Van Sant'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/20/743786884/trump-administration-revising-u-s-citizenship-test,"Trump Administration Revising U.S. Citizenship Test

The Trump administration is planning changes to the U.S. citizenship test. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says it is revising the test to ensure that ""it continues to serve as an accurate measure of a naturalization applicant's civics knowledge.""

The test was introduced in 1986 and last revised in 2008. In a USCIS statement, acting Director Ken Cuccinelli said, ""Updating, maintaining, and improving a test that is current and relevant is our responsibility as an agency in order to help potential new citizens fully understand the meaning of U.S. citizenship and the values that unite all Americans.""

Since assuming office, President Trump has attempted to implement broad changes to U.S. immigration laws and policies. Last week, the Trump administration announced a new rule requiring asylum-seekers to first apply for asylum in at least one country they pass through on their journey to the U.S.

The administration has also argued for a citizenship question to be added to the 2020 census. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang and Franco Ordonez reported on Trump's recent decision to drop those efforts. Instead, they wrote, Trump announced he ""would sign an executive order to obtain data about the U.S. citizenship and noncitizenship status of everyone living in the United States.""

Cuccinelli spoke with The Washington Post about changes to the U.S. citizenship test, which the USCIS plans to launch in December 2020 or early 2021. ""Isn't everybody always paranoid that this is used for ulterior purposes?"" Cuccinelli said. ""Of course, they're going to be sorely disappointed when it just looks like another version of a civics exam. I mean that's pretty much how it's going to look.""

In a statement, the USCIS said it had formed a naturalization test revision working group in December 2018 with ""members from across the agency."" The USCIS said it is ""soliciting the input of experts in the field of adult education to ensure that this process is fair and transparent.""

The exam currently asks applicants 10 randomly generated questions from a list of 100. The questions focus on three subjects: American government, American history and integrated civics, which includes American geography, symbols and holidays. Applicants for U.S. citizenship must get at least six out of the 10 questions correct to pass the test.

Last year, the USCIS naturalized more than 750,000 people, which the agency says is a five-year high. The USCIS reports a national pass rate of 90% for the citizenship test and says a pilot of its revisions will be rolled out this fall.

Then-USCIS Director Francis Cissna first announced upcoming revisions to the test in May. Cissna wrote, ""Citizenship is the culmination of an immigrant's journey to fully join our nation and live with us in a common bond ... By revising this test every 10 years, we can ensure that the civics education requirements remain a meaningful aspect of the naturalization process."""
Opinion | How Democrats Defeat Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Frank Bruni'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/opinion/sunday/trump-squad-democrats-2020.html,"According to a May analysis by Catalist, a data-analysis firm, 89 percent of the Democratic vote gain in 2018 was from swing voters . That’s just one set of numbers, one way to slice the pie, but it does raise questions about the progressive insistence that partisan turnout and a surge in new voters, attracted by bold policy positions, is the path to victory in 2020.

There’s something else funky about that insistence — about the theory that a more progressive Democratic nominee would get all the votes that Hillary Clinton did in 2016 plus ones from people who stayed home in disaffection and much of the left-wing spoiler Jill Stein’s share. A more progressive nominee might lose some of the votes that Clinton did get. Who’s to say that the math, in the end, would be all that favorable?

But that hasn’t stopped the leftward lunge of leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, several of whom want “Medicare for all” and many of whom support the decriminalization of illegal border crossings.

That puts them on shaky ground. Polling has shown that when voters are told that Medicare for all would mean an end to private insurance or an increase in taxes, support for it drops below 40 percent.

And according to a Politico/Morning Consult survey published a few days ago, 51 percent of voters support the sweeping raids by ICE that the president trumpets, while just 35 percent oppose them. That suggests that anything that smacks of open borders — which is how President Barack Obama’s secretary for homeland security, Jeh Johnson, described Democratic presidential candidates’ positions in a recent op-ed essay in The Washington Post — puts those candidates at odds with public opinion. Voters see them answering Trump’s extremism with extremism of a different kind.

Which isn’t entirely wrong. Reeling from the ugliness of his actions and words — which are meant to make them reel — Democrats want to repudiate him as forcefully as possible. But that can lead to a reaction that’s neither smart politics nor good policy.

Nancy Pelosi knows this. It’s why she hasn’t been talking up the Green New Deal, single-payer insurance or impeachment, and the suggestion that this makes her some squishy centrist pushover — some musty relic from a timid era — is bunk. She has her eyes on the most meaningful prize, one she pursued successfully in the midterms: Democratic victory. And she can see that in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll published a little over a week ago, just 21 percent of registered voters said that there was enough evidence for Congress to begin impeachment hearings."

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call ""a truly monumental effort"" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year.

Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington.

About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said.

The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December.

Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access.

""The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.

Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law.

Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program.

In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would ""vigilantly"" review the new risk assessment system.

""It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,"" the senators said.

Questions about implementation

The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress.

""The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' "" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year.

""We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,"" they said.

Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable.

Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general.

""There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,"" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network.

""We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.""

Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference.

""Every day of freedom is important,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early."""
It’s time to break up DHS.,https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/aoc-dhs-break-up.html,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got at least one thing right this week: The Department of Homeland Security should be abolished.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed breaking up DHS in a radio interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, after which several Republicans began hammering her for the idea. “Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney exclaimed to a reporter. “Moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb,” GOP strategist Karl Rove sputtered on Fox News.

It’s unclear why Dick Cheney’s daughter and George W. Bush’s former White House deputy chief of staff should find AOC’s suggestion so outrageous. A Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, first proposed creating DHS in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to show that his party could get serious about terrorism too—and then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the idea, saying that it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. That proved to be an understatement.

Bush finally relented after the 9/11 Commission concluded that the attacks happened, in part, because the FBI and the CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ movements prior to the attack. This overstated the case, but suddenly consolidation became a popular nostrum to our problems, and in 2002, Bush signed Lieberman’s idea into law.

The organizations that didn’t consolidate—the CIA and FBI, the culprits that mishandled intelligence about al-Qaida in the first place—elevated their counterterrorism units, redirected their focus, and strung new lines of communications between them. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security subsumed 22 agencies from eight federal departments—with a combined budget of $40 billion (back then) and a payroll of 183,000 employees—into one hydra-headed, crossbred, poorly conceived monstrosity.

It wasn’t just the size that was the problem: Most of these agencies had been performing distinct functions; shmooshing them together wouldn’t necessarily make them more cohesive or efficient. In fact, it made each component less effective. Several of those agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who could focus laser-like on their specific domains and had the clout to request direct access to the president. This is no longer true. The Secretary of Homeland Security, even a very good one, has the time and bandwidth to focus on maybe two or three of the department’s 22 areas. The other areas are now handled by undersecretaries or assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries—people with less clout and less access, leaving issues less attended.

The place is a well-known mishmash unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made, and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Here’s one example: In the early 1990s, when the U.S. government started addressing cybersecurity, the Defense Department created a specially staffed joint task force for “computer network defense.” It had bureaucratic clashes with similar but separate units in the Air Force and the National Security Agency, but those in charge were beginning to figure out how to work together.

DHS is unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made—and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Then, after 9/11, it was decided that DHS would be responsible for defending the nation from cyberattacks (though the Pentagon and the NSA would remain in charge of protecting defense networks). The system of interagency arrangements, which had slowly been evolving, fell apart. DHS lacked the resources and know-how for its mission. During the early Obama administration, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the DHS and NSA to work together in crises, but it was sabotaged by a DHS deputy who opposed any plan that helped turn the internet into a “war zone.” (The deputy was a few years late on trying to stop that development.)

DHS has probably also had a deleterious effect on protecting security and civil liberties on the southern border, the main topic of Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns. Before 9/11, border matters were handled by the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Services, which the DHS fused into a new agency, Customs and Border Patrol.

Customs and the INS were run as fairly professional law enforcement agencies, with varying degrees of laxity or fervency, depending on the times. Under a more normal administration, CBP might still operate in that manner. But lassoed into a political department and run by a handpicked operative, it has turned into an enforcement squad for Trump’s obsessively anti-immigrant agenda. Even under Trump’s orders, would the competent bureaucrats of the old Customs Service have herded children into cages? Maybe. But they might have handled things in a more professional fashion because it would have been an independent agency following its own rules and codes, rather than a subset of a super-agency run by a political appointee.

Bureaucratic routines and regulations sometime serve a laudable purpose.

It’s very hard to turn back the clock to 2001 and dissolve DHS into its once separate components, especially since most people don’t remember or even knowthat it wasn’t always this way. But maybe we should try. Republicans talk about dissolving federal agencies all the time. As Ocasio-Cortez put it in a clarifying tweet: “Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.”"
U.S. State Department says concerned by reports of Chinese interference in South China Sea,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea/u-s-state-department-says-concerned-by-reports-of-chinese-interference-in-south-china-sea-idUSKCN1UF0EM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it is concerned by reports of China’s interference with oil and gas activities in the South China Sea, including Vietnam’s long-standing exploration and production activities.

“China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states threatens regional energy security and undermines the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market,” the State Department said in a statement.

Vietnam on Friday accused a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and demanded that China remove the ships from Vietnamese waters.

Vietnam and China have for years long been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters in the South China Sea.

On Wednesday, two U.S.-based think tanks reported that Chinese and Vietnamese vessels had engaged in a standoff lasting several weeks near an oil block in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone. Neither Beijing nor Hanoi have directly confirmed or denied the reports.

“The United States firmly opposes coercion and intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims,” the State Department said.

“China should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,” it added.

The State Department also pointed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments earlier this year when he said, “by blocking development in the South China Sea through coercive means, China prevents ASEAN members from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves.”

The State Department also said that China’s growing pressure on ASEAN countries to accept provisions that seek to restrict their right to partner with third party companies or countries further reveal its intent to assert control over oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.

“China’s reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea...including the use of maritime militia to intimidate, coerce, and threaten other nations, undermine the peace and security of the region,” it said."
"For 50 years since Apollo 11, presidents have tried to take that next giant leap",https://indianexpress.com,[],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/for-50-years-since-apollo-11-presidents-have-tried-to-take-that-next-giant-leap-5838966/,"Written by Peter Baker

At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Donald Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death.

The presidents who followed Kennedy accomplished remarkable things in space, including the development of the reusable space shuttle, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope and its offspring, the robot exploration of the solar system and the construction of the International Space Station along with Russia and other partners. Yet none of it ever fired the national imagination as did humans traveling to other worlds.

“There was a time when science and space exploration just captured the soul of America,” said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian at Rice University and author of “American Moonshot,” a new book on Kennedy and the space race. “The problem is it’s easy to say, ‘Let’s go back to the moon and to Mars,’ but as they used to say in NASA — ‘No bucks, no Buck Rogers.’”

Indeed, other presidents never made it the priority Kennedy did, regardless of their sweeping words. “The key factor is they’re not willing to pay for it,” said John M. Logsdon, a prominent space historian and professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “Kennedy not only talked the talk, but walked the walk. None of the presidents since then have been willing to do anything like that.”

Advocates of space exploration hope Trump will succeed with his moon program, called Artemis, for the mythical Apollo’s goddess sister, if for no other reason than his relentlessness when he applies himself to a project or a cause. Being the president who returned humanity to the moon on the way to Mars would be the sort of splashy, high-profile spectacle that excites him.

Trump hosted Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and the family of Neil Armstrong on Friday in the Oval Office to mark what the president called “one of the great achievements ever.” Vice President Mike Pence, who heads a reconstituted National Space Council, plans to visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday.

“NASA is back,” Trump boasted.

The hurdles, however, remain sky-high. Pence told NASA in March to accelerate its schedule to reach the moon by 2024, the end of Trump’s second term if he wins reelection. NASA shook up its management to meet that goal. But Congress has shown less interest in financing it, and the technical obstacles to such a timetable remain formidable.

Kranz himself highlighted the challenge in an appearance this week at Purdue University, saying the national environment had changed. “Today, you have this marvelous technology — the books have been written, the kids are educated,” he said. “What we need is leadership that says, ‘Let’s go,’ and then you need unity within the nation that’s going to make it happen.”

Kennedy was “not that interested in space.” He was keen to compete.

Kennedy’s moon mission was born not out of the explorer spirit but a desperation to catch up in a space race the United States was losing. The Soviets had beaten the Americans by launching the first satellite into orbit in 1957 and, just three months after Kennedy’s inauguration in 1961, the first man. In a memo a week later, Kennedy demanded any space initiative that “promises dramatic results in which we could win.”

The answer was the moon. Six weeks after Yuri Gagarin’s orbit, Kennedy addressed Congress to set a goal, “before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” He followed up a year later in a landmark speech at Rice University: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

For Kennedy, it was all about Cold War competition. “I’m not that interested in space,” he told his NASA administrator in a private meeting, where he made clear that space priorities other than a lunar landing meant little to him — as did arriving on the moon second.

Because of an assassin’s bullet, though, it fell to his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson — who unlike Kennedy was genuinely invested in space — to build the moon program into what it would be. While the space project enjoyed only shallow public support given its cost, the assassination made it a moral imperative to fulfill the martyred leader’s vision.

But it would be their mutual rival, Richard M. Nixon, who would preside over the landing on July 20, 1969. Nixon relished making what he called the “most historic phone call ever made from the White House” to speak with Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon. But beyond that, Nixon was not especially engaged in the space program, which was seen as a Kennedy legacy.

In March 1970, less than a year after the first landing, Nixon signed a directive making space just another program that would compete for funding along with every other, the turning point to Logsdon. As interest and television ratings for subsequent Apollo launches dwindled, the final three moon missions were scrapped, ending the program with Apollo 17 in 1972.

Nixon did authorize the development of the space shuttle, the principal path to space for Americans for decades to come, and he sealed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union that would lead to the docking of Apollo and Soyuz capsules in orbit in 1975 under his successor, Gerald R. Ford.

But the Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, while momentous geopolitically, also effectively ended the space race. If astronauts and cosmonauts could meet in space, there hardly seemed an urgent need to spend huge amounts of money on an antiquated competition. At its peak, NASA commanded more than 4% of the federal budget; today it receives about half of 1%.

“None of the administrations since Johnson were facing a proposition that what hung in the balance here was nothing less than the beginning of the end of the Cold War,” said Sean O’Keefe, a NASA administrator under George W. Bush. “This was a very dominant theme.”

Story Musgrave, a retired astronaut who flew six shuttle missions, said the original rationale for the space program proved to be its inescapable burden. “The trouble if you make it about winning is that when you win, you may not have” a reason to continue, he said. “Kennedy really did set us up for the total lack of vision that occurred after ’69 because we won.”

Presidential visions are undone by financial realities.

After a six-year hiatus, Americans returned to space in 1981 with the launch of the space shuttle Columbia only three months after Ronald Reagan took office.

Reagan embraced the program as a symbol of American optimism and ambition and, echoing Kennedy, announced to Congress in 1984 that he was directing NASA to build a permanently manned space station “and to do it within a decade.”

But Reagan was most remembered for his moving speech after the Challenger blew up in 1986, killing all seven on board, including teacher Christa McAuliffe. “Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue,” he told a television audience, concluding with a tribute to the crew. “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to touch the face of God.”

Hoping to reinvigorate the program, President George H.W. Bush announced on the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11, in 1989, an initiative to return to the moon and then to go to Mars. “Why the moon? Why Mars?” Bush asked. “Because it is humanity’s destiny to strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America’s destiny to lead.”

Logsdon, the historian, who has written several books on presidents and the space program — most recently one on Reagan, published this year — said Bush came the closest any president has come to matching Kennedy’s vision and budget commitment, but the price tag caused sticker shock in Congress, and the idea went nowhere.

When Bill Clinton took office, he revamped the program. “We had concluded that there was little point in putting astronauts on the moon again” unless it was done with a crewed base, recalled John Holdren, his science adviser. But as before, the estimated cost was enormous. “We saw no prospect of such a sum materializing.”

Instead, Clinton cut NASA’s budget and re-imagined the program as a vehicle for international cooperation, converting Reagan’s envisioned space station into a joint venture with Russia as it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union. By the time Clinton left office, Americans and Russians were living together on the International Space Station, and have since.

George W. Bush found himself repeating history. Like Reagan, it fell to him to pick NASA back up after a shuttle disaster when the Columbia broke apart on re-entry in 2003, killing all seven on board. A year later, Bush set in motion plans to retire the aging shuttles in favor of a new set of powerful rockets and a crew capsule.

And like his father, Bush aimed to return to the moon by 2020, followed by a mission to Mars. But even though Congress signed on and financed the start of the program, impatient politicians gave up when progress was slower and costlier than predicted.

Trump sends mixed signals about his moon plan.

Barack Obama seemed less interested in space and killed Bush’s Constellation program to build the Ares rockets and Orion capsule even after it had begun test launches, calling instead for outsourcing manned spaceflight to commercial companies. As a result, since the shuttles were retired in 2011, Americans have had to rely on paid rides to the space station on Russian rockets.

Obama saw no need to return to the moon, proposing instead to land astronauts on an asteroid by 2025 and then send them to Mars in the 2030s. Congressional Republicans scoffed and rejected the idea.

Trump came to office determined to reverse course, re-establishing the National Space Council abolished by Clinton. The president has relished surrounding himself with Apollo-era heroes like Kranz, Aldrin and moonwalker Harrison H. Schmitt.

But Trump seems more enchanted with his plan to create a military Space Force and sends mixed signals about his own exploration program. Just last month, he wrote on Twitter that “NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon,” but instead be focusing on Mars.

Even during Friday’s visit with the Apollo 11 crew, he began grilling Jim Bridenstine, his NASA administrator, on why the agency was not simply heading directly to Mars. “We need to learn how to live and work on another world,” Bridenstine explained.

Plenty of space program veterans doubt Trump will succeed. “I don’t think that whoever has opted for this goal has any idea about its cost or practicality,” Holdren said. “Sending humans to Mars would be such a complex and expensive proposition that I don’t believe it will be done at all unless major nations agree to do it together.”

Michael Foale, a retired astronaut who made extended stays on both the Russian space station Mir and the International Space Station, said the 2024 deadline “is highly unlikely to be achieved.” But he said he would “fully support” the idea of returning to the moon for a sustained stay, not just another one-off visit.

“The danger of a Kennedy-Trump-style ‘go to the moon’ — and then leave — is that it will disenchant another two generations of the world population with traveling to the moon even if it is successful, and much worse if an accident occurs,” Foale said.

Still, some past officials see reasons for optimism. “There’s a lot more going for this period of time and this initiative to make this a more possible event than what we’ve seen in the past,” O’Keefe said. “The technology has developed at an absolutely staggering pace that has made this an achievable objective. We know a lot more about what it will take to achieve it.”"

The Democratic senators are requesting the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice and Homeland Security provide them a briefing by July 22 to explain how they'll implement the border supplemental bill.

In addition to a briefing, Democrats have specific asks for each of the departments, including wanting a plan from HHS on how they plan to increase staff for and services offered by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a schedule from DHS for constructing new shelters and migrant processing facilities and an estimate from the Pentagon on how much it will cost to pay for activity-duty and National Guard deployments along the border.

Apollo’s 50th: A Look Back and a Look Forward,https://www.skyandtelescope.com,"['Megan Ray Nichols', 'View All Posts Megan Ray Nichols']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/apollos-50th-look-back-forward/,"July 20, 2019, marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, the first mission that successfully landed on the Moon. It's only fitting that NASA is now working toward sending astronauts back. Let's look back at the history of the first landing, and then forward toward NASA's Gateway and beyond.

Happy 50th, Apollo!

July 20, 2019 is the anniversary of the Apollo program’s most symbolic achievement — putting human beings on the Moon. In 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of the Moon as Michael Collins waited in orbit. When Neil Armstrong spoke the words, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” he renewed humanity’s drive to reach beyond Earth. As President John F. Kennedy had put it seven years earlier, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

NASA is planning a host of activities in July to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing. The Apollo/Saturn V Center at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida has received a makeover in advance of the celebration; now, guests will be able to explore a 3D model of the lander, leave their own footprints on a ""lunar surface,"" and even touch a real Moon rock. If you aren’t in Florida this July, check out NASA’s website for a list of anniversary events throughout the U.S. to find a celebration near you.

What Did We Learn From Apollo 11?

In 1969, we proved we could land on the Moon. But what else did we learn?

After Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the lunar surface, they collected samples of lunar “soil ” (or regolith) to return home for study. These experiments helped us determine the exact composition of the moon — and unfortunately, it is not made of cheese. When the samples were brought back home, scientists were able to measure the density, grain size, and other properties of the regolith.

They also took samples of the solar wind, using something you probably have in your kitchen — aluminum foil! The foil panel collected the atomic particles released by the sun so that scientists could figure out what exactly made up the solar winds. Back on Earth, scientists were able to measure isotopes of light noble gases in the solar wind, including helium, neon, and argon.

In addition to taking samples, Armstrong and Aldrin left behind seismometers to monitor moonquakes. Powered by solar panels, the last of these sensors shut down in 1981. They also left behind some lunar retroreflectors, which have helped astronomers determine the exact distance between Earth and our nearest natural satellite.

Returning to the Moon

Since the Apollo 11 landing, we’ve experienced 50 years of aerospace innovation and advancements — but we haven’t gone back to the Moon since Apollo 17’s crew landed in 1972. Rejoice, space fans — that's about to change. But returning astronauts to the Moon is still one of the most difficult things we’ll do in the next decade.

The Greek god Apollo may have brought us to the moon for the first time, but it's his twin sister Artemis that will be taking us back. NASA unveiled the Artemis program in May 2019, detailing what we could expect to see between now and when the craft is supposed to touch down on the lunar surface in 2024. NASA will use all means necessary to land at least two astronauts — the next man and the first woman— at the Moon’s south pole by 2024, as well as establish a sustainable presence on the satellite by 2028.

“Through the Artemis program, we will go to the Moon in a way we have never gone before – with innovative new technologies and systems to explore the entire lunar surface,” says Sean Potter, Media Relations Specialist at NASA.

“While we do not anticipate setbacks,” Potter adds, “we are prepared to deal with any that may arise by working strategically with our partners to find solutions to ensure we meet our end goals.”

Crew will ultimately fly to the Moon in the Orion capsule, which will perch atop the Space Launch System (SLS). An uncrewed flight of the Orion capsule was tested aboard the Delta IV Heavy rocket in 2014. The SLS is still under development and should make its maiden voyage — still uncrewed — in 2020. The first crewed flight with Orion atop the SLS, carrying four astronauts is currently set for 2022.

The first few Artemis missions will begin construction of a space station in cislunar orbit. If all goes according to plan, by 2024 a team of astronauts will fly to that space station, then touch down on the lunar surface.

Destination: Gateway

While NASA's current goal is to bring astronauts on the Moon by 2024, that's not the finish line. The lunar station, known as the Gateway, may also serve as a launch point for deep space missions, carrying astronauts to Mars and beyond. Potter told Sky & Telescope, “NASA has been studying the architecture needed to get us back to the Moon for a long time, and we will use the systems and technology we test and develop at the Moon for exploration farther into the solar system, including Mars.”

The Gateway will be a fraction of the size of the International Space Station that orbits our home planet. While the ISS is 109 meters long and 73 meters wide — about the size of an American football field — the Gateway will be much smaller, only 35 meters long and 5 meters wide.

However, that doesn’t mean it has a small role to play. As part of Artemis Phase 1 — getting astronauts to the moon by 2024 — the Gateway will provide a waystation for the astronauts when they arrive in orbit around our closest neighbor. The Artemis crew will consist of four astronauts, two descending to the lunar surface and two remaining on the Gateway. The station's minimal life support functions won’t be able to handle much more than that, at least to start.

Plus, there’s more in store for Phase 2, which includes setting up our permanent presence on the moon by 2028. “An expanded Gateway developed in Phase 2 could also function as a deep space laboratory for international collaboration, lunar science and technology advancement,” Potter notes.

We'll have to wait and see whether NASA can stick to the deadlines given the funding provided.

Right to the Moon

We've come a long way since Neil Armstrong first walked on the Moon. To put it all in perspective, the Apollo Guidance Computer had less memory than a modern-day calculator. Traveling to the Moon today with Apollo-era technology would be like trying to play Fortnite with your electric toothbrush. As we celebrate Apollo 11's 50th anniversary, it's good to look back on what we’ve learned, as well as look forward toward what else we can do. Even if we don't make it back to the moon by 2024, we're still heading in the right direction.

Happy 50th anniversary, Apollo, and thank you for everything you've taught us."
DHS warns of Russian efforts to divide America over pineapple pizza -- sort of,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-warns-russian-efforts-divide-america-pineapple-pizza/story?id=64444702,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is warning that Russian agents could seek to further divide Americans by exploiting U.S. passions over whether pineapple belongs on pizza.

Interested in Russia? Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

It's a cheesy, playful warning -- but it's trying to deliver a serious message. Posted online Wednesday by the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the tongue-in-cheek warning aims to help Americans identify and protect against propaganda campaigns from Russia and other foreign adversaries.

After all, the DHS warning says, Russian agents are capable of simultaneously insisting online that ""Being anti-pineapple is un-American!"" while also pushing out posts saying ""Millennials are ruining pizza!""

""Foreign influencers are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to inflame hot button issues in the United States,"" the new DHS warning says. ""They don’t do this to win arguments; they want to see us divided.""

According to the warning, foreign interference usually follows certain patterns.

First, foreign agents identify a divisive issue to target -- though likely not an issue as silly as whether pineapple is an appropriate pizza topping.

""No matter how you slice it, Americans disagree on the fruit topping,"" the DHS document notes with a pun.

Department of Homeland Security

After targeting a controversial issue, foreign agents then make sure social media accounts are in place, often reusing or renaming accounts ""to pollute those debates with bad information and make our positions more extreme by picking fights, or 'trolling' people online,"" according to the DHS warning.

The ""most extreme version of arguments on both sides of an issue"" often then become framed ""as legitimate information sources,"" pushing them ""into the mainstream"" and carrying them to larger audiences, the DHS warning says.

The final step of foreign interference is for agents to take what started in cyberspace and turn it into something ""very real, with Americans shouting down Americans because of foreign interference,"" DHS warns.

""In the past, Kremlin agents have organized or funded protests to further stoke divisions among Americans. They create event pages and ask followers to come out,"" according to DHS.

DHS offered this example: If the ""war on pineapple"" was a more serious issue, a foreign agent might tell unwitting followers to ""JOIN YOUR FELLOW PIZZA LOVERS AT THE TOWN CENTER TO MARCH FOR PINEAPPLE!""

Nevertheless, in its warning on Wednesday, DHS made clear -- in jest -- that: ""To date, we have no evidence of Russia (or any nation) actively carrying out information operations against pizza toppings.""

Russia's wide-ranging interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, from stealing and releasing thousands of Democratic National Committee emails to waging disinformation campaigns online, has U.S. authorities bracing for what could happen in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

Russian President Vladimir Putin not only wants to ""weaken"" the United States in the years ahead, but he also wants to keep his grip on power, according to Suzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at DHS who helped lead U.S. efforts to mitigate Russian cyber operations.

""He doesn't want [Russian citizens] to see ... the United States and liberal democracy as something they should long for. So what he wants to portray to them is democracy in chaos,"" Spaulding said Friday at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado.

And when it comes to cyber-operations against foreign adversaries, Russia ""is practicing jiu jitsu,"" trying to use the First Amendment and American free speech ""against us,"" Spaulding said.

A DHS spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment for this article."
"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has failed to bring 'swagger' back to the State Department and America is paying the price,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Brett Bruen'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-hasnt-restored-state-department-opinion-2019-7,"He came in promising to restore some swagger to the step of America's diplomats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spent a lot of time on swagger, his own. Little effort has been made to lift up others.

Our country's first line of defense at outposts around the world remains dangerously diminished and damaged. Even more concerning for our national security, such arrogance and ambition have proven quite costly for our influence abroad.

When Pompeo came on board, replacing the former Texas oil executive Rex Tillerson, the State Department was still suffering from a condition I call: Post-Tillerson Stress Disorder.

The Texas oil executive's management reforms wreaked havoc through the halls of the Harry S. Truman Building. So even though Pompeo was a former congressman from the outer extremities of the political spectrum, he was still seen as an improvement.

Pompeo promised to lift the debilitating hiring freeze and look after his people. A new ""professional ethos"" was written up, emphasizing respect and integrity. Unlike his predecessor, Pompeo spent time with families when he visited embassies. Just the fact that he held meetings and traveled regularly was an improvement.

Sure, his constant talk about swagger seemed a bit silly at first. But, my former colleagues told me, ""At least he will put us back at the big-kids table."" Many believed his promises of renewed hiring, reversing deep cuts to programs, and providing some modicum of support for those who serve.

The hiring hasn't gotten back to prior levels. Budgets continue to be slashed. Worst of all, Foreign Service families aren't getting the help they desperately need.

The State Department has not provided ongoing care for those injured by the serious sonic attacks in Cuba and China. Pompeo has also callously chosen not to restore funding for the care required for children of diplomats with special needs.

Then came the shutdown. That was the moment he really lost support, according numerous current diplomats with whom I remain in contact. They were so outraged we organized a call with journalists to shed light on their predicament, an unprecedented move for the normally press-shy diplomatic corps.

Americans serving overseas with their families bore some of the worst impacts from the extended period without pay. Unlike federal workers in the US, diplomats posted abroad could not pick up gigs on the local market. They don't have a support network of friends and family nearby. They wanted to hear their secretary at least acknowledge their predicament.

Instead, Pompeo ignored their plight. Making matters worse, he chose to bring his wife on a several-nation trip at the height of the shutdown. He even asked American diplomats working without pay to staff his wife, possibly in violation of federal regulations.

My former colleagues told me they were absolutely livid. It was an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on those serving abroad.

Then come the policy problems. Pompeo has by most measures mismanaged the North Korea account, failing to win Pyongyang's trust and teeing up solutions for three presidential-level engagements. The coalition to support a tougher stand on Iran has failed to materialize. Pompeo's aggressive saber-rattling on Venezuela was unhelpful.

Without question, selling Trump's policies can be a tall order. But his predecessors Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice managed to apply some delicate diplomacy to navigate turbulent waters in the wake of former President George W. Bush's deeply unpopular decisions, from Guantanamo to Iraq. This balancing act seems to be absent from Pompeo's State Department.

It's easy to dismiss the bombastic Pompeo as a natural byproduct of the Trump era. But bear in mind he is now what passes for a brake on bad ideas in the cabinet. He is literally what stands between us and another unwise war.

The trouble with swagger is that it soon wears off. It also really wears on people, when not grounded in substance.

America is paying a high price for the pompousness of Pompeo. Many foreign leaders have just stopped listening to him. Turkey's recent acquisition of a Russian missile system is just the latest example.

From what I hear, a good portion of his own department has lost confidence in his leadership. Career employees continue to flee, including a more than 30% decline in the percentage of senior Foreign Service executives who are African American, according to a recent report.

Lastly, despite all the bravado, the secretary has yet to deliver a single major foreign-policy victory for the administration. I think it's beyond time to dial back on the arrogance. He would be well served to channel President Teddy Roosevelt's advice of speaking softly while carrying a big stick.

Brett Bruen was the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat. He now runs the crisis-communications agency the Global Situation Room and teaches crisis management at Georgetown."
Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

Rep. Mark Walker: Border tour confirmed federal agents 'working their rear ends off',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rep-mark-walker-border-tour-confirmed-federal-agents-working-their-rear-ends-off,"SAN DIEGO, California — A senior House Republican who visited several federal immigration facilities in the country’s busiest region for illegal border crossings Friday described the congressional visit as a “reality check” for how federal agents and law enforcement partners are “working their rear ends off” despite Democrats' claims otherwise.

Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina and a bipartisan group toured three Customs and Border Protection facilities and one Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement holding facility in McAllen, Texas, and Donna, Texas. He said he witnessed federal agents stepping up to care for those in custody despite it being something “that’s not part of their job description.”

“It’s really a reality check for anybody to get up there and espouse this isn’t a crisis, like the Democrats did six months ago,” Walker, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security. Facilitation, and Operations, told the Washington Examiner over the phone Friday evening. “These Border Patrol agents are working their rear ends off with a level of professional service that’s rarely seen and anybody that would say otherwise would be disingenuous.”

Subcommittee Chairwoman Kathleen Rice said ahead of the trip that lawmakers were going down to South Texas to investigate the “inhumane treatment and conditions that migrants have endured.” A group of nine House members, including seven Democrats and two Republicans, took part Friday and visited the Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, Border Patrol Donna Station, Hidalgo Port of Entry, and an HHS facility that holds unaccompanied migrant children.

Since Oct. 1, 2018, this specific region of the border, one of Border Patrol’s nine sectors, has seen 289,000 people come through its facilities.

Walker said at one Border Patrol facility he saw a room packed full of diapers, clothing, food, and other resources, an indication the agency had the means on site to meet people’s needs. Congress recently passed $4.6 billion in supplemental funding for the humanitarian and security crisis along the southern border, where double the number of people have been encountered in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as the same point last year.

“It’s like if a thousand people showed up at your house this week. You would do everything you can do to provide the care and quality you can but before you get any assistance, it’s overwhelming. And that’s what we’re looking at here,” he said.

Some Democrats have condemned the 73 Border Patrol stations along the southern border as ""concentration camps."" Democratic senators who traveled to detention facilities in McAllen, Texas, on Friday provided a very negative account of the conditions they witnessed. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the conditions as “inhumane.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told lawmakers during a House hearing earlier this week massive numbers of people are being held in CBP custody because Democrats will not provide additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is where Border Patrol is supposed to transfer people to after initially taking them in and conducting interviews.

Walker said he learned more than half of all in custody were under the age of 18 compared to 2014 when just 1% of detainees were minors. In addition to children and families, he said he learned adults from countries including Pakistan and China were being taken into custody after having paid upwards of $30,000 to get smuggled into the U.S.

Walker, a former pastor in Greensboro, North Carolina, said he looks at those in custody with a “compassion perspective.”

“These are human beings. These people were created. And in my faith, I know God loves these people as much as he loves me,” he said. “But this immigration system is taking in one million immigrants over the last two years … these Border Patrol agents are not being able to secure either border with the amount of drugs and trafficking because of the influx.”

Scalia led the charge against a proposed rule that would have required 401(k) plan managers to act in the best interests of their investors.

He also worked to weaken parts of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill and Clinton-era rules designed to prevent repetitive stress injuries at work.



President Donald Trump's move this week to tap attorney Eugene Scalia to head the U.S. Department of Labor is causing worker advocates to sound the alarm. Scalia, whose father is late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is a career corporate lawyer most of whose professional life has focused on representing big companies in their fights with consumers, employees or government regulators.

The National Employment Law Project noted that Scalia ""has spent his entire career fighting for big businesses and against working people,"" while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute called Mr. Trump's choice ""another fox-guarding-the-hen house selection that defines the Trump cabinet."" And prominent Senate Democrats have stated their opposition to Scalia's nomination.

Coming from a White House avowedly in favor of eliminating a host of government regulations, Scalia's nomination is no great surprise. But what does that actually mean for U.S. workers?

Legal winners and losers

""Labor secretaries have a lot of power when it comes to enforcement,"" said Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. ""The labor secretary has tremendous influence on how the law is enforced, whether the law is enforced, which laws are favored and which laws aren't,"" she said.

Some states are raising the minimum wage because Congress won't

Take overtime work. Currently, an employer can avoid paying an employee one-and-a-half times their hourly pay by classifying that worker as a manager, unless that worker earns under $23,660 annually. For the last five years, the Labor Department has been working to raise the pay level at which workers draw overtime rates, with the exact pay thresholds changing depending on the administration. (President Obama's labor department aimed for a level of $47,700; the current proposed rule puts it at $35,300.)

""Glorified internships""

One area worker advocates are concerned about is apprenticeships. Mr. Trump made these programs a cornerstone of his economic policy when he was inaugurated, but two and a half years later, the program has barely gotten off the ground. ""Not a single apprenticeship program has been created under the program, nor a single person trained,"" Politico reported.

One way to speed that up that the government has proposed is by creating more industry-sponsored apprenticeships and curtailing the need for Labor Department approval. Currently, the government certifies the training programs to make sure they meet standards of pay, training and minimal benefits.

""These have been the hallmark of post-secondary education for people who are not interested in getting or can't get a bachelor's degree,"" Schurman said. Without certification, ""I predict that the apprenticeship would simply become just another form of glorified internship.""

President Trump signs executive order on apprenticeship programs

Tip pools and safety rules

Scalia's biography on the website of law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he is a partner, offers hints of what laws might fall out of favor if he were confirmed. For example, he has represented Walmart and other large employers in opposing a law requiring the businesses to spend a certain portion of their payroll on health care, and in another case against corporate whistleblowers who say they were fired.

After an orca at SeaWorld killed its trainer in 2010, meanwhile, Scalia defended the amusement park against new federal safety rules, arguing that ""the company has no more responsibility to protect its trainers than the NFL has a duty to combat on-the-field injuries,"" according to Mother Jones. Scalia also represented casino Wynn Las Vegas in a case that found that a business can force employees to share their tips with a pool of workers that the employer chooses.

In the 1990s, Scalia led the opposition to federal regulation that aimed to ensure better physical working conditions for employees. The so-called ergonomics rule required employers to warn their workers about repetitive stress injuries and to fix workplace conditions that led to frequent injuries. Scalia argued that the rule was based on ""junk science"" and ""quackery,"" writing in an op-ed that it would ""force companies to give more rest periods, slow the pace of work and then hire more workers.""

Dollars and cents

Several news reports have noted Scalia's zeal as a litigator, including a Bloomberg profile that appeared halfway through the Obama presidency. ""Suing the Government? Call Scalia!"" stated the piece, which detailed his role in blunting the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that followed the housing bust.

How Dodd-Frank changed Wall Street

""He was at the center of the industry effort to undo Dodd-Frank in the back rooms, and in terms of intimidating regulators and overturning important parts of it, he had a lot of success,"" recalled Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports the law.

""Most of the rules that were costing industry a lot of money, he was the lead on trying to overturn them,"" Stanley added.

Scalia also led the charge to roll back the so-called fiduciary standard. That rule, which originated at the Labor Department, would have required managers of a 401(k) to act in the best interests of their clients, instead of steering them into higher-fee funds that are more profitable for the fund managers.

With the fiduciary rule now repealed, middle-class investors are left with little guidance on their 401(k)s except ""buyer beware."" With many other rules potentially on their way out, the new advice could be: Beware of the boss."
Ellucian Banner security flaw highlighted by Education Department,https://www.insidehighered.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/19/ellucian-banner-security-flaw-highlighted-education-department,"The U.S. Department of Education has warned of “active and ongoing exploitation” of a security flaw in Ellucian’s Banner system that may have given hackers access to student data such as grades, financial information and Social Security numbers.

A security alert, published Wednesday by the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, said 62 colleges and universities using Banner had already been targeted. The alert indicates that criminals have been “scanning the internet looking for institutions to victimize” and drawing up lists of colleges to target.

Institutions that have transitioned to Banner 9, the latest version of Ellucian’s enterprise resource planning system, are not thought to be affected. But users using older versions of two Banner modules called Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services could be vulnerable.

According to Ellucian’s website, more than 1,400 institutions worldwide use Banner to manage student grades, staff payrolls, course schedules, admissions and student financial aid, among other tasks. Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services can be used by system administrators to get access to sensitive data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The student aid office encouraged institutions that have not recently upgraded Web Tailor or Enterprise Identity Services to do so and to contact the FSA incident team to determine whether there has been a data breach. Ellucian published a patch on May 14 that fixed the security flaw but has not shared how many institutions have installed it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology described the Banner security flaw as an “improper authentication vulnerability” that enabled attackers to take over users' sessions when they attempted to log in. Depending on the administrative privileges of the user, and the way data are organized by individual institutions, attackers could use this access to move laterally through administrative systems and access sensitive information. Attackers could also potentially manipulate this information, perhaps changing personal information or grades, dropping students from their courses or denying them student financial aid.

According to FSA, affected institutions reported that attackers used the security flaw to manipulate admissions and enrollment systems and create thousands of fake student accounts over the space of a few days. “Some of these accounts appear to be leveraged almost immediately for criminal activity,” the office said.

Josh Sosnin, chief information security officer at Ellucian, said in an emailed statement that there is no connection between the security flaw and the generation of the fake student accounts. “Ellucian has confirmed internally that the two issues outlined in the Department of Education report are separate, unrelated issues,” he said. “There is no connection between these two issues and Ellucian has communicated this to the Department of Education.”

If your campus uses Banner/Ellucian as a SIS, I hope you install updates in a timely manner. So far 62 campuses have reported they were affected by exploitation of a vulnerability in the product by ""criminal elements."" Patch was released May 14. #emchat https://t.co/SwIkZvdZaN — Dr. Liz Gross (@lizgross144) July 18, 2019

Institutions being targeted by bots that submit fraudulent admissions applications are “an industry issue and not specific to Ellucian or Banner,” said Sosnin. He added that Ellucian’s customer service employees are “standing by to help” customers with questions about patches or updates.

Why the FSA office is reporting on the Banner security flaw two months after it was patched by Ellucian is unclear. It is also not clear how the flaw was discovered, though the NIST advisory links to a document suggesting that it may have been identified as early as December 2018 by Joshua Mulliken, a member of IT staff at the University of South Carolina.

In a GitHub post, Mulliken outlines a “disclosure timeline” indicating that Ellucian took several months to address his concerns. Mulliken said via email that he was the first person to identify the security flaw.

""Ellucian has not been proactive in ensuring that its customers understand the seriousness of CVE-2019-8978,"" said Mulliken. ""Several institutions have reached out to me today and informed me that the had deferred updating for some time. The official messaging was not able to convey the urgency required, which more than likely contributed to the current situation.""

Scott Shackelford, professor of law and cybersecurity program chair at Indiana University at Bloomington, said it is not uncommon for organizations to take several months to release patches addressing security issues, particularly if they “don’t think it’s particularly troublesome.”

Moving forward, Shackelford encouraged colleges and universities to pay attention when companies release updates and install them “as quickly as possible.”

“This really boils down to basic cyberhygiene,” he said. He encouraged institutions to limit the number of users with administrative privileges for Banner and other enterprise resource planning software.

Both Shackelford and Emory Roane, privacy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that tracks data breach disclosures and advocates for consumer data protection, said it could take weeks before more information about the data breach is made public.

Depending on where institutions are located and what type of data were affected, there are different reporting requirements for disclosing breaches, said Shackelford. In Georgia, for example, there is no state-enforced timeline for reporting data breaches, he said. Roane would like to see that change -- he thinks the U.S. should move closer to Europe’s 72-hour disclosure requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Without disclosures, it is difficult to determine how serious the Banner data breaches are, said Shackelford.

Charlie Moran, senior partner and CEO of Moran Technology Consulting, described the breach as “bad, but only for a small number of schools.”

Most of the 1,400 institutions using Banner have already made the transition to Banner 9 modules, said Moran. “Most schools moved to Banner 9 this past year in a forced march because of a major software change that Ellucian was forced to make, so there are not a lot of schools running this old software,” he said."
Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as weapons of mass destruction.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."
Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions?source=politics&via=rss,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"

The forum took place one day after Argentina marked the 25th anniversary of the Argentine-Israelite Mutual Association bombing by designating Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization. The assembled diplomats built on that designation Friday by unveiling a “regional security mechanism” in which the United States and three regional allies will crackdown on Hezbollah’s money-laundering and cooperation with transnational drug cartels.

“The terrorist threat is something that affects all of us,” Argentinean Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie told reporters. “And we have to work very hard in Latin America to fund the financing that these organizations receive, and we know that there are some terrorist organizations that help recruit people and they look for financing in our area.”

The Argentinean envoy announced that Brazil and Paraguay would also partner in that effort, while the broader Western Hemisphere counterterrorism ministerial will reconvene in Colombia in January.

“It matters whether the U.S. can move the dial and thwart Iranian-backed penetration in our backyard,” Toby Dershowitz, a senior vice president at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner. ""This may be the year that serves as a wake-up call for others in the region impacted adversely by Hezbollah’s malign activities — including but not limited to money laundering and narco-terrorism.”

Faurie emphasized that Hezbollah has formed ties with historically communist terrorist groups in Peru and Colombia: the Shining Path and the ELN, respectively. Those allegations dovetailed with U.S. complaints that Iranian proxies are working with Venezuelan drug traffickers, with the approval of strongman Nicolás Maduro's regime, to finance terrorism in the Middle East.

“The countries of the region agreed, most of us, on the danger of Hezbollah to our hemisphere,” he said. “The linkage of these groups to Hezbollah make this relationship so much deeper because they look for funding and recruit people.”

Those denunciations were a diplomatic win for Pompeo, who has been trying to rally international pressure on Iran in the year since President Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal.

“We have many nations around the world now speaking the truth about the Islamic Republic of Iran, about its global campaign of terror and the malign activity that it has taken around the world,” Pompeo told reporters."
Prosecutors weighed DOJ policy blocking indictment of a sitting president in closing Trump hush-money probe,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Kristine Phillips', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/18/justice-department-weighed-rule-not-charging-president-ending-trump-hush-money-case/1769339001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors' decision to end an investigation into hush money payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump relied at least in part on long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The Justice Department told a federal judge on Monday that it had ""effectively concluded"" its investigation into efforts to silence the women in the final months of the 2016 campaign, but did not explain why it had done so. Prosecutors have said the payoffs violated a federal law that restricts campaign donations.

A person familiar with the case, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said it was unclear whether prosecutors made a determination that they had sufficient evidence to bring a case against Trump or anyone other than his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year. But the Justice Department's opinion that a president cannot be indicted factored into the decision to end the probe, the person said.

Federal prosecutors had repeatedly placed Trump at the center of the effort to silence pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the chaotic run-up to the 2016 election. Last year, they alleged in a court filing that Cohen had orchestrated illegal hush-money payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. And it revealed in unsealed court records on Friday that Trump participated in phone calls about the payments to Daniels.

The judgment by federal prosecutors in New York to take no further action in the wide-ranging inquiry tracks a decision earlier this year by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who cited the same Justice Department policy when he declined to make a determination about whether Trump's efforts to derail that investigation amounted to a crime.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2000 that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution."" That view has never been tested in court but is binding on federal prosecutors.

As in the Mueller inquiry, which outlined 10 instances in which Trump sought to thwart the special counsel's inquiry, documents revealed Thursday put then-candidate Trump in middle of a frantic effort to fend off damaging disclosures about his personal conduct just a month before the 2016 election.

In the documents, the FBI described a series of conversations in the days after a leaked Access Hollywood outtake showed Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals about preventing Daniels from airing her own claims of having had an affair with Trump years earlier.

Authorities laid out a timeline of emails, text messages and phone calls – some involving Trump himself – that ""concerned the need to prevent"" Daniels from going public with her story.

Trump denied knowledge of the payments after they became public. But the FBI told a judge it had obtained telephone records showing he participated in some of the first conversations about the scheme, which prosecutors have said violated federal campaign finance laws.

Federal prosecutors said in court filings last year that Cohen orchestrated payments to Daniels and McDougal, ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. The documents unsealed Thursday offer the first clear account of the extent of Trump's involvement in that effort, as the Republican nominee's campaign floundered just weeks before the election.

Ultimately, it was Cohen – not Trump – who was charged and convicted for the scheme. He is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison related to tax evasion and the hush-money scheme that amounted to illegal campaign finance violations. He also pleaded guilty to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

""Cohen's commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,"" prosecutors asserted prior to Cohen's sentencing.

In the same document, however, prosecutors indicated that Cohen was acting on behalf of Trump who they then-described in gauzy law enforcement vernacular as ""Individual 1.""

""The investigation is over,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Thursday. He declined to address whether the current Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president blocked any further action contemplated by New York prosecutors.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

But from a federal prison in upstate New York, Cohen continued to claim that his conviction should not mark the end of an investigation that has long shadowed the White House.

""I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment,” Cohen said in a statement Thursday. “The conclusion of the investigation exonerating The Trump Organization's role should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and the Department of Justice.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the unsealed documents bolstered Cohen's assertions.

""The inescapable conclusion from all of the public materials available now is that there was ample evidence to charge Donald Trump with the same criminal election law violations for which Michael Cohen pled guilty,"" Schiff said.

Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
"House votes to hold Attorney General Barr, Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoena on 2020 Census",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-to-vote-to-hold-barr-ross-in-contempt-over-2020-census-citizenship-question/2019/07/17/8dbeb35c-a89c-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html,"President Trump, joined by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, left, and Attorney General William Barr, speaks during an event at the White House on July 11, 2019. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.

The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.

After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.

But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.

“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.

In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”

“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.

Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”

The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.

During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.

“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.

Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.

Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”

“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.

Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.

“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”

Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.

In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”

“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.

In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.

“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats. “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”

Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.

A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels.

Oakland’s lawyers believe DOJ got involved in suit against NFL for political reasons,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com,['Posted Mike Florio'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/19/oaklands-lawyers-believe-doj-got-involved-in-suit-against-nfl-for-political-reasons/,"Getty Images

The Trump administration is possibly trying to help the NFL. Or, possibly, it’s trying to hurt Oakland.

Daniel Kaplan of TheAthletic.com reports that there’s a belief within the city’s legal team that the Department of Justice has butted in to the antitrust lawsuit challenging the relocation of the Raiders as retaliation against Oakland for Major Libby Schaaf’s criticism of President Trump.

“Oakland is not this particular administration or this president’s favorite city,” an unnamed source close to the city’s legal team told Kaplan. “And the mayor has been outspoken in her criticism of the current administration. But [it] wouldn’t surprise me that that was a factor.”

The DOJ filed a “statement of interest” arguing that Oakland can’t recover lost tax revenues and lease revenues through the antitrust lawsuit. If accepted, the argument wouldn’t kill the case, but it would limit the potential recovery.

“The reason why it’s kind of bizarre is that this little argument they make is really not particularly substantive; it doesn’t get rid of the case,” the unnamed source tells Kaplan. “So you wonder why, other than for political reasons, why would they file something that’s so totally stupid?”

I’m personally more inclined to think — and this is speculation, but when has that ever stopped me? — that it’s not an attack on Oakland but a favor to the NFL, which would further confirm the notion (partly speculation, partly informed) that something significant has happened behind the scenes to dramatically reverse the relationship of antagonism that existed between the President and the NFL.

From complaints about the concussion rules to taking credit for the league’s dramatic dip in ratings to a profane attack at an Alabama rally against players who protest during the playing of the national anthem to relentless criticism of the league’s handling of its anthem policy, President Trump was a major thorn in the league’s side until he suddenly wasn’t, dropping a low-hanging red-meat issue that would have been very easy to keep raising through the mid-term elections, and beyond.

So, yes, something happened. Maybe it was as simple as the public “thank you” from Commissioner Roger Goodell to the President regarding a fairly obscure business issue in Canada."

The Trump administration cannot point to another example of a treasury secretary intervening in a congressional request to release taxpayers returns, according to a Treasury Department letter released by a Democratic senator on Thursday.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly blocked House lawmakers’ demands that the Internal Revenue Service turn over six years of President Trump’s personal and financial tax returns, a battle that is headed to federal court.

Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, received the Treasury memo after blocking the president’s nominees to the department because it was not answering his questions about the fight over the president’s tax returns.

[House Democrats sue Trump administration over president’s tax returns]

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has demanded Trump’s returns under Section 6103(f) of the tax code, which states that the treasury secretary “shall furnish” tax returns requested by certain congressional bodies.

“We are not aware of whether a previous Treasury Secretary has directly responded to a section 6103(f) request before,” states the four-page memo, written by Justin W. Sok, senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs.

But Treasury’s memo also argues that the administration is also unaware of any other requests for tax records that elicited strong objections from the chair of the Finance Committee, a position held by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa.), or “presented such serious constitutional questions” as the one by House Democrats.

The memo may give ammunition to Democrats who have contended that Mnuchin has gone to extraordinary lengths to shield Trump’s personal financial records.

It also says the Trump administration cannot cite a prior instance in which the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel weighed in on a congressional request for private tax returns, although in at least one instance the OLC has given advice on congressional access to tax returns related to a subcommittee request. OLC provided an opinion to Mnuchin that has formed the basis for his denial of the records.

In a statement, Wyden said the letter “confirms that the Treasury Department has diverged from standard procedures in this case,” arguing that it reveals the “unprecedented process” by which the requests for Trump’s returns have been denied. Wyden said he will now allow the president’s nominations to the department to proceed through the Senate.

House Democrats filed a lawsuit earlier in federal court seeking access to Trump’s tax returns, accusing the administration of an “extraordinary attack” on Congress in preventing the disclosure of his records.

Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign in a break with decades of precedent. He has told advisers that he is willing to take the fight to the Supreme Court. He has publicly argued that the tax returns were an issue in the 2016 election but that they should no longer be of concern because he won.

Democrats have cited both the law and an internal IRS memo that says Congress must be given the returns unless the president invokes executive privilege, which he has not.

But in its June memo, the Treasury Department argues that the Democrats’ request for Trump’s returns are unlike any other prior request.

“The vast majority of disclosures to congressional committees under section 6103(f) consist of statistical studies, compilations, and other data products . . . provided for statistical purposes,” the Treasury memo states. “The requests for this information do not identify specific taxpayers.”

Steve Rosenthal, a legal expert at the Tax Policy Center, said the memo “confirms there has been a special process for reviewing requests related to President Trump.”

However, even some critics of Mnuchin’s decision say it is understandable that he played a role. “The conclusion Secretary Mnuchin reached is wrong. But, that said, I don’t think there’s anything wrong about the treasury secretary playing a role in the decision,” said Daniel Hemel, a legal expert at the University of Chicago."
Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers,https://thehill.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453893-science-committee-chair-threatens-epa-over-stonewalled-answers-to,"Rep.

Johnson said the EPA's failure to provide requested information to her committee represented an “obstruction of Congress,” and she threatened “compulsory measures” if it does not provide previously requested information by July and August deadlines.

“Over the past five months, EPA has stonewalled this Committee — preventing a coequal branch of government from conducting constitutionally-mandated oversight,"" Johnson wrote.

“I am deeply troubled by this lack of cooperation with our efforts to evaluate a program so vital to ensuring the health and safety of the American people, and this behavior fits into a disturbing pattern of obstruction and disrespect of Congressional authority.”

The EPA in a statement said the letter included a number of ""inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations."" It also said it had made efforts to send officials to the committee to answer its questions.

“The Committee’s letter includes a number of inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations, including that of the Agency’s interaction with the Committee and Committee staff,"" the statement from EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

""The Agency previously worked with the Committee to provide our top career science official within the Office of Research and Development to testify on the IRIS program.""

The IRIS program is the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, which is at the center of the panel's fight with the agency.

Lawmakers have put the chemical program under a microscope following reports that the agency suppressed a 2017 report outlining the health risks associated with formaldehyde. The program within the EPA is responsible for conducting many chemical risk assessment reports. These reports often underpin federal health protections.

Johnson’s committee has been pressing the EPA to explain why in December 2018 it removed formaldehyde and nine other chemical assessments from its program outlook.

“The agency has rebuffed the committee’s attempts to understand the prioritization process and how the benefits of eliminating several late-stage chemical assessments, including formaldehyde, outweigh the benefits,” Johnson wrote.

Johnson listed four instances where letters had been written to the EPA with questions or requests for briefings with agency officials, to little or no response.

She also cited the committee’s March 27 hearing on IRIS, where Kristina Thayer, the head of the program, was requested to testify. EPA instead sent another employee, Dr. Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who Johnson said was not involved in certain decisions the committee was keen to learn more about.

“At the hearing it became clear that Dr. Orme-Zavaleta was not involved in many of the decisions at the core of the committee’s investigation of the program, and she was not prepared by the agency to answer basic questions about relevant events about the past year,” Johnson wrote.

Abboud said Orme-Zavaleta was the EPA's science adviser and principal deputy assistant administrator, and ""was capable of adequately informing the Committee on the IRIS program and did so for as long as the Committee members had questions during the Committee’s March 27th hearing on the IRIS program.""

He accused panel members of mischaracterizing statements Orme-Zavaleta made in her testimony.

""As for the Committee’s repeated complaints this week about the Agency’s decision on who to provide on behalf of the EPA to testify, it is disappointing that the Committee refuses to acknowledge the extensive qualifications of Dr. Orme-Zavaleta and her ability to speak knowledgeably on all issues within her office and that the Committee continues to insist on dictating to the Agency who they believed is qualified to speak on issues, rather than agreeing to work with the Agency,"" Abboud said.

He added that Wheeler had agreed to testify in front of the committee on Sept. 19.

Johnson in her letter said EPA’s continued attempts to obfuscate details related to the IRIS program amounts to an “obstruction of Congress.”

She said the panel wanted by the end of the business day Friday one specific document related to IRIS.

“Your staff in congressional affairs has made every effort to obstruct the committee’s oversight, going so far as to attempt to change the substance of the record. At this point, the committee has exhausted all non-compulsory means of conducting oversight over EPA. The agency’s obstruction of Congress is particularly disturbing considering the implications of the matter at hand for children’s health,” she wrote."

Ocasio-Cortez confronted Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan about images of her ""violent rape"" from a secret Facebook group. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

EPA announces new program designed to clean up Great Lakes,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Mary Kilpatrick', 'Mkilpatrick Cleveland.Com']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2019/07/epa-announces-new-program-designed-to-clean-up-great-lakes.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Cleveland Friday to announce a new program designed to help remove trash from the Great Lakes and its shores.

The Trash-Free Great Lakes grant program will provide about $2 million in grants to clean up waste along Great Lakes beaches, shorelines, harbors and rivers. The money will also support trash and litter prevention efforts in the Great Lakes, as well as educational projects.

""We are here today because the health of the Great Lakes is a top priority for President Trump and his administration,” Wheeler said during a news conference along Lake Erie. “We are committed to protecting and restoring one of America’s greatest natural resources.”

The program is part of the EPA’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which the Trump administration proposed cutting from $300 million to $30 million earlier this year. The administration less than a month later reversed course and supported fully funding the GLRI.

State and local agencies, tribes and non-profits can begin applying for Trash-Free Great Lakes grants in October. Applicants will find out they received grants in February. The program could pay for up to 12 grants — potentially enough to support two large projects and 10 smaller projects. The program could award grants up to $500,000.

The lake’s annual harmful algal bloom is forecasted to be more severe than last year, but on par with 2017. The bloom affects Toledo to the islands, contaminating drinking water, and turning it pea green. The size of the annual spread depends on how much rain falls on Northeast Indiana, Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio between March and July and how much phosphorus runs off farms into the Maumee River which feeds into the lake.

Wheeler said the EPA has recently announced $14 million in grants to help reduce nutrients, which include phosphorus, in the Great Lakes.

“We also recognize that marine litter is just one of the challenges facing the future of the Great Lakes,” he said.

Before announcing the trash cleanup program, Wheeler joined U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, of Chagrin Falls, aboard the EPA’s largest research vessel, the Lake Guardian, and heard from scientists about their work studying the Great Lakes.

The EPA each year surveys all of the Great Lakes, once in the spring and once in the summer. In addition, the agency studies the dead zone in Lake Erie annually.

The agency also annually spends an intensive period studying one of the Great Lakes, rotating each year between each of the bodies of water. This year, it’s Lake Erie’s turn.

Wheeler and Joyce surveyed how the vessel sampled water and mud samples in Lake Erie. The scientists said they’ve seen areas in the lake that appear to have lots of mayfly boroughs, a positive indicator of the lake’s health. The officials also saw the equipment the scientists used to take photographs and film underwater, to see, for example, how many invasive mussel species there are. One instrument, a sled constructed using snow mobile parts, is dragged along the lake floor to take videos of the lake bottom.

Scientists are also studying naturally occurring manganese levels, a metal found in Lake Erie’s sentiment. The metal can unbind from sentiment in low oxygen areas, creating foul-smelling, yellow water, that’s expensive to treat. Scientists are trying to come up with a model to predict these spikes in manganese for water treatment plants.

Wheeler, an Ohio native and a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, remarked that he believes he’s the only EPA administrator to go swimming in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve been swimming in Lake Erie and I want to make sure that future generations can continue to go swimming in Lake Erie,” he said during the news conference."

Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/453525-treasury-department-bureaucrats-risk-jumpstarting-islamic-state,"It has now been 21 months since Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces and U.S. air support, moved into Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Earlier this month, I spoke at a Rojava Centre for Strategic Studies conference in Amudeh, Syria, exploring the Islamic State’s enablers, after which I had the opportunity to visit Raqqa as the local administration’s guest.

To enter Raqqa is to be overwhelmed by destruction. Thousands of former residents remain in tents at a camp alongside the road outside Ayn Issa. Most would like to return to their homes just 45 minutes’ drive away, but Raqqa remains largely destroyed. Driving into town requires passing the shells of apartment buildings stretching miles. Local authorities have given a face lift to Naim Square, where the Islamic State executed prisoners and mounted their heads, and rebranded it Freedom Square. The buildings facing the square, however, remain bombed out.

There are signs of life in the center of town: wedding dresses, children’s toys, and sweets sold in shops surrounded by rubble. Children played soccer in a stadium once used as the Islamic State’s chief prison. Graffiti on the stadium wall cursed the Islamic State and expressed love for Taylor Swift Taylor Alison SwiftPoll: Michelle Obama most admired woman in the world Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence Warren signs Taylor Swift's Equality Act petition MORE. Unexploded ordnance slows recovery, as workers clear rubble by hand, and tempers are short. The biggest obstacle to Raqqa’s recovery, however, lies in Washington rather than Syria: The U.S. Treasury Department has been sitting on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver for the Syrian Democratic Council for four years.

Opposition groups in Syria can be an alphabet soup of acronyms but, in short, the Syrian Democratic Council is the umbrella organization for pro-American Syrian Kurdish militias like the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the all-female Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

When I first visited northeastern Syria in January 2014, U.S. diplomats had refused to talk to the Syrian Kurdish opposition out of deference to Turkey. The United States reconsidered its position due to both Kurds’ effectiveness against the Islamic State and Turkey’s double-dealing on terrorism. The United States began talking to the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in December 2015, and almost immediately, the SDC applied for a U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver so that they could hire American companies to participate in reconstruction and so that they could spend their own money in the United States. The SDC does not ask for handouts: one of the biggest differences between my most recent trip and my first is that the oil derricks between Qamishli and the Tigris River are now operating but absent a waiver, the SDC cannot legally spend money in the United States or elsewhere.

It is unclear whether inertia or a misguided strategy motivates OFAC to sit for years on the pending SDC waiver: The group is pro-Western and cooperates closely with Washington. The Treasury Department previously granted the Syrian National Council, the political arm of the Free Syrian Army, a waiver even though extremists and terrorists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army. In contrast, U.S. military members in Syria trust the SDF more than local partners in Iraq or Afghanistan; there has not been a single instance of SDF men or women turning on American mentors.

The Treasury Department’s inaction not only handicaps diplomacy but also undercuts U.S. strategy.

Isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains a core U.S. interest. The Kurds dislike Assad: He voided citizenship papers Kurds need for school and employment, and imprisoned Kurdish activists. However, given Turkey’s support for Islamist radicals and its anti-Kurdish ethnic cleaning in areas of Syria the Turkish army occupies, Syrian Kurds fear Turkey more. Simply put, Treasury’s failure is pushing pro-American Kurds back toward Assad.

Numerous diplomats castigate the Iraqi government for its failure to reconstruct Mosul after it was damaged first by Islamic State conquest and then its liberation. Diplomats fear frustration could fuel Islamic State resurgence. The same is now true with Raqqa, where frustration is palpable. The only difference is that if Raqqa erupts, the blame will not be on a foreign government, but on the glacial pace of the U.S. government’s own bureaucracy.

Why the V.A. Won’t Pay for Service Dogs to Treat PTSD,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jasper Craven'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/service-dogs-veterans-ptsd.html,"[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more stories about veterans and V.A. policy.]

The V.A. is currently conducting research into the effectiveness of service dogs, but the process has been slow. Research started in 2011 was supposed to wrap up in 2015 but has repeatedly been stalled by problems with the study’s design and execution. In May, the V.A. said the findings of the study, which has cost $16 million to date, would be released to the public in 2020.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are growing impatient with what they perceive as a lack of initiative at a time when there is a growing mental-health crisis in America’s veterans community. In June, Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, reintroduced the PAWS Act, to establish a $10 million grant program through the V.A., which would give qualified nonprofit organizations up to $25,000 for each veteran they pair with a service dog. The stipend would cover the canine’s training, and the training of the recipient with his or her service dog. The bill is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, pitting lawmakers against the V.A., which is refusing to endorse any new stopgap service-dog program before its internal research is completed.

Stuck in the middle are the veterans themselves. Among those receiving disability benefits from the V.A., more than one in five suffers from PTSD. Veterans who have responded poorly to conventional treatments have had to improvise, sometimes by paying thousands of dollars up front to acquire service dogs, then covering the significant costs of feeding and caring for them. To make matters worse, veterans seeking service dogs without any support from the V.A. are forced to wade into a largely unregulated industry: Some end up with a dog that provides few benefits because it isn’t properly trained. Veterans advocates say access to a psychiatric service dog without the associated financial burden can’t come soon enough.

In January 2009, Al Franken, fresh off his winning campaign for a Senate seat, met Luis Montalván, a medically retired Army captain who had served two tours as an intelligence officer in Iraq, and his golden retriever named Tuesday. Montalván had returned home with a shattered leg, spinal damage, a brain injury and PTSD symptoms that included vivid nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks and a fear of public spaces. The only therapy that eased Montalván’s symptoms was Tuesday, whom he received from a group called Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities. Tuesday sensed if Montalván’s breathing sharpened or he began to perspire, and then intervened with a nuzzle. If Tuesday noticed Montalván thrashing while asleep in bed, he would wake the former soldier from his nightmare with a series of sloppy face-licks. Tuesday was even trained to direct the Army veteran from his bed to his pill bottles each morning."
Cummings asks if DOJ guidelines kept Trump from being prosecuted,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Kara Scannell']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/politics/cummings-cohen-trump-payments/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The House Oversight Committee is asking federal prosecutors in New York whether the Justice Department's policy against indicting a sitting President played any role in the decision not to indict President Donald Trump for his role in directing Michael Cohen to arrange hush-money payments to women alleging affairs during the 2016 campaign.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, sent a letter to Deputy US Attorney Audrey Strauss Friday after the Southern District of New York revealed in a letter Thursday they had it had concluded its investigation into whether anyone else would be charged in the campaign finance scheme that Cohen pleaded guilty to last year, which was one part of Cohen's three-year prison sentence he's now serving.

Federal search warrants released Thursday detailed how Trump and his allies scrambled in the final weeks of the campaign to arrange hush-money payments. The documents are the first time that federal authorities have identified Trump by name and spelled out in his involvement in the hush-money scheme.

""If prosecutors identified evidence of criminal conduct by Donald Trump while serving as President -- and did not bring charges as they would have for any other individual -- this would be the second time the President has not been held accountable for his actions due to his position,"" Cummings wrote. ""The Office of the President should not be used as a shield for criminal conduct.""

An spokesman from the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the letter. Sources have previously told CNN that as a part of the Justice Department, its prosecutors follow department guidelines.

"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

This article has been updated to note that only USDA would be impacted by the Senate legislation due to timing."
EPA worker rights under White House assault,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/453710-epa-worker-rights-under-white-house-assault,"Last week, the Trump administration executed another step in its plan to dismantle the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Step one was appointing agency leaders who don’t support EPA’s mission. Step two was throwing out rules designed to protect the public from pollution and from climate change. Now comes step three: stripping EPA employees of rights and unilaterally changing employment conditions that are essential to maintaining a functioning workplace.

While running for office in 2016, Donald Trump told Fox News that, if elected, he would dismantle EPA to the point where there would be only “little tidbits left.” Unless Congress steps in, this goal will soon be in sight.

On July 8 – the same day President Trump Donald John TrumpUS-Saudi Arabia policy needs a dose of 'realpolitik' Trump talks to Swedish leader about rapper A$AP Rocky, offers to vouch for his bail Matt Gaetz ahead of Mueller hearing: 'We are going to reelect the president' MORE gave a fantastical speech boasting of “incredible” environmental achievements – his administration announced it was throwing out years of past agreements between EPA management and our union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and imposing new workplace edicts on two-thirds of the workforce as AFGE represents nearly 8,000 EPA workers.

These new workplace rules, which were not negotiated with the union and not agreed to by employees, will have far-reaching consequences on employees and the work that they do.

For instance, the new directive nearly eliminates the option for most employees to work from alternative work locations closer to where they live. For an agency that is supposed to be committed to reducing carbon emissions, minimizing commutes for its own employees should be a high priority. Over the past decade, EPA has steadily increased the availability of telework to the point where many employees rely heavily on that option – not only to reduce commute times, but to balance childcare and other obligations. With that option yanked away, many employees will choose other employment alternatives – especially any that are closer to home.

Additionally, the unilateral directive denies workers due process by limiting workers’ access to grievance procedures and preventing union representatives from meeting with employees and managers to resolve disputes. Denying workers due process in this way creates an untenable work situation for employees.

In the Bay Area, this action initially and primarily hurts the staff-level attorneys who work at EPA’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office (EPA Region 9) in San Francisco and are members of AFGE Local 1236. They handle mission-critical cases that include cleaning up Superfund sites, pursuing clean air and clean water cases in court, prosecuting environmental crimes, cleaning up oil spills, enforcing hazardous waste and toxic substances laws, and much more – all to protect the American public and the environment from diverse and complex environmental burdens and disasters. And they have been doing this vital work despite severe staffing and budget cuts over the past several years.

Unfortunately, the administration’s attack on our workplace rights and protections isn’t isolated to EPA. At agency after agency – Education, Health and Human Services, Social Security, Veterans Affairs – political appointees are hijacking the collective bargaining process in an attempt to force through anti-worker provisions. Many of these proposals mirror those contained in three executive orders President Trump issued in May 2018 that were subsequently ruled illegal by a federal judge.

The administration’s rejection of labor rights is part of a broader effort to silence federal workers and gut workplace rights. It is precisely these benefits that make it possible for many of those employees to stay at the EPA, working toward a cleaner and safer environment for all of us.

If the administration succeeds in enforcing these anti-labor directives, EPA and other federal agencies will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining employees who perform critical services on behalf of our country. That is clearly the intent of the Trump administration, which sees federal employees as the enemy.

As employees leave the agency, most are never replaced, and access to clean air and clean water and safe places for our families to live and play will steadily dwindle. We all need to let our senators and congressional representatives know that we value the work of the EPA and other federal agencies and ask them to intervene before the damage that is being done to EPA and other agencies across the government becomes permanent.
