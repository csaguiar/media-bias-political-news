New York Times: Trump abruptly calls off military strikes against Iran after approving them,https://www.cnn.com,['Kate Sullivan'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-military-strikes-iran/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump abruptly called off military strikes against Iran on Thursday night after previously approving the strikes in retaliation for Iran shooting down a US military drone, The New York Times reports.

The operation was already underway in its initial stages -- ships were in position and planes were in the air -- but no missiles had been fired when the order came to stand down, a senior administration official told the Times. The strike had been scheduled for just before dawn on Friday in Iran to minimize the risk to civilians and the Iranian military, and military officials received word shortly after then that the strike was off, at least temporarily.

The United States remains locked in a standoff with Iran, with US military or diplomatic responses having the potential to provoke further escalation from Tehran. Iran's downing of a US drone earlier Thursday has left the President caught between Republicans demanding a response and congressional Democrats warning that Trump -- and the Iran policy hardliners on his national security staff, who welcome the confrontation -- could lose control of the situation and lead the US into war.

Military and diplomatic officials were expecting a strike as late as 7 p.m. on Thursday after intense debate among Trump's top national security officials and congressional leaders at the White House, multiple senior administration officials involved in or briefed on the deliberations told the Times.

Trump initially approved attacks on a handful of Iranian targets, like radar and missile batteries, and the Times reports it was not clear whether Trump simply changed his mind or whether his administration pulled back because of strategy or logistics. It was also not clear whether the attacks may still occur.

"In Rare Rebuke To Trump, Senate Votes To Block Saudi Arms Sales",https://www.npr.org,['Amy Held'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/20/734437874/in-rare-rebuke-to-trump-senate-votes-to-block-saudi-arms-sales,"In Rare Rebuke To Trump, Senate Votes To Block Saudi Arms Sales

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Amid rising tensions in the Middle East, the Senate voted to rein in President Trump's powers, passing three bipartisan resolutions on Thursday blocking the administration from selling billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia.

Seven Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, joined all Democrats in voting for the measures blocking against sales to Saudi Arabia, each passing 53-45.

With 22 separate sales pending, the other 20 resolutions involved arms sales to other allies, including the United Arab Emirates. They were voted on en bloc, whereby four Republicans joined the Democrats in that 51-45 vote.

While sending a strong signal to the administration, all three Senate votes failed to get enough votes to override a pledged veto by the president.

The House must now pass a joint resolution of disapproval, which would then go to the president's desk. It is also not expected to pass a veto.

Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., introduced the measures, citing Saudi Arabia's role in the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been engaged in a multi-year campaign against Houthi rebels, often with disastrous consequences for the civilian population.

""If the Senate wants to show the world that, even if you are an ally you cannot kill with impunity, this is the moment,"" Menendez said on the Senate floor.

But the White House said the U.S. has taken ""a number of actions to help the Saudi military mitigate the risk of civilian casualties in Yemen, including training and advising the Saudi military to help them improve their targeting processes to minimize civilian casualties.""

In a statement, the White House said halting the arms sales ""would send a message that the United States is abandoning its partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing.""

""Saudi Arabia serves as a bulwark against the malign activities of Iran and its proxies,"" the White House said, adding that the resolutions would affect the ability of American partners ""to deter and defend against Iran's hostile acts.""

The administration has said it has the authority to carry out the sales because of an ""emergency"" in the Gulf, citing Iran's aggression in the region. The White House declared the emergency and approved the weapons sales May 24, the same day it announced the deployment of 1,500 troops to the Gulf region.

Following last year's grisly slaying of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate, Congress has called for holding Saudi Arabia accountable, even as the administration has affirmed U.S.-Saudi ties.

Sen. Rand Paul, who was among the handful of Republicans who voted to ban the weapons sales, referenced Khashoggi on the Senate floor Thursday, saying ""there is high confidence that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia butchered a dissident with a bone saw ... You would think that would give us pause as to giving Saudi Arabia or selling Saudi Arabia more weapons.""

""We don't sell weapons to Russia. We don't sell weapons to China because we have disagreements and we don't think it would be in our best interest to sell them weapons,"" said Paul, calling Saudi Arabia itself, ""untrustworthy.""

Also Thursday, the Court of Appeals in the United Kingdom ruled British arm sales to Saudi Arabia for use in the Yemen War are unlawful.

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the government would suspend new sales while it looks into the implication of the ruling.

Hope Hicks says she told 'white lies' only about small matters,https://www.cnn.com,"['Marshall Cohen', 'Kaitlan Collins', 'Manu Raju', 'Jeremy Herb']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/hope-hicks-transcript-released/index.html,"(CNN) Former White House communications director Hope Hicks told lawmakers Wednesday that she had ""never been asked to lie about matters of substance or consequence,"" contending that ""white lies"" she had told on behalf of President Donald Trump were about small matters, such as his availability.

The comments are part of the 273-page transcript of Hicks' closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, a document that revealed behind-the-scenes details of Trump's presidential campaign as well as her relationship to the now-commander in chief.

Asked if Trump ever asked anyone to lie during the campaign, Hicks said: ""Not that I can recall.""

But the transcript also showed just how much White House lawyers objected to the questioning.

According to Democrats on the committee, attorneys from the Trump administration blocked Hicks from answering 155 questions. Democrats said Hicks was accompanied by her two private lawyers, as well as three lawyers from the White House and one lawyer from the Justice Department, who objected throughout the nearly eight-hour session to virtually every topic on her time in the White House.

The transcript shows how the Judiciary Committee is seeking -- so far unsuccessfully -- to put witnesses like Hicks on the record about the episodes that were detailed in the Mueller report. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler has not publicly said that he will pursue an impeachment inquiry, but answers to the questions posed and objected to Wednesday would likely form a base of evidence if the committee did pursue an impeachment path.

At the same time, there was little new unearthed during Wednesday's hearing, as Hicks and the other witnesses that Democrats are seeking to haul up to Capitol Hill have already testified before the special counsel, if not congressional committees, too.

The interview underscores the challenges Democrats face in swaying hardened public opinions about Russia, the president and obstruction and the findings of the report from special counsel Robert Mueller.

Hicks says Trump's 'Russia, if you're listening' line in July 2016 was a joke

Hicks told lawmakers she had spoken with Trump right after his infamous speech in July 2016 when he publicly called on the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's emails (The campaign later said this was a joke.)

""The discussion was me informing him that some in the media had taken the expression quite literally, and that they were concerned he was encouraging foreign governments to, you know, locate those emails, and that that was obviously something that the media felt was extremely inappropriate and demanded a response from Mr. Trump and the campaign as to what exactly he meant by that,"" she said.

In her testimony, Hicks maintained that the comment was ""a joke.""

""You know, it was my understanding from both the way he made the remark, and the discussions afterwards, that this was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,"" she said. ""This was not a comment that was intended as an instructive or a directive to a foreign government. It was a joke. And that was the intent, based on my conversation with him, and that was it.""

The Mueller report noted that ""Within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, GRU officers targeted for the first time Clinton's personal office."" GRU is the initials for Russia's military intelligence agency.

Trump Tower 2016

One strain of questioning led to an inconsistency with testimony from Mueller's report. Lawmakers asked Hicks about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where the campaign expected to receive dirt from Russian government that could help them defeat Hillary Clinton.

Trump and his team have repeatedly said that the only people who knew the details of the meeting as it happened were the people who were actually in the room: Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman at the time.

Hicks told lawmakers she learned about the meeting ""in June of 2017,"" which is consistent with her testimony to the special counsel. But that denial doesn't entirely line up with Mueller's findings. That report cited testimony from Manafort's deputy Rick Gates, who was described as a credible and reliable cooperating witness. He told investigators about a campaign strategy session, days before the meeting, where Trump Jr. announced that he had a lead on ""negative information"" about Clinton and that it was coming from a Kyrgyzstan. Gates recalled that Hicks was present for that session.

At times, Hicks said she had no recollection of key moments in the Mueller report.

When asked by Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island whether she had read Mueller report, Hicks responded ""No, sir. I lived the Mueller report.""

Hicks also told lawmakers she wasn't aware of any discussions about WikiLeaks within the Trump campaign, except for conversations about things that were already in the public domain.

""Sometimes there would be speculation about if there would be more emails or information released, but that was prompted by things in the media so -- and, obviously, it wasn't, you know, certain certainty. It was with speculation and skepticism,"" she said.

Hicks describes Trump order as 'odd'

There were also small snapshots of the relationship between Trump and Hicks, one of the first members of the President's inner circle to face a Democratic-led committee.

Hicks told lawmakers she has spoken to Trump only between five and 10 times since she left the administration in February 2018.

Hicks said she viewed Trump's order to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions to unrecuse himself from the Russia investigation as ""odd.""

Hicks said she would still have gone to work for the Trump team if she had known about ""the hell that (she) would be put through."" Responding to a question from Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, Hicks said ""I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity I had to serve, and, yes, I would do it all over again.""

Mark Levin: Stop blaming Trump for Iran,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mark-levin-stop-blaming-trump-for-iran,"""Life, Liberty & Levin"" host Mark Levin appeared on ""Hannity"" Thursday where he blasted Iran apologists in the media and defended National Security Advisor John Bolton.

""Stop apologizing for Iran. What I hear tonight and what I'm hearing throughout the day is a bunch of people who are embracing Jimmy Carter's foreign policy of appeasement, of distraction of excuses, of spin. You can embrace Jimmy Carter's foreign policy, a wild failure or you can embrace Ronald Reagan's foreign policy, a wild success,"" Levin told host Sean Hannity.

TRUMP SAYS IRAN’S US DRONE SHOOT-DOWN MAY HAVE BEEN ‘MISTAKE,’ BUT ‘COUNTRY WILL NOT STAND FOR IT’

Iran blasted a Navy high-altitude drone out of the sky over the Strait of Hormuz, with U.S. Central Command leaders on Thursday slamming the ""unprovoked"" strike and Tehran's subsequent ""false"" justifications for it.

Bolton has faced criticism and accusations of ""war mongering,"" with some believing he wants a conflict with Iran.

Levin defended Bolted calling the accusations a ""disgrace.""

""John Bolton hasn't done anything, he is a national security advisor and advises the president of the United States. I'm sure China and Russia and North Korea and Iran love it when they hear hosts and others trashing John Bolton,"" Levin said.

""Part of a massive propaganda efforts. The president of the United States is a strong leader, he will listen to advice from many people, he will make the decision. These attacks on Bolton, including leaks coming out of the White House are a disgrace, absolute disgrace.""

The radio host also went after those blaming President Trump for ""provoking"" Iran saying there is much ""evil"" in the world and the United States isn't part of it.

"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

The U.S. State Department Has 'Not Seen an Uptick' of Deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://people.com,['Steve Helling'],,,,https://people.com/crime/state-department-no-updick-deaths-dominican-republic/,"Image zoom Shutterstock

By now, the news is everywhere.

In the past year, according to the U.S. State Department, at least eight American tourists have died after falling ill in Dominican Republic resorts — and dozens more have gotten sick. The incidents have garnered widespread media coverage, causing many Americans to rethink their travel plans.

But despite the rash of illnesses, the U.S. State Department has not issued an elevated travel advisory for the island nation — and the agency says in a statement that they “have not seen an uptick” in deaths despite the media coverage.

“We are closely monitoring ongoing investigations by Dominican authorities into several recent deaths of U.S. citizens in the Dominican Republic,” the statement says. “We have no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad.”

“Millions of Americans travel to the Dominican Republic every year,” the statement continues. “Speaking generally, we have not seen an uptick in the number of US citizen deaths reported to the Department. While the overwhelming majority travel without incident, we want to assure all Americans that we continue to work actively with the Dominican authorities at the very highest levels to ensure that U.S. citizens are safe and feel safe while in the Dominican Republic.”

In April 2019, the department rated the Dominican Republic a level 2 for safety on a scale where 1 is the safest and 4 is the most dangerous. The rating means visitors should “exercise increased caution due to crime.” In the weeks of intense media scrutiny following the deaths of Americans, there has been no change to the rating.

The FBI has agents in on the island and are investigating the deaths of at least six of the tourists who have died since the summer of 2018. Some of them passed away in what appear to be bizarre — and similar — circumstances. The agencies are not yet releasing further details about the investigations.

Robin Bernstein, the ambassador of the United States to the Dominican Republic, told Univision these high-profile incidents should not be considered anything more than isolated cases. “We have 2.7 million Americans who come to the country and the statistics is that this is a very … unique event,” Bernstein said in a statement. “They come to visit the beautiful beaches and enjoy the great culture. Unfortunately sometimes those things happen to people.”

A spokesperson at the U.S. State Department tells PEOPLE that they will continue to monitor the situation, and will issue an elevated warning “if and when necessary.”"
E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Treasury bond yields are at the lowest level since 2016. Here's what that means,https://www.cnn.com,"['Anneken Tappe', 'Cnn Business']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/investing/10-year-treasury-yield/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Yields on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell to a two-and-a-half-year low Thursday morning after the Federal Reserve indicated multiple interest rate cuts could be coming soon.

Bond yields tend to fall when investors sense rate cuts are looming. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so if the price of a bond goes up, the yield goes down.

But Thursday's move is notable, because the last time the 10-year Treasury bond yielded less than 2% was in November 2016.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates nine times between late 2015 and late 2018, lifting yields on US government debt. The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3.2% in late 2018.

Since then, bond yields had been trending lower as investors sought safety amid a global economic slowdown.

— A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

>> Live Doppler 7 Radar

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
Justice Dept. lawyer suggests 'toothbrush and soap' not required for detained migrant kids,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/449506-justice-dept-lawyer-suggests-toothbrush-and-soap-not-required-for,"A Justice Department lawyer suggested at a recent hearing that a toothbrush and soap were not necessarily required to fulfill sanitary conditions for detained migrant children laid out in a years-old agreement, The Associated Press reports.

According to the news agency, Sarah Fabian, a senior litigation counsel for the department, made the suggestion while discussing a 1997 settlement agreement that requires certain sanitary and safety standards be met for detained persons during a recent hearing at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

ADVERTISEMENT

The hearing was centered around the government’s appeal of a ruling handed down by a federal judge in 2017 that found authorities violated the settlement after a group of detained migrant children reportedly said they were forced to sleep in inadequate conditions and not provided with sufficient food.

Fabian argued at the recent hearing that the agreement failed to provide specificity as to what items must be provided to ensure sanitary and safety conditions are met, including a toothbrush and soap.

“There’s fair reason to find those things may be part of safe and sanitary,” she said, according to the publication.

When pressed further by a judge about whether a toothbrush and soap should always be provided to detainees, Fabian reportedly said the items aren’t necessarily required depending on the person’s length of stay.

The government reportedly argues in its appeal that the 2017 ruling is based in “new substantive requirements” that aren’t outlined in the decades-old agreement between activists and the U.S. government.

However, activists say the settlement’s requirements that conditions in which detained migrant children be “safe and sanitary” extends to basic items maintaining personal hygiene, like a toothbrush and soap, according to The Associated Press."
DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

Kushner transactions part of DOJ money laundering probe at Deutsche Bank,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/19/kushner-transactions-part-of-doj-money-laundering-probe-at-deutsche-bank/,"The Justice Department has opened up a criminal investigation into potential money- laundering violations by Deutsche Bank — including transactions linked to President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to a report.

The DOJ is investigating why the bank didn’t alert the US Treasury to potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and the Kushner Cos. in 2016, including money to Russian individuals, according to the New York Times.

Investigators are looking into why the bank didn’t file alerts, known as Suspicious Activity Reports, even though compliance employees had prepared them, according to the report.

DOJ investigators are relying on information provided by Tammy McFadden, a whistleblower who helped prepare the reports. They have been talking to Val Broeksmit, the son of a banker who oversaw a unit of the bank that’s been troubled by money-laundering violations since before the 2016 Kushner transaction.

That banker, William Broeksmit, committed suicide in 2014 and was profiled in The Post’s award-winning video “The Banker Suicides” in 2016.

A spokeswoman for Kushner Cos. told the NYT the firm is not under investigation. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the company would cooperate with “authorized investigations.”"
"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

Trump EPA chief accuses California of bad faith in broken fuel efficiency talks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-epa-chief-accuses-california-of-bad-faith-in-broken-fuel-efficiency-talks,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler accused California’s top air pollution regulator Mary Nichols on Thursday of being ""unwilling to be a good faith negotiator"" over fuel efficiency standards that the Trump administration wants to roll back.

Wheeler said to Nichols, in a letter obtained by the Washington Examiner, that her claim that the oil industry swayed the proposed rollback ""is beneath the responsibilities of the substantial position she holds.""

Wheeler sent the letter ahead of a blockbuster hearing hosted by two House committees at which EPA’s office chief Bill Wehrum testified about the administration’s proposed weakening of Obama-era fuel efficiency rules. Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, is slated to testify on a separate panel Thursday afternoon.

Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the panels hosting the hearing, launched an investigation Wednesday into whether the oil and refinery industries influenced the proposed weakening of auto efficiency rules. The Democrats are seeking to obtain documents from Marathon Petroleum, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Legislative Exchange Council, Energy4Us, and Americans for Prosperity showing their potential involvement in the rule.

“This rollback picks one winner — the oil industry — while everyone else loses,” said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, predicting uncertainty for automakers and consumers spending more on gasoline to power less efficient cars.

Wheeler’s attacks on Nichols comes as leading U.S. automakers have made an eleventh-hour push to stop the Trump administration from dramatically weakening Obama-era fuel efficiency standards, warning doing so would bring “untenable” uncertainty and lead to drawn-out litigation.

Automakers want the Trump administration to return to the negotiating table with California, which, with more than a dozen other states, is poised to sue the administration in order to enforce stricter auto pollution rules to limit carbon emissions from transportation, the highest-emitting economic sector.

The Trump administration has proposed revoking a Clean Air Act waiver that California has, and more than a dozen other states follow, allowing it to set vehicle emission standards tougher than federal rules.

The EPA, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, last August proposed freezing Obama-era fuel efficiency rules for cars and light trucks, instead of raising them each year, between model years 2020 and 2026. It is expected to finalize the rule in the coming months.

Wheeler, and other administration officials, demonstrated little appetite for continued negotiations Thursday. Wheeler, in his letter, said that Nichols, after several meetings and conversations, offered a counterproposal to him that he did not view as a compromise, which he said would have kept the Obama-era standards while allowing one extra year of compliance.

Nichols, in her prepared testimony Thursday, said that ""EPA's professional staff and California's engineers were cut out of this proposal's development"" and argued the oil industry had undue influence on ""former oil and coal industry lobbyists and lawyers who now work in leadership at the agency.""

Later, she told the committee that Wheeler's accusations were untrue. She called his letter ""shocking.""

""I would state categorically we proposed areas in which we would be willing to compromise with the administration and we never were told precisely what was wrong with any of those proposals,"" Nichols said. ""We were simply told they were inadequate and that we somehow failed to do our job by not bringing a proposal that the administration found to be acceptable.""

Wehrum, in his testimony, downplayed internal documents showing EPA career staff questioning the assumptions of a safety analysis that NHTSA conducted justifying the weaker fuel economy standards.

These are “complicated issues,” he said, and “it is not surprising at all” there are disagreements.

The Trump administration argues the tougher Obama rules would make newer cars unaffordable, forcing drivers to use older, less safe, and environmentally unfriendly vehicles. The administration also says the previous standards are unfeasible considering consumers in recent years have preferred buying gas guzzling SUVs.

Republican lawmakers agree with that premise.

""We should not have a fractured marketplace with policies catering to urban customers,"" said Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. ""In rural America, we like big things. We like big trucks. We like big engines.""

Democrats say the weaker rules would stifle U.S. innovation of zero-emitting electric vehicles, harming efforts to combat climate change.

Automakers, who prefer flexibility in the Obama rules, not an outright rejection, consider the Trump plan too extreme.

Auto groups have said they hope to maintain a common set of rules with year-over-year increases in efficiency that California would agree to follow, allowing automakers to sell the same models in every state, and avoiding the uncertainty of prolonged litigation.

""A reasonable observer would be forgiven for seeing an administration so blinded by contempt for its predecessors and so willing to hurt consumers to support oil companies at any cost that it would defy science and common sense to move forward with a proposal with near universal condemnation from stakeholders,"" said Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y."
Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/schiff-doj-campaign-spying-probe-1370713,"House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Justice Department investigations into the origins of the Russia probe were part of an effort to ""ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election."" | Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo congress Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe Attorney General Bill Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign.

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."

The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center in 2017 asked DIU for help figuring out how to work with emerging small launch providers after Congress inserted $15 million into the Pentagon’s budget for the “Rapid Agile Launch Initiative.” DIU sought proposals from vendors for “responsive launch” options and selected four from a total of 24 submissions.

DIU defines responsive launch as “low-cost, precise, and on-demand deployment of small payloads into space.”

Small launch provider RocketLab on May 5 lifted three experimental Air Force satellites to orbit in the first of five missions planned for 2019 under the rapid launch initiative. Vox Space is on deck to launch later this year. The company will use Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rocket that is air launched from a Boeing 747 mothership.

“DIU looks at a variety of different technologies — like Rocket Labs and Vox which are more mature as well as potentially disruptive capabilities like SpinLaunch,” the DIU spokesperson told SpaceNews.

Diane Murphy, a spokeswoman for SpinLaunch, said the company came up with an entirely different approach to fly small payloads to orbit. SpinLaunch encapsulates payloads in a launch vehicle and uses ground based energy to hurl the vehicle out of its electric kinetic launcher. There are no ground based rockets or rocket fuel involved. The payload’s velocity is over four times the speed of sound and reaches space in a matter of seconds. The spinner can be powered by renewable energy like solar or wind.

Murphy said the company is building a test site at Spaceport America in New Mexico but has not yet selected a launch site. “It won’t be in Florida,” she said, because of air traffic restrictions. SpinLaunch wants to be able to launch five times a day at $250,000 per shot.

DIU will work with the four companies to map out how DoD would buy launch services. The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center has a process for buying national security launch services from companies like United Launch Alliance and SpaceX but doesn’t have a comparable procurement strategy for small launch services.

The Air Force Experimental Launch and Test Division (LEX), based at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, buys small launches for the Defense Department’s Space Test Program in onesies and twosies but not as a service. DIU will look at how these companies might be put on contract where the Air Force could buy more than one launch at a time. “There are so many new providers. It’s a way for us to touch different parts of the market and try them all out,” the DIU spokesperson said.

Request for information

Separately from the DIU program, the Air Force is surveying the small launch industry to better understand what different companies bring to the table. On May 30 the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate issued a request from vendors for a “statement of capabilities” to meet rapid space launch requirements. Proposals are due July 15.

“The U.S. Air Force is investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner,” the solicitation said. “The objective is 24 hours from ‘call up’ notification to on-orbit capability.”

Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Commander Lt. Gen. John Thompson said SMC wants to partner “with many small launch providers to get 400 kg or 450 kg payloads to low Earth orbit as reliably and cheaply as possible.” The industry is undergoing some turbulence right now as companies are still figuring out their business models, Thompson said last week at a conference hosted by MITRE. “It’s rough and tumble right now. … SMC is engaged with small launch providers to test, certify and make sure providers can do what we need to do, do it reliably and do it rapidly.”

A more recent DIU solicitation that just closed on June 16 focused on “tactical launch.” It asked for “commercial solutions to demonstrate the capacity for rapid, low cost, flexible launch using mobile or transportable solutions that allow for operations independent of fixed-site launch infrastructure. … Solutions should be capable of long range, suborbital flight to the limit of placing small payloads into mission-designed low Earth orbits.”

There is excitement in the Air Force about cheaper and faster launch, said Robert Unverzagt, principal director of civil and commercial launch projects at the Aerospace Corp., a federally funded research and development organization that supports Air Force space launch operations.

But he cautioned that the Air Force will have to adjust its expectations as it looks to buy more services from commercial providers. SMC is used to working with big rocket manufacturers that design their vehicles to meet government requirements and ensure the risks of losing expensive satellites are minimized. That type of “mission assurance” would not apply when working with small launch providers that would be flying lower cost payloads and where more risk could be tolerated, Unverzagt said at the MITRE conference.

“It’s a balance between risk tolerance versus responsiveness,” he said. “It’s an equation that the government has to come to terms with,” Unverzagt added. “Government mission assurance has to be appropriately sized to allow this responsiveness.”"
"Situation Room briefing on Iran crisis concludes, as McConnell says 'measured' response is coming",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'House Republican Leader Kevin Mccarthy', 'Ranking Gop Members', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/situation-room-briefing-on-iran-crisis-concludes-as-mcconnell-says-measured-response-coming,"Top administration officials and lawmakers have left the White House after a classified briefing lasting over an hour, about Iran's sudden downing of an American surveillance drone in the Middle East -- and a ""measured"" U.S. response, they suggested, is likely coming soon.

Amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Iran, the White House earlier Thursday invited House and Senate leaders and Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees to meet with President Trump in the White House's secure Situation Room.

Others who arrived for the meeting included CIA Director Gina Haspel, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Army Secretary Mark Esper, whom Trump has said he'll nominate as defense secretary.

Shanahan was spotted outside the White House carrying a folder stamped ""SECRET/NOFORN,"" an intelligence classification category prohibiting distribution to anyone outside the government.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News that ""we had a good briefing"" and that the Trump administration would engage in ""measured responses.""

McConnell confirmed the U.S.'s firm position that the drone was operating in international airspace, even as Iran has tried to make the case that the drone had ""violated"" Iranian airspace.

In a statement, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Ranking Members Michael McCaul of Texas (House Foreign Affairs), Devin Nunes of California (House Intelligence), and Mac Thornberry of Texas (House Armed Services) all condemned Iran's ""direct attack,"" and demanded ""measured"" retaliation.

""Iran directly attacked a United States asset over international waters,"" the Republicans wrote. ""This provocation comes a week after they attacked and destroyed two commercial tankers in international waters. There must be a measured response to these actions. President Trump and his national security team remain clear-eyed on the situation and what must be done in response to increased Iranian aggression. In Congress, we stand ready to support our men and women in uniform, our country, and our allies in the region.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a separate statement after the briefing calling for calm.

TRUMP SAYS IRAN’S US DRONE SHOOT-DOWN MAY HAVE BEEN ‘MISTAKE,’ BUT ‘COUNTRY WILL NOT STAND FOR IT’

“In light of the targeting of an unmanned U.S. drone by Iran, it is essential that we remain fully engaged with our allies, recognize that we are not dealing with a responsible adversary and do everything in our power to de-escalate.

“This is a dangerous, high-tension situation that requires a strong, smart and strategic, not reckless, approach,"" Pelosi said.

Speaking to reporters, Pelosi said she also was convinced that U.S. intelligence was correct in its assessment that the drone was in international airspace when it was shot down. But, Pelosi added, the Trump administration legally would need to obtain Congress' approval before taking military action.

""We make it very clear that to get involved in any military activities, we must have a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),"" Pelosi cautioned.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he told the president during the briefing that there should be a ""robust, open debate,"" and that Congress should ""have a real say.""

He said he was worried the administration ""may bumble into a war.""

""We have an amendment supported by every Democrat to the NDAA in the Senate, led by Senator Udall, which would require Congressional approval of any funding for a conflict in Iran,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""It's supported by all Democrats in the Senate. We are asking leader McConnell to do the right thing and give us a vote next week on the NDAA on that amendment.""

Footage on social media also showed Schumer appearing to celebrate after the briefing, but Schumer later clarified that he was happy his mother had been released from the hospital.

Hours earlier, the Pentagon released video showing the smoke trail of a Navy drone that was shot out of the sky over the Strait of Hormuz by Iran, in what military officials described as an ""unprovoked attack.""

Trump told reporters that Iran made a ""very big mistake"" but also said he had the feeling that it might have been the result of someone being ""loose"" or doing something ""stupid,"" rather than a deliberate provocation by Iran.

The U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk, an unmanned aircraft with a wingspan larger than that of a Boeing 737, was downed by an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps surface-to-air missile that was fired from near Goruk on Wednesday night, according to Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. Air Forces Central Command.

""This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission,"" Guastella said. ""This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and free flow of commerce.""

Guastella said at the time it was struck by the missile, the drone was operating at a ""high altitude"" over 20 miles from the nearest point of land on the Iranian coast.

Some Democrats, for their part, blamed Trump for the episode. Presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump has made military conflict with Iran more likely, and that ""another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.""

""Iran directly attacked a United States asset over international waters."" — House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Ranking GOP Members

Biden said Trump's strategy in Iran has been ""a self-inflicted disaster"" since the president withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement negotiated when Biden served under then-President Barack Obama as vice president.

The Trump administration called that deal a reckless giveaway to a dangerous regime that only emboldened and empowered its imperialistic and terroristic ambitions. By reimposing sanctions that had been lifted under the Obama-era deal, Trump administration policies largely have crippled Iran's economy, sending inflation above 30 percent and devastating oil revenues.

Biden asserted there's no question Iran ""continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities."" But, he added that the U.S. needed presidential leadership.

US NAVY DRONE SHOT DOWN BY IRANIAN MISSILE OVER STRAIT OF HORMUZ IN 'UNPROVOKED ATTACK,' CENTRAL COMMAND SAYS

In a video released Thursday afternoon, the smoke trail of the drone could be seen in a black-and-white video as the craft plummeted.

Guastella said the drone landed in ""international waters"" about 20 miles from Iran. U.S. officials told Fox News that investigators were racing to find the wreckage ahead of Iranian forces.

The U.S. Navy’s RQ-4A Global Hawk drone provides real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions ""over vast ocean and coastal regions,"" according to the military. The drone was deployed to the Middle East in the past few days as part of reinforcements approved by Trump last month.

The high-altitude drone can fly up to 60,000 feet or 11 miles in altitude and stay aloft for 30 hours at a time. It's used to spy on Iranian military communications and track shipping in the busy waterways. Each drone costs up to $180 million.

Also Thursday afternoon, presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., demanded that Trump abstain from sending American troops into a conflict with Iran without congressional approval.

In recent weeks, the U.S. has sped an aircraft carrier to the Mideast and approved sending 1,000 additional troops ""to address air, naval, and ground-based threats"" in the region. Mysterious attacks have targeted oil tankers as Iranian-allied Houthi rebels launched bomb-laden drones into Saudi Arabia.

The New York senator outlined her position in a sharply worded letter to the White House on Thursday.

Gillibrand wrote she was ""deeply concerned that your administration's stepped up military presence in the Middle East, in conjunction with your dangerous and confusing rhetoric, may lead the United States into a protracted, costly, and unnecessary war with Iran. Such a war is not authorized, would unnecessarily risk the lives of Americans and our allies, cause enormous human suffering, and destabilize the economy.""

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

"State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
Working BlueKeep Exploit Developed by DHS,https://threatpost.com,"[""Lindsey O'Donnell""]",,,,https://threatpost.com/working-bluekeep-exploit-developed-by-dhs/145784/,"The Department of Homeland Security urged system administrators to update their Windows machines after testing a working BlueKeep exploit for Windows 2000.

The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it has developed a working exploit for the “wormable” BlueKeep vulnerability. The agency issued an alert on Monday urging Windows users to update their machines as soon as possible.

The alert heightens concerns that malicious actors could soon also develop their own exploits of the BlueKeep flaw. The critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708), though fixed during Microsoft’s May Patch Tuesday Security Bulletin, continues to plague the security industry. Experts have warned that it could pave the way for a similar rapidly-propogating attack on the scale of the devastating 2017 WannaCry attack.

The The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed on Monday that it was able to exploit the flaw on a Windows 2000 machine, which marks another operating system impacted by the flaw that was not part of Microsoft’s original alert: “CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep,” according to its advisory.

The critical bug exists in Remote Desktop Services and impacts older versions of Windows, including Windows 7, Windows XP, Server 2003 and Server 2008, Microsoft said in its original alert. This original alert did not mention Windows 2000 machines.

While Microsoft has released patches for a number of operating systems that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, the company will not patch Windows 2000 systems, according to a TechCrunch report.

“We strongly recommend that any customers using Windows 2000 should update to a supported operating system as soon as possible,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost. “Modern operating systems include built-in protections against this, and many other threats.”

Support for Windows 2000 machines ended in 2010. For Windows users running on systems that cannot be patched, CISA recommended that they upgrade end-of-life operating systems, disable unnecessary services and enable network level authentication.

For those who are running on systems for which patches are available, CISA joined Microsoft, the National Security Agency and others in urging system administrators to update as soon as possible, warning of the potential WannaCry-level event.

“The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is issuing this Activity Alert to provide information on a vulnerability, known as ‘BlueKeep,’ that exists in the following Microsoft Windows Operating Systems, including both 32- and 64-bit versions, as well as all Service Pack versions,” according to CISA’s alert.

The multiple warnings are warranted. As of the end of May, one million devices were still vulnerable to BlueKeep.

Worries around the vulnerability are mounting: Earlier in June, a researcher created a proof-of-concept Metasploit module for the critical BlueKeep vulnerability, which successfully demonstrates how to achieve complete takeover of a target Windows machine.

At the same time, threat actors are actively sniffing out vulnerable devices. Researchers with GreyNoise in May said that they are “observing sweeping tests for systems vulnerable to the RDP ‘BlueKeep’ (CVE-2019-0708) vulnerability from several dozen hosts around the Internet.”

Satnam Narang, senior research engineer at Tenable, said that the level of attention by CISA and other organizations is “certainly warranted.”

“The writing is on the wall; BlueKeep has the potential to cause widespread devastation, similar to the Wannacry worm in 2017,” he said in an email. “Organizations must act and patch vulnerable systems, or implement mitigations if patching isn’t easily viable.”

He is blind to the definition of a double-blind study, which he completely misinterpreted, and he is blind to the value of accurate scientific advice.

First, some background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) depends on double-blind studies for its decisions. But EPA is not FDA, and limitations on the ability of environmental health scientists to do double-blind studies are a major reason.

EPA has proposed a rule, inaccurately calling it a ""transparency rule."" It virtually requires EPA to discard any study for which the raw data is not made publicly available from consideration in agency rulemaking. Transparency, of course, sounds like a good idea as does the ability to replicate studies. But those who support the so-called transparency rule implausibly argue that EPA should align with the FDA’s rules for studies submitted in support of new drugs or medical devices.

What do health scientists mean by a double-blind study? Imagine a study in which patients with an existing disease are asked to volunteer for a study — a clinical trial — of a potentially valuable new therapeutic drug and the individual is randomly assigned to the group receiving the placebo or the drug. A single-blind study is usually one in which the patient does not know whether she or he is receiving the new drug or a placebo. But the gold standard is a randomized double-blind study in which neither the patient nor the observing health professional is aware of which group the patient is in until the study is completed and analyzed.

Why won’t this work for almost any environmental health studies? Simply put, would you willingly volunteer to be exposed to a pollutant, not to see what good it does, but what harm it might cause?

Environmental health studies look at what evidence is available, generally studies of populations that have been exposed to pollutants as a result of bad practices or ignorance, to determine the health effects of pollutants on humans. We must depend on the published scientific web of multiple studies done by different authors on different populations using different research approaches.

To study pollutant effects, we take advantage of differences in exposure due to geographical factors, such as a source of a pollutant located in one city but not another; temporal factors such as evaluating communities before and after hydrofracturing for shale gas; or idiosyncratic differences in exposure perhaps related to a pollutant-laden tanker overturning in a community.

FDA drug studies are also different in other ways. Consider the many possible difficulties in measuring actual human exposure under environmental situations as compared to FDA studies in which the dose of a new drug and the health impact of concern is specified in the study design. In addition, FDA studies specify the required number of study subjects through a power calculation based upon relatively rigid determinations of the differences among the subject groups that would be meaningful — something much more subject to argument after environmental health studies are completed.

The likely goal of the transparency rule promoted by Wheeler and his industry supporters is to obtain raw data that can be used by paid industry consultants who then nitpick to find minor blemishes in each study. These blemishes are then falsely magnified into issues that seemingly affect the validity of the study, as occurred with the study of the hazards of exposure to formaldehyde.

So how did Wheeler react to criticism that he is misapplying FDA’s approach to transparency? First, it seems clear that his objective is to marginalize science review. At the long-delayed June 5 meeting of the SAB, Wheeler finally allowed the members to consider the transparency rule long after it was released for public comment. Normally, the SAB provides input before the agency issues a proposed rule for public comment. Wheeler is reshaping the process to turn SAB review into just another public comment, contrary to longstanding EPA practice under multiple Republican and Democratic administrations.

Then Wheeler showed his ignorance by saying “FDA routinely uses the double-blind scientific studies for their work where they have two teams of researchers replicating the same data, both teams don’t know each other exist and where they are.” He added, “that federal research would be more accepted by the public if you used the double-blind standard for everything,” providing a rationale that misstates how research on human exposure to pollution is conducted.

The problem with this mistaken interpretation goes beyond its implications for the proposed EPA rulemaking on transparency. The definition of a “double-blind study” is not insider baseball known only to a few technical experts. It is widely known and used within the scientific community. One can be certain that virtually all of EPA’s scientific staff knowledgeable about health science would be able to correctly define the term. It’s likely Wheeler is too aware of his personal scientific limitations to have made this mistake on his own. He arguably needed someone whom he thought was scientifically knowledgeable to feed him this ludicrous misinformation about double blind studies. This is further evidence that EPA leadership is taking advice from political outsiders, not experienced EPA career scientists. One possible interpretation is that Wheeler is a gullible tool of the industry for whom he was a lobbyist before coming to EPA.

This obvious mistake also highlights the failure of Wheeler and former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittHow EPA Administrator Wheeler completely misinterprets science The Memo: Can Trump run as an outsider?

Cooking outdoors is challenging, especially during the summer. Be sure to follow these steps to food safety to prepare for the occasion!

The summer months are the perfect excuse to spend time at the beach. The best memories in my childhood are with my family enjoying a day at the beach grilling. My parents organized every detail of the trip but looking back and knowing what I know now about food safety, our beach grilling fun could have easily been spoiled with bacteria that could have made us sick.

There are always challenges when cooking outdoors, but a little bit of preparation can have you basking in the sun, enjoying some well-deserved beach time with the family.

Before Firing Up the Beach - Grill

Make sure local ordinances allow grilling activities. If yes…it’s time to pack!

Only pack the amount of food you will consume to avoid leftovers.

Season your favorite meats, poultry or seafood at home before packing them for the trip. Remember to wash your hands before handling the raw items and in between spice containers when seasoning.

Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler.

Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry tightly wrapped and store them at the bottom of the cooler. This will help keep any running juices away from cooked foods or foods meant to be eaten raw (e.g. fruits, veggies, salsas, guacamole or bean salad).

Pack the drinks in a separate cooler so the food cooler is not opened frequently.

A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. If you still have space in your portable cooler, pack it full with more ice.

Don’t forget to bring moist towelettes and the food thermometer!

Keeping Food Safe Ashore

Once you arrive at the beach, partially bury your portable cooler in the sand, cover it with blankets or towels, and shade it under a tree or with a beach umbrella.

Do not open the lid of your cooler containing perishable foods unless necessary. This will keep perishable foods colder for a longer time.

Don't leave any perishables sitting out in the hot sun for more than 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F).

Start setting up your grill and get it clean before bringing the food out.

Clean your hands before placing any foods on the grill.

Beach - Grill Time

Make sure your grilled items are safe to eat by using a food thermometer and checking to see if they reached the right minimum internal temperatures: Beef, pork, lamb and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145°F with a three-minute rest. Fish: 145°F Ground beef, veal, lamb, or pork burgers: 160°F. Poultry (whole or ground): 165°F.

Serve all your delicious food using clean plates and utensils.

Remember: Clean your hands before starting to eat!

If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET. Callers may also listen to food safety messages on various topics, recorded in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day. You can also email or chat via Ask Karen."
William Barr’s Justice Department Is Now Openly Running Legal Interference for Paul Manafort,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/paul-manafort-william-barr-new-york-prison.html,"President Donald Trump listens to Attorney General William Barr during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on May 22 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has decided to run interference for Paul Manafort, protecting him from harsh imprisonment and even questioning the validity of charges brought against him by state prosecutors. This effort to aid the president’s loyal associate behind bars is a startling escalation of Attorney General William Barr’s campaign to help Trump and his confederates evade consequences for their misdeeds.

Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2018 then pleaded guilty to illegal foreign lobbying and witness tampering. He was first prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who secured a 7.5-year federal prison sentence earlier this year. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance then brought 16 additional charges under New York law. Manafort is currently housed in Loretto, a federal prison in southwest Pennsylvania, and Vance’s office requested his transfer to a New York facility. (Typically, federal prisoners awaiting trial in New York state court are held in the notoriously brutal Rikers Island jail.)

In May, Manafort attorney Todd Blanche wrote a letter to Vicky Moser, Loretto’s warden, protesting this transfer. Blanche asked that Manafort be allowed to remain in Loretto to address his “health challenges” and preserve his “reasonable access to counsel.” And Blanche had another reason his client deserved special treatment: Manafort, Blanche alleged, “is being prosecuted in New York for exactly the same conduct for which he has already been tried and sentenced” in federal court. The New York prosecution thus “appears to be a blatant violation” of the state’s “long-standing and highly protective” double jeopardy laws. Condemning Vance’s actions as “politics at its worst,” Blanche declared that Vance is “attempting to add insult to injury” by placing his client on Rikers Island. In other words, Manafort should not be moved to New York because the New York charges against him are invalid.

By itself, this letter would be unremarkable, a plea from his top-shelf lawyer that Manafort be treated better than virtually every other inmate in the United States. What is remarkable—indeed, shocking—is that the deputy attorney general, the second-highest law enforcement official in the country, seemed to implicitly endorse Blanche’s complaints. On June 11, Jeffrey Rosen forwarded the letter to Vance’s office and asked for a “response” before federal officials made “a decision” about moving Manafort to New York. Rosen even gave Vance a deadline, asking him to respond within a week.

Rosen’s letter creates the impression that the Justice Department is working to undermine state charges against Manafort.

On June 14, Vance responded to Rosen granting Blanche’s request. He also forwarded Rosen a separate letter written by Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy to Loretto’s warden. Conroy described the proposed arrangement as “a departure from usual practice” and “inconsistent” with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. But the district attorney would allow it anyway, almost certainly because Rosen threw the weight of the Department of Justice behind the effort to protect Manafort and attack state charges that Trump would not be able to pardon.

Conroy further noted that the district attorney’s office never actually tried to put Manafort at Rikers Island; it merely sought “temporary custody” in any nearby facility so Manafort could be “made available for arraignment and subsequent proceedings in a timely manner.” Regardless, the district attorney would let Manafort remain at Loretto so long as the feds promised to make him available in New York court “without interruption or delay.”

Vance himself responded to Blanche’s accusations that the New York charges are an illegal violation of double jeopardy. These “gratuitous” arguments, Vance wrote, “have no place in a routine procedural analysis” of inmate relocation. Conroy’s letter also pointed out that if Manafort “believes he has valid statutory double jeopardy” defenses, he “will have a full opportunity to pursue” them in New York court.

For the record, Blanche is probably right that some charges in the New York indictment should fall under the state’s unusually strict double jeopardy regime. But Vance brought other charges under state laws with elements and purposes distinct from their federal counterparts that could to fall outside of double jeopardy protections. For instance, New York laws criminalizing the falsification of business records differ substantially from the federal fraud charges for which Manafort was convicted. While Blanche can mount a plausible argument that the New York indictment runs afoul of state double jeopardy charges, it is certainly not so clear-cut that the state charges should be treated as entirely illegitimate.

I happen to think that no one should be housed in Rikers Island, a hotbed of human rights abuses that ought to be permanently shuttered. I also think states should be prohibited from prosecuting an individual for a crime already punished by the federal government. But I do not believe that the United States Department of Justice should intervene on behalf of the president’s associate to secure benefits for him that no other prisoner receives. It is, in fact, an appalling perversion of the agency’s putative integrity, particularly in light of persistent speculation that Trump may pardon Manafort.

If he does, the task will fall to states to hold Manafort accountable for his crimes, since the president cannot pardon state offenses. Rosen’s letter creates two inescapable impressions: First, that the Department of Justice—so recently responsible for putting Manafort behind bars—is now attempting to keep him as comfortable as possible until Trump issues his pardon; and second, that the DOJ is working to undermine the validity of state charges against Manafort so that he would not languish in state prison if he receives a presidential pardon.

None of this is surprising with Barr in control of the DOJ. A chronic liar and smear artist, Barr has swiftly sullied the agency, turning it into an especially powerful arm of Trump’s PR machine. He and his deputies have all but announced that they have Manafort’s back. Even as the DOJ slow-walks and obstructs the implementation of the First Step Act, keeping rehabilitated prisoners incarcerated for no reason, it helps protect Manafort from the cruelties of the criminal justice system. This is a level of corruption usually only seen in kleptocratic nations. Now it’s right out in the open in these United States."

"Man whose family fell ill at Dominican Republic resort: 'Think twice, think hard' about traveling there",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/virginia-family-falls-ill-punta-cana-dominican-republic-resort,"A man whose family fell ill on a recent vacation to the Dominican Republic told ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday that he would advise people to ""think hard"" about whether they should travel to the Caribbean nation.

The popular vacation destination has seen a rash of deaths and illnesses of American tourists at local resorts.

Nine Americans this year have died in various hotels in oddly similar circumstances – including one couple who died together inside their hotel room. Neither the Dominican Ministry of Public Health nor the Ministry of Tourism has publicly shared the final autopsy reports showing the reasons why the men and women succumbed.

The strange cases -- along with the recent shooting of ex-MLB star David Ortiz -- has triggered a wave of speculation and questions from the victims’ families in the United States and has prompted many to question whether the island is safe for visitors.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC'S HEALTH MINISTRY CALLS MYSTERIOUS DEATHS 'FAKE NEWS' AS OFFICIAL LASHES OUT IN INTERVIEW

FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF WOMAN WHO DIED IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC CLAIM AUTHORITIES ARE LYING ABOUT PAST 'SEVERAL HEART ATTACKS'

Tim Jensen, a native of Virginia, and his family vacationed at the Hard Rock Hotel and Resort in Punta Cana earlier this month.

At least two Americans have died at the resort under mysterious circumstances since last year, prompting the family to call for the hotel to close while an investigation is conducted.

“In my opinion, they should shut down that hotel and figure out what’s going down,” Amy Burbach Jensen told The New York Post.

Tim Jensen said his family members did not drink from the hotel minibar after seeing news reports about people sickened. He said the first two days of the trip went well, but on June 11 his son became violently ill after dinner and other members of the family fell ill soon after.

He said after dinner, they started to feel lightheaded and experience stomach pain. He said everyone ate something different and he experienced stomach issues despite not drinking alcohol.

The family was on the trip to celebrate his 18-year-old son's high school graduation and impending departure to West Point.

""This basically wrecked the rest of our vacation, it was not fun,"" he said, cautioning that vacationers should add travel insurance when booking a trip, expressing regret that he did not purchase it.

""Me personally and our family, we're never going to the Dominican Republic again. It's sad,"" he said.

The hotel defended its procedures in a statement earlier this month.

""We can assure you, the safety and health of our guests is now, and has always been, our highest priority,"" the resort said on June 11.

""We are confident that all operational protocols were followed to ensure the safety of our guests.""

Jensen said he filed a report at the hotel about the illnesses, but has heard nothing back.

Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Adam Coleman', 'Allison Bagley', 'Brian T. Smith', 'Massarah Mikati', 'Staff Writer', 'David Barron']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."

Indian Workers on H-1B Visas Could Be Casualties of a U.S. Trade Spat,http://fortune.com,['David Meyer'],06-20-2019,2019,6,http://fortune.com/2019/06/20/h1b-visa-india-cap/,"With the trade war between the U.S. and China regularly dominating headlines, it’s easy to forget that the U.S. is also engaged in trade disputes with other countries, such India.

Unless, of course, you’re an Indian worker who wants to get a job in the U.S. Because if that’s the case, then your opportunities might be about to get more limited.

Having recently cancelled concessions on the importation of almost 2,000 Indian products—a move that prompted New Delhi to impose higher tariffs on American goods—the U.S. is now reported to be threatening new caps on the numbers of Indians that can get an American H-1B work visa. The U.S. State Department denies that the Trump administration is mulling this.

However, if the report is correct, tens of thousands fewer Indians might be able to get U.S. work visas each year. This could have a big impact on Indian companies with a U.S. presence—the visas allow people to stay there for up to six years—and also on Silicon Valley, where many H-1B-holding immigrants are employed.

Data localization

According to Reuters, the idea is not to explicitly target India with the move—the White House probably lacks the authority to do that—but rather to threaten new H-1B visa limits on countries that have so-called “data localization” laws.

The State Department denied this, saying: “The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally.”

Data localization policies force companies to store the personal data of a country’s citizens on servers located in that country. India waded into these waters last year when its central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said all Indian transaction data had to be stored in India and nowhere else.

As is generally the case with data localization laws, the given reasons included aiding Indian law-enforcement investigations and providing better security to the country’s citizens. However, the U.S. lobbied against it—after all, many of the affected tech and financial firms, from Visa and Mastercard to Google and Amazon, are American. And when the implementation deadline arrived in October, many of those companies were not ready.

The argument is still ongoing. Just this week, the RBI promised the companies it would “look into” their concerns.

Targeting India

As for how the U.S. H-1B visa cap would specifically target India, that’s a function of how many of the 85,000 such visas granted each year go to people from the country.

The new cap for countries with data-localization laws is reportedly between 10% and 15% of all H-1B visas issued. India isn’t the only country with data-localization laws—China and Russia’s versions are much more restrictive—but as much as 70% of H-1B visas currently go to Indians. That means the cut would disproportionately hit people going from India to the U.S. for work.

The Times of India spoke to several lawyers who mostly said the matter could end up before the U.S. courts if President Donald Trump tries to push through the change by executive order, as the rules for allocating H-1B visas were set out by Congress, and it’s not up to the president to change them. A Democrat-controlled House is unlikely to approve of Trump’s move, they said. However, one lawyer—NPZ Law Group’s Snehal Batra—pointed out that congressional approval might not be required if the overall number of H-1B visas was not being changed.

Ultimately, the move could fall foul of the rule in the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that forbids discrimination against any particular country when issuing visas, immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta told the newspaper.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to announce the repeal on Wednesday, according to the Journal, which has seen a copy of the summary. It would fulfill a campaign promise made by Donald Trump to boost coal plant productivity."
