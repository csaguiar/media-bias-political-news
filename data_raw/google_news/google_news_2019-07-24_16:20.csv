Top liberal think tank says Trump's 'rule of law' message on immigration is winning,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-liberal-think-tanks-says-trumps-rule-of-law-message-on-immigraition-is-winning-dems-appear-weak-on-enforcement,"A top liberal think tank has warned that President Trump’s immigration message is actually winning among most voters and makes Democrats appear weak on enforcement.

The Center for American Progress has released a new report arguing that as Democrats drifted away from the “rule of law” message, it allowed Republicans to rebrand their party as the sole party of rule of law.

IRA MEHLMAN: DEMOCRATS COMMIT POLITICAL SUICIDE ON IMMIGRATION

This created “the false dichotomy of America as either a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws” that then makes Democrats seem weak on enforcing the nation’s laws, according to the Daily Beast that first obtained the report.

Tom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the think tank, added that those supporting humane immigration policy “have ceded powerful rhetorical ground to immigration restrictionists, who are happy to masquerade as the sole defenders of America as a nation of laws.”

The paper coincides with Trump’s renewed calls to reform immigration laws, arguing that they don’t stop the problem of illegal immigration and have significant loopholes.

“We’ve got to straighten out our immigration laws,” Trump said during a rally in North Carolina last week. “You know, in a very short period of time, if the Democrats would give us a few votes, we could solve the immigration problem and it would be so great.”

MOST DEMS VOW TO DECRIMINALIZE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DURING NIGHT 2 DEBATE

Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, meanwhile, have been struggling to find an effective message that counter Trump’s rhetoric and without appearing as embracing extreme policies.

But according to the report, radical proposals such as nationwide amnesty or the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) only “fuels louder calls for maximum enforcement, which then strengthen calls for abolition, ad infinitum.”

Scores of candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, have backed the proposal to decriminalize illegal border crossings and no longer treat the crime as a criminal matter.

Only Sen. Michael Bennet rejected the proposal, while former Vice President Joe Biden took no position on the matter.

"Ahead of hearing, Trump aims fury at an unlikely target: Mueller aide Aaron Zebley",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tim Elfrink', 'Editor Of The Morning Mix', 'July At Am', ""Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix.""]",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/07/24/donald-trump-aaron-zebley-robert-mueller-congress-testimony/,"

Aaron Zebley, Robert S. Mueller III's former chief of staff at the FBI and a top aide on his probe into Russian interference, drew the ire of President Trump on Tuesday over his planned testimony before Congress. (AP)

On the eve of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s long-awaited congressional testimony, President Trump vented his fury on Twitter — but not at Mueller.

Trump’s ire on Tuesday night was reserved for Aaron Zebley, a top Mueller aide added at the 11th hour by Democratic lawmakers as a sworn witness in Wednesday’s hearing before the House Intelligence Committee and as an adviser to Mueller in his House Judiciary Committee testimony.

Calling Zebley a “Never Trumper lawyer” involved in the “Crooked Hillary case,” the president termed his last-minute inclusion in the hearing a “disgrace.” “This should NOT be allowed,” Trump tweeted late on Tuesday. “Rigged Witch Hunt!”

The president’s outrage continued early on Wednesday, as he argued in another tweet that he “NEVER would have agreed” to Zebley’s role in the hearings.

It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to, and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history, by far! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2019

[Mueller’s longtime aide to counsel him at House committee hearing]

If Mueller — a rigidly impartial lawman and longtime registered Republican — was always an awkward target for Trump’s anger, Zebley is an even more unlikely character to face the brunt of presidential indignation.

Once a globe-trotting special agent, he spent years hunting terrorists before becoming a federal prosecutor and then Mueller’s chief of staff at the FBI. He’s also apolitical, despite Trump’s claims, with no donations to either party, according to federal records. But his role during a stint in private practice representing a former Hillary Clinton aide during the FBI probe into her use of a private email server earned him a starring, if unnamed, role in Trump’s Twitter feed.

So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2019

A graduate of the College of William & Mary and the University of Virginia School of Law, Zebley was assigned as a young agent to the FBI’s I-49 squad, a group then devoted to hunting down the bombers who attacked U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, according to author Garrett M. Graff’s book “The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War in the Age of Global Terror.”

Zebley showed his operational mettle in 1999 while tracking a bombing suspect to South Africa, Graff writes. When he got to Cape Town, he realized the man he was hunting wasn’t there after all — but quickly learned that one of the nation’s most wanted terrorists, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, was living as a refugee in town. So Zebley and his partner staked out a center where refugees got their documents stamped until Mohamed showed up, then baited him into a government building before tackling him and shipping him back to the U.S. for trial. He was later sentenced to life in prison.

After years on the terrorism beat, on Sept. 10, 2001, Zebley transferred to a criminal investigation division — a reassignment that lasted exactly one day, until terrorists struck the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The veteran agent soon became a key player in PENTTBOM, the FBI’s massive probe into the 9/11 attacks, toiling in the basement of the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Zebley helped build the case against 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui and took the stand during the death-penalty phase of his trial in 2006 to testify about the agency’s work.

After a stint as an assistant U.S. attorney in Northern Virginia, Zebley served as Mueller’s chief of staff while he was FBI director. In 2014, he followed his boss into private practice in Washington as a partner at WilmerHale, where he helped Mueller on notable cases, including a probe into the NFL’s handling of star running back Ray Rice’s domestic violence case.

In 2017, he left behind a $1.4 million gig at WilmerHale to join Mueller’s probe into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Along with Mueller’s deputy, James L. Quarles III, and another former prosecutor, Michael Dreeben, he was among the inner circle directing the investigation.

Soon after his appointment to the team, some conservatives zeroed in on one of Zebley’s private practice cases as they made the argument that Mueller’s operation was slanted against the president.

They noted that Zebley had represented Justin Cooper, an ex-adviser to former president Bill Clinton who helped Hillary Clinton set up the private email server that would later become the center of a federal probe. Although Cooper later testified to Congress, earning plaudits from Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, for “having the guts to actually answer questions,” commentators such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson argued that Zebley’s work suggested a bias against Trump.

That line of attack reemerged on Tuesday, when Democrats announced that they had agreed to allow Zebley a role in Wednesday’s hearings.

[The important things Robert Mueller could tell us — if he wants to]

Mueller had requested that Zebley be allowed to testify at both committee hearings, The Washington Post’s Rachael Bade and Matt Zapotosky reported, but the Judiciary Committee denied that request. Instead, Zebley will sit next to the former special counsel and advise him on his answers. Zebley will be sworn in to the Intelligence Committee.

Republicans cried foul about the surprise move.

""The chairman’s unprecedented decision to allow a witness’s counsel to both advise him privately and simultaneously testify alongside him shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans,” said Rep. Douglas A. Collins of Georgia, the Judiciary Committee’s top Republican.

Other elected Republicans quickly noted Zebley’s link to the Clinton email server case.

Remember Aaron Zebley?



He represented a key figure in the Clinton email scandal & transitioned to the Mueller witch hunt against @realDonaldTrump.



Judiciary Democrats are now attempting to call him to the witness table beside Mueller tomorrow.



Talk about stacking the deck. — Rep Andy Biggs (@RepAndyBiggsAZ) July 23, 2019

Trump, too, slammed the news, suggesting that Zebley’s inclusion was an “unfair” trick by Democrats.

Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2019

Mueller’s office, though, says that Zebley is there simply to aid Mueller — the same role he’s played for years, dating back to their work at the FBI. Indeed, in the lead-up to his testimony, The Post reported, Mueller’s former chief of staff has been holed up in a law office helping him prepare for the testimony.

“Aaron Zebley was the Deputy Special Counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the Office,” Jim Popkin, a Mueller spokesman, said in a statement. “He will accompany Special Counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.”

Opinion | The Cruelty of Trump’s Poverty Policy,https://www.nytimes.com,['David A. Super'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/opinion/trump-poverty-policy.html,"On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced proposed rules that would cut more than three million people off food assistance. This latest plan confirms what many have long suspected: The only thing unifying its policies on poverty is cruelty. Prior right-ring assaults on the poor at least claimed some semblance of a coherent theme. In contrast, this proposal, and earlier ones, are a grab-bag of mutually inconsistent ideas seemingly selected only to maximize harm.

When President Ronald Reagan attacked anti-poverty programs, he claimed to be limiting assistance to the poorest of the poor. He insisted he was protecting a “safety net” for the “tru ly needy.” To do this, he denied aid to millions of working families. Under the rules he pushed through Congress, almost any wages were enough to disqualify a family from cash assistance and Medicaid within a few months. Working families had their food assistance cut and their paperwork requirements increased.

Of course, his concern for the extremely poor went only so far: The savings from these cuts paid for his massive tax cut for the rich, not for helping the poorest families afford food or housing.

A decade later, another Republican, Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, carried out even deeper cuts to anti-poverty programs, contending he was addressing a failure of recipients of public benefits to work. He lamented that only a small fraction of cash assistance recipients worked while they received aid. This was, of course, precisely the goal of the Reagan changes. Most welfare recipients did in fact seek and find work — but they were promptly thrown off the assistance rolls when they did."
Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."
Mark Esper Confirmed as Trump’s Defense Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com,['Helene Cooper'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/mark-esper-secretary-defense.html,"Meanwhile, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who was a former West Point classmate of Mr. Esper — have largely run national security policy in the months since Mr. Mattis departed. Mr. Esper’s challenge, national security experts said, will be to work to get the Pentagon’s views represented among those strong personalities.

“The protracted period without a permanent defense secretary has created a vacuum,” Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said in an email. “That situation has decreased D.O.D.’s influence on critical matters involving national security and military affairs and limited D.O.D.’s ability to affect important policymaking generally and on specific issues,” especially Iran, China and North Korea.

“The president needs the best advice, particularly on national security, from numerous perspectives, partly as a counterbalance to the apparently outsized recent influence being exercised by Pompeo, Bolton and perhaps others in the White House and Trump’s orbit,” Mr. Tobias said. He said that need “may help explain the unusually bipartisan, overwhelming confirmation vote that Esper secured.”

Indeed, Mr. Esper’s confirmation process was largely fast and smooth, reflecting lawmakers’ eagerness for stability at the Pentagon.

But during his confirmation hearing, some Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised questions about Mr. Esper’s ties to the defense industry. Ms. Warren, who is running for president in 2020, in particular was critical of Mr. Esper’s refusal to recuse himself from all matters involving Raytheon once he becomes defense secretary. She voted against his confirmation.

In fact, five of the eight senators — all Democrats — voting against Mr. Esper are presidential aspirants in 2020: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ms. Warren.

The confirmation of Mr. Esper, who was sworn in later Tuesday, does not end the leadership void at the Pentagon, which still has no permanent deputy secretary of defense. David Norquist, Mr. Trump’s nominee for that job, is scheduled for his own Senate hearing on Wednesday."
Barr says Mueller asked DOJ to send letter limiting testimony to ‘boundaries' of report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-mueller-asked-doj-to-send-him-letter-saying-testimony-must-remain-within-boundaries-of-report,"Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team who asked the Justice Department to send Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""within the boundaries"" of the public version of his Russia probe report.

The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s highly anticipated hearing, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” Asked by Fox News why the Monday letter was sent, Barr said Mueller’s staff asked the department for guidance ahead of the hearing.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS MUELLER HIS HOUSE TESTIMONY 'MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES' OF PUBLIC REPORT

“At his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that,” Barr said in an interview. “And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position and they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them [what] our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance that they requested.""

Asked directly if it was Mueller who asked for the letter, Barr replied, “Yes.”

The letter, obtained by Fox News on Monday, was signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

The letter said, “Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ‘not go beyond,’ the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

Speaking to Fox News, Barr also hit back at Nadler, who during a CNN interview Tuesday called the letter “incredibly arrogant” for trying to “instruct” Mueller what to say.

“He was misinformed as to the facts,” Barr said.

The attorney general also declined to comment on the Democratic-controlled House holding him and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over questions having to do with the Trump administration’s proposed citizenship question to the 2020 census.

“Goes with the territory these days,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, Mueller is expected to testify in public before the House Judiciary Committee for two hours or more, followed by another two hours-plus of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Mueller, meanwhile, also has asked that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and his top aide on the Russia investigation, accompany him at the witness table during Wednesday's hearing.

Republicans are opposed to the request. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary panel's top Republican, called the move an ""apparent stunt"" by Democrats. He said it ""shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.""

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation – in May, when he signaled his disinterest in testifying, saying, “There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

Still, Democrats – as some in the party push to impeach President Trump – subpoenaed Mueller to testify.

During his press conference in May, Mueller said there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. But he declined to reach a conclusion over whether the president took steps to obstruct his investigation – something Democrats are expected to focus their questions on Wednesday.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
Op-Ed: Congress should take Mueller’s testimony as a call to action,https://www.latimes.com,"['Corey Dukes', 'Justin Vail']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-23/mueller-testimony-congress-legislation,"Wednesday’s congressional hearings with former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III are unlikely to reveal many new facts, since Mueller has vowed to use only the contents of his report as his “testimony.” But that doesn’t mean his appearance will serve no purpose.

Few members of the public have had the time to study the 448-page Mueller report. Think of Wednesday’s testimony, then, as a sort-of audio book for the rest of us.

The hearings are likely to provide an opportunity for many Americans to learn about details of the Mueller’s investigation they haven’t fully grasped before — about how the Trump campaign welcomed the assistance of a foreign adversary and how the president himself obstructed the government’s probe.

What will matter even more, however, is how Congress responds to the hearings. Mueller’s testimony should set the stage for bipartisan legislative action aimed at securing elections, restoring the rule of law and preventing future abuses of presidential power. The facts of the Mueller report make clear that lawmakers have a job to do, and they should commit to legislative reforms that will get it done.

For practically every offense Mueller uncovered in his investigation, there is a potential legislative remedy. Take, for example, the numerous instances in the report of President Trump’s attempts to interfere with the fair administration of justice to serve his own corrupt purposes.

He asked his FBI director to shut down the investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn, saying, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” He directed White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. And he asked his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to limit the Justice Department’s investigation only to future election interference, insulating Trump and his campaign.

Each of these actions violated the Department of Justice’s independence — a norm that past presidents have generally recognized. Trump’s behavior has made clear that we can’t rely on such norms any longer. We need the department’s independence to be codified. One proposal already under discussion is the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act, which would require White House and Department of Justice staff to report their interactions with each other about specific cases or investigations to department watchdogs and Congress. Logging such communications and subjecting them to review would help deter inappropriate contact between the two offices in the future.

Here’s another example of the kind of legislation the Mueller’s testimony is likely to make clear is needed. His report described several occasions in which Trump dangled pardons that might influence witnesses to testify falsely or refuse to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation. During the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump publicly and repeatedly praised Manafort and refused to rule out a pardon. Trump also told his former lawyer Michael Cohen to “stay strong,” and Cohen discussed the possibility of a pardon with Trump’s personal counsel.

Presidents have wide discretion to grant pardons, with the Constitution broadly stating that they may do so “for offenses against the United States.” But there need to be limits, as the investigation makes clear.

Floating a pardon as a reward for not cooperating with an independent law enforcement probe is obviously corrupt, and not in keeping with the president’s job “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Congress members should take Mueller’s testimony as a reminder they need to act. The Abuse of the Pardon Prevention Act, introduced in 2018, would provide both houses with underlying investigative materials to conduct oversight if a pardon is corrupt or abusive. Congress should pass the law.

These ideas are only part of what should be a broader set of bills to restore the rule of law and strengthen democratic institutions. The House leadership declared recently it intends to pursue legislation to secure elections, which is another crucial issue.

The groundwork for strengthening our democracy has begun to be laid, and Mueller’s testimony on Wednesday can only underscore the need for action. Republicans and Democrats alike must now commit to comprehensive legislation that will ensure the abuses of presidential power uncovered by Mueller and his investigators never happen again.

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/brooklyn-man-accused-of-immigration-fraud-submitting-hundreds-of-faked-applications-doj,"A New York City man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly running an immigration fraud scheme that involved filing over 1,800 fake immigration applications over the past four years, according to a press release from the Department of Justice’s office in Vermont.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont said that Louison filed false statements with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, including more than 1,800 fraudulent applications for over 1,000 petitioners in the last four years.

A less obvious question for Robert Mueller: Why can't a sitting president be indicted?,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/454319-a-less-obvious-question-for-robert-mueller-why-cant-a-sitting-president,"House Democrats today likely will pursue a line of questioning with former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerMueller Day: What to watch for This week: Mueller dominates chaotic week on Capitol Hill Top Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats MORE that will not bear fruit: They want to know whether he would have indicted Donald Trump Donald John Trump Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Protestor yelling about Trump Tower meeting thrown out of Mueller hearing Chris Wallace: 'This has been a disaster for the Democrats' and 'for the reputation of Robert Mueller' MORE for obstruction of justice if the latter were not president. Mueller will repeat what he said in his May 29 public appearance: “Charging the president with a crime was ... not an option” because of a longstanding Department of Justice (DOJ) policy regarding the indictment of a sitting president.

Democrats will lose in this exchange, because they won’t get the answer they seek and will seem to be pushing Mueller past his comfort zone. A variant on that question, however, might provide greater illumination.

House Judiciary Committee members should question Mueller closely about the legal basis for the Justice Department prohibition on indicting a sitting president. This would serve to expose the surprisingly weak foundations of this policy, as well as to identify some of the more far-reaching implications of either abiding by or abandoning it.

ADVERTISEMENT

In his press conference, Mueller said the prohibition is constitutionally mandated, but he declined to comment on what the constitutional principle at work might be. His report on the Russia investigation gives only slightly more detail. It quotes approvingly from the second of two Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memos addressing this question, to the effect that a criminal prosecution of a sitting president could interfere with the impeachment process and that it is therefore inconsistent with the separation of powers.

Apart from this passing reference to separation of powers and constitutional principles, however, the DOJ memos mostly focus on pragmatic, not constitutional, considerations. Indeed, the memos explicitly reject the constitutional interpretation of this question, saying that “the plain terms of the [Impeachment] Clause do not impose such a general bar to indictment or criminal trial prior to impeachment and therefore do not, by themselves, preclude the criminal prosecution of a sitting President.”

This exposes a potential mismatch between Mueller’s explanation for the DOJ policy and the bulk of the explanation offered in the two Justice Department memos. Today’s testimony presents an ideal moment to clarify the policy, and Mueller should not hesitate to answer because the issue is not specific to any particular administration.

What is at stake in the different legal approaches to this question Mueller might take? One critical point is whether it will be possible to preserve any criminal charges for later prosecution against Trump when he no longer is president. Even if Trump does not win reelection, by the time he leaves office the five-year statute of limitations will have run on some of the alleged instances of obstruction, and all the more so if he serves a second term.

Mueller’s position that the prohibition on indicting a sitting president is constitutionally mandated implies presidential immunity to prosecution, and that in turn suggests that the statute of limitations should be tolled during the period of Trump’s presidency. On the other hand, the position that the DOJ policy is based on mere prosecutorial practice implies that the president is not immune to prosecution and that existing prosecutors simply have chosen not to exercise their lawful discretion. The statute of limitations most likely would continue to run on that account, and prosecutors would have lost the opportunity to prosecute Trump for the older instances of obstruction if they continue to adhere to the DOJ policy.

ADVERTISEMENT

So which view of the policy is the right one? There are several obvious difficulties with Mueller’s claim that the principles at stake are constitutional in nature. First, as the later OLC memo itself argues, other federal officers are subject to impeachment, but no one maintains they are similarly immune to prosecution. Second, it is at least theoretically possible for a president to be indicted without being removed from office, as has been explicitly acknowledged in other countries, such as Brazil and Israel.

Following conviction, a president might still have to be impeached to be removed from office. While a convicted president could not run the country effectively, there is no reason to suppose the Constitution forbids this result, as scholars have argued. Given that convicting a president of a crime does not entail removal, the provision of impeachment is at least analytically separate from the question of presidential immunity for criminal acts.

The pragmatic view of the policy against indictment of a sitting president is also problematic, however. On this view, the DOJ policy is not legally mandated, but an accommodation to the pressures on the president and the country’s need for a fully focused commander in chief. It would not constitute a blanket prohibition on indicting a sitting president and therefore would not entail a grant of prosecutorial immunity. On this view, federal obstruction statutes are fully enforceable, and it is therefore unclear why indicting a sitting president should be categorically prohibited.

A third position is sometimes mixed in with the first two, and this is that the mere existence of the OLC memos, regardless of the reasoning they contain, provides a legal basis for a prosecutor to refrain from indicting a sitting president. This position would echo President Obama’s treatment of George W. Bush-era contributors to torture, which he resolved by saying that anyone who had relied upon the (now withdrawn) OLC memos blessing the torture program would not face prosecution.

Today’s hearings would render a great service by making clear that any such view of OLC memos is indefensible. A congressionally mandated statute must prevail over an advisory opinion of an executive branch agency if there is a conflict between the two. OLC opinions are not law; they are interpretations of law, interpretations that a federal prosecutor might feel compelled to ignore in certain circumstances.

ADVERTISEMENT

As Mueller should make clear, the best explanation for his decision not to indict the president of obstruction of justice is that as special counsel he regarded himself as bound to follow OLC guidance, not because he was statutorily or constitutionally obligated to do so. He might have taken a different course, however, and another federal prosecutor might yet.

When should a federal prosecutor ignore the standard advice regarding indicting a sitting president? The short answer is: when there is no other way to stop such a president from corruptly misusing the powers of his office to shield himself from accountability. Such a prosecutor might be bucking DOJ tradition, but what hangs in the balance ultimately might be more important for defending the rule of law.

State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, questions Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on September 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik, Pool/Getty Images

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

"Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges",https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/food-stamp-crackdown-usda-3625454,"The Trump administration's proposed rule would cut 3.1 million people from the SNAP food stamps program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images agriculture Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges

The Agriculture Department acknowledged Tuesday that its latest push to cut back on who is eligible for food stamp benefits may worsen food insecurity in the U.S.

The Trump administration has just released a proposed rule seeking to rein in what's known as broad-based categorical eligibility. That policy has allowed 43 states to expand the number of low-income people who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

Story Continued Below

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the policy is a ""loophole"" that needs to be closed because it's allowed states to bypass ""important eligibility guidelines.""

In a cost-benefit analysis, USDA estimates that tightening the policy would cut 3.1 million people from the program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. The department also clearly states that the proposed change ""may also negatively impact food security.""

According to USDA, nearly 12 percent of U.S. households are already food insecure, which means they do not always have access to enough food as a result of a lack of resources.

The proposal is part of a broader Trump administration bid to cut federal aid programs, something conservatives have long argued is necessary as the federal deficit grows.

Broad-based categorical eligibility allows states to confer SNAP eligibility to households if they're receiving some kind of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The option allows states to get around the typical asset limits and expands the income limits for SNAP in some cases.

For example, the typical gross income limit for SNAP is 130 percent of the federal poverty level. That comes out to be about $27,000 for a family of three.

By using broad-based categorical eligibility, many states are able to offer SNAP benefits to households with gross income of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $42,000 for a family of three.

""Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” Perdue said in a statement released as part of the announcement. “The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity — just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities.""

The department now wants to have the expanded eligibility option for states only if the household is receiving a TANF benefit such as subsidized employment, work supports or child care benefits.

USDA acknowledges that millions could lose assistance if the eligibility rule is changed, potentially worsening hunger among many low-income households.

""The proposed rule may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility,"" the department says in its impact analysis.

USDA estimates that about 9 percent of SNAP households would no longer qualify for the program.

The department also estimates that more than 13 percent of all SNAP households with elderly members would lose benefits.

""The proposed rule is relatively less likely to affect households with children — only 7.4 percent are expected to no longer meet eligibility requirements,"" the department said.

The plan would also hurt grocery retailers, according to USDA. The total loss in SNAP benefits would be $3 billion per year, which would be a hit to business at large and small retailers alike, the department said.

For a small retailer, the potential benefit loss might make up less than 5 percent of their typical SNAP business, USDA said.

House Republicans had sought a similar crackdown on broad-based categorical eligibility during the 2018 farm bill debate, but the changes were rejected in the final bipartisan deal.

Anti-hunger advocates and Democrats on Capitol Hill blasted the administration on Tuesday over the proposal, arguing that USDA is essentially going around Congress to enact a policy lawmakers already rejected.

""It is yet another attack on hungry Americans that ignores the clearly stated will of Congress,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), chairwoman of the House Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee.

""The ugly truth no one in this administration wants to admit is this: The economy isn’t working for our most vulnerable,"" Fudge added. ""They still need a hand up, not a heartless, mean-spirited policy.”"

"Bill Wehrum, an Architect of E.P.A. Rollbacks, Faces New Ethics Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/climate/william-wehrum-epa-inquiry.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum. (The law firm is now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. The Utility Air Regulatory Group announced in May that it would disband after winding down operations.)"

The new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) bill introduced Tuesday directly challenges both an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policy implemented earlier this year and a June Supreme Court ruling.

The Open and Responsive Government Act of 2019 comes a day after the same group of senators

penned a letter

The Hill was the first to report on the rule released at the end of June that, among other things, expands the number of political appointees who can approve or deny FOIA requests. The agency argued the rule did not have to be subject to a public comment period and that the changes were not substantial.

The senators argued the EPA rule would give political appointees, including the administrator, unnecessary power to issue final determinations on whether to release or withhold documents by claiming records were ""non-responsive,"" meaning they didn't meet the criteria requiring them to be released.

The FOIA bill directly eliminates any agency’s authority to withhold any public documents under a basis of non-responsiveness.

“This section does not authorize the withholding of a portion of an otherwise responsive record on the basis that the portion is non-responsive; and is not authority to withhold information from Congress,” a section of the bill reads.

The EPA on Monday in a statement to The Hill said the agency ""has no plans to withdraw the finalized rule.""

""As we have said this rule will enhance transparency and efficiency of responses to FOIA requests. Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible,"" EPA spokesperson Michael Abboud said.

The EPA did not offer a new statement Tuesday.

The bill also addresses the recent Supreme Court decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader, which overturned nearly 40 years of FOIA precedent.

At the end of June, the Supreme Court issued a blow to FOIA advocates, ruling that private businesses did not have to divulge proprietary information under FOIA requests, regardless of whether there was any anticipated harm from the release.

“The new Open and Responsive Government Act of 2019, introduced today, is intended to put the public’s interest ahead of corporate interests by restoring the public’s access to data the government collects from private companies,” a press release for the bill read.

""The people’s business ought to be available to the people. It’s only through public oversight and transparency that we ensure government programs are operating as intended, without any waste, fraud, or abuse. Transparency is something worth fighting for, and it seems we’re always in an uphill battle to keep the sunlight shining on government,"" Grassley said in a statement Tuesday.

""This balanced and bipartisan bill responds to recent court rulings and regulatory actions, restoring pro-transparency principles and making crystal clear where Congress stands on the public’s right to know,"" he added.

Grassley took to the Senate floor in late June to blast what he saw as a chipping away at the public records law, promising a new FOIA bill was forthcoming.

“In a self-governed society, the people ought to know what their government is up to,” Grassley said. “Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access.""

Open the Government, a government accountability group that worked closely with the lawmakers to draft the bill, said it was necessary “to counter the series of onslaughts against FOIA.”

“In the Argus Leader case the Supreme Court tilted the scale in favor of secrecy and away from accountability. At the same time, federal agencies are abusing FOIA exemptions to the detriment of the public,” said Lisa Rosenberg, executive director of Open the Government.

“This legislation is a necessary course correction that will help address waste and corruption while making it easier for public interest organizations and journalists to access information in the way FOIA intended,” she added.

Drafters of the bill expect it is just the first of two FOIA bills lawmakers will work on to address issues within the current law. Some involved say they also anticipate work on a broader FOIA reform bill that would address more of the political issues inherent in some of the agency's newest FOIA policies.

The Interior Department has similarly come under fire for proposing an FOIA policy last December during the partial government shutdown that would grant political officials the ability to see documents related to them before being released to the public in a process called an “awareness review.” That rule has not been yet been finalized.

""We will definitely continue to work with them on a broader reform bill that will strengthen FOIA just as the 2016 FOIA Improvement Act strengthened the original bill. That was a herculean process that took years and transparency and accountability groups advocating that FOIA needed to be enhanced,"" said a spokesperson for one of the groups involved.

The representative said the bill was drafted the way it was, without reference to a political awareness review, to address what Senators considered ""emergency points.""

""The senators rightfully believe this is urgent and ought to be introduced before the recess and not after given the unpredictability of the political environment we find ourselves,"" the spokesperson said."
Lindsey Graham says his 'deep dive' investigation of DOJ and FBI will include Papadopoulos testimony,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-his-deep-dive-investigation-of-doj-and-fbi-will-include-papadopoulos-testimony,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that his “deep dive” into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation would include testimony from former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with the mysterious Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016.

Papadopoulos was swept up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and he ultimately pleaded guilty about lying to investigators.

Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said his committee “will be looking at the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.”

“We will call Papadopoulos and we will find out what happened,” Graham promised.

Graham said he would wait until the completion of the investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The allegations of abuse are related to the Justice Department and the FBI using a salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to surveil a member of the Trump campaign.

Steele had been hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Come law firm, facts which were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority, and Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to be his right-hand man in a separate inquiry into why and how the Justice Department and the FBI launched an investigation into Trump.

“We’ll wait on Mr. Horowitz to do his report about the FISA warrant abuse,” Graham said. “But we’ll take a deep dive into the 2016 surveillance by the FBI and other organizations and campaigns to make sure we know what we’re doing and that there are protocols in place to ensure that we don’t play politics with the law.”

In recent days, Graham has been shedding more light on what his own follow-up investigation is going to look like, saying last week that he had questions for former FBI Director James Comey about his handling of the dossier, for former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about the importance of the dossier in the FISA applications, and for Papadopoulos about whether he was really trying to make inroads with the Russians.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served just 12 days in federal prison late last year. He is now on supervised release.

""I’m going to deep-dive into how this stuff started,” Graham said last weekend. “How could it go so far if there was no collusion?” Graham said that the probe by the Justice Department and the FBI into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that began under President Obama was a “politicized investigation.”"
Department of Labor Opinion: Driver Sleeper Berth Off-Duty Time Need Not Be Compensated,https://www.ttnews.com,"['Eric Miller', 'Staff Reporter']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.ttnews.com/articles/department-labor-opinion-driver-sleeper-berth-duty-time-need-not-be-compensated,"[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

The U.S. Department of Labor has clarified that the time drivers spend in sleeper berths does not count as compensable time, unless they are actually performing work or are on call.

The decision was outlined in an opinion letter, written July 22 by DOL Wage and Hour Division Administrator Cheryl Stanton, based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

She said that past guidance by the department’s Wage and Hour Division has been “unnecessarily burdensome for employers.”

Stanton

Stanton wrote that her opinion “adopts a straightforward reading of the plain language under which the time drivers are relieved of all duties and permitted to sleep in a sleeper berth is presumptively non-duty sleeping time and non-working time when the employer permits the employee to sleep in adequate facilities.”

The presumption that nonworking time in which the employee is relieved of all duties is not compensable holds true regardless of whether the truck is moving or stationary, Stanton said.

American Trucking Associations said the opinion will help the industry better understand its compliance obligations prospectively, rather than settling such matters only after the fact through “costly and wasteful litigation.”

“ATA commends Acting Secretary [Patrick] Pizzella and Administrator Stanton for adopting a straightforward, plain-language reading of the law, rather than the burdensome alternative interpretation embraced by those outlier decisions,” Chris Spear, the federation’s president, said July 22.

“This opinion, which is consistent with decades-old DOL regulations, the weight of judicial authority, and the long understanding of the trucking industry, clears up confusion created by two recent court decisions that called the compensability of sleeper berth time into question.”

Spear was referring to previous court decisions by federal district judges in Arkansas and Arizona that truck drivers are entitled to compensation for time in the sleeper berth. However, those decisions were preceded by two federal cases that resulted in legal rulings more favorable for carriers, including one that was affirmed by an appeals court.

Pianka

“This isn’t a regulation. This is just agency guidance,” added Richard Pianka, ATA’s deputy general counsel. “This is DOL’s view of what the law means.”

However, Pianka told Transport Topics the opinion can be expected to be very influential in court challenges on driver sleeper-berth pay issues.

“A court does not have to give this dispositive weight,” Pianka said. “But they will give it serious consideration and they will not reject it out of hand.”

Pianka continued, “We’re hoping that this opinion letter will clear up the confusion and keep outliers confined, as opposed to spreading further, and that this wave of class-action liability will simmer down.”

Andy Scott, an attorney with Atlanta law firm Fisher & Phillips LLP, who does work for trucking companies, said these cases were just starting to gather strength.

“This new opinion is going to nip that trend in the bud,” he said. “It will probably make it easier to win the cases that are currently underway.”"

The rank hypocrisy of Trump’s treatment of the national debt as president,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Philip Bump', 'National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics', 'July At Pm']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/rank-hypocrisy-trumps-treatment-national-debt-president/,"Exactly eight years to the day before President Trump announced that he would agree to a deal increasing spending and lifting the debt ceiling, Trump decided to highlight President Barack Obama’s budget hypocrisy.

""Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally."" - US Senator @BarackObama, 2007 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2011

That was what Obama said in 2006, the 2011 version of Trump pointed out — yet here Obama was, overseeing one of the largest expansions of the debt in history! Can you believe it?

In fact, on at least 190 days from 2011 until the 2016 election, Trump complained about the size of the annual deficit or the overall debt, according to a Washington Post analysis of Factba.se’s archive of Trump comments.

Those comments were clustered: A lot as the 2012 election loomed and Trump was boosting Mitt Romney’s presidential candidacy. A lot as the 2016 campaign approached and Trump mentioned the issue frequently to disparage Democratic leadership.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

What’s he done since? Well, he’s added to the debt consistently. Granted, the growth of the national debt has been slower under Trump (in both dollars and percentage) than it was under Obama. But then, Obama was also spending federal money to combat the effects of the recession.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

If we look at the growth of the debt during the last few years of Obama’s presidency, the picture is different. Over the equivalent time period in Obama’s second term compared with Trump’s current one, the two presidents oversaw an accrual of debt that’s about even.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

It’s not just that Trump disparaged the debt when Obama was president. He often did so in ways that hyped his own ability to deal with the problem or disparaged Obama in particularly personal ways. He disparaged Republicans for allowing the debt ceiling to be raised and criticized them for not using the debt ceiling for leverage.

Some examples:

Congress is back.TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2011

On Monday, Trump agreed to raise the debt limit without “containing” spending.

That, despite having once tweeted this:

I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2013

He also liked to compare the ballooning debt with Obama’s purported profligacy.

With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation. Just plain wrong. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2011

As president, Trump has spent at least $64 million traveling to Mar-a-Lago alone — with debt topping $22 trillion. At another point, he complained about the cost of a $1 million trip taken by Michelle Obama, a figure that’s less than a third of a Mar-a-Lago jaunt.

In an extended tweet, Trump disparaged Obama personally as he mocked the president’s raising of the debt ceiling.

“He is destroying our country: @BarackObama has requested to raise our debt limit to over $16.4Trillion by the end of his first term. @BarackObama himself said he was lazy. For a lazy person he certainly has done a lot of destruction to our country.""

He repeatedly pointed out Obama’s apparent hypocrisy in opposing increases in the debt.

Bush was called ""unpatriotic"" by @BarackObama in '07 for adding $4T to debt http://t.co/j02vneW0 @BarackObama increased it $6T in 3 years. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2012

Trump has increased it more than $2 trillion in 2½ years.

At one point, he explained to someone on Twitter how long it would take him to fix the debt.

""@AdrianDemers: @realDonaldTrump if you were the President how long would it take for you to erase the U.S. Debt Deficit?"" Not very long! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2013

At another point, he said that getting the country out of debt would be “easy.” The day before he announced his candidacy for the presidency, another retweet.

""@TimWByrd: DonaldTrump i have so much faith in you that if you ran for president I know your the only one who could get America out of debt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2015

During the debt crisis in Greece, Trump predicted that the United States would be next.

“When you hit $24 trillion, and we’re going to be there very soon, because it’s building up very quickly . . . when we hit that $24 trillion number, we become Greece on steroids,” he said in August 2015. “I mean, we have a lot of problems in this country.”

The United States is on pace to hit $24 trillion by the end of 2020.

During the campaign, he offered a lot of ways in which he would reduce the debt, like growth in the economy or expanded energy production. Needless to say, these plans have either not come to fruition or have not reduced the debt significantly.

In May 2014, Trump disparaged the state of the country in terms that would probably have inspired fury if said now by a Democrat in Congress.

Have you ever seen our country look weaker or more pathetic: Snowden, ObamaCare, VA, Russia, jobs, decimated military, debt and so much more — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2014

Included in his complaints? The debt, then about $5 trillion less than it is now.

At other points, Trump used various statistics to demonstrate just how badly Obama was managing the debt. Given that the debt grew substantially during Obama’s first years in office, Trump generally compares favorably with Obama on these metrics — but in each case, the situation has nonetheless gotten worse, not better.

Hope & Change--since @BarackObama has taken office, the US debt has increased by an average of $64K per taxpayer. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2012

Based on a figure of 140.9 million taxpayers (what it was in 2016), the debt has increased by $14,700 per taxpayer under Trump.

Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2012

It’s now about $174,000 per household, up 10.4 percent.

Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2012

Trump has been president for about 1.03 percent of our history (using the signing of the Declaration of Independence as a start date) and has accrued 9.4 percent of the total debt.

Scary & Unsustainable: On Monday the US added more debt than from 1776 through Pearl Harbor http://t.co/fZGWVH5E — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2012

The figure cited in that article for the total debt accrued by the start of World War II is about $91 billion. There have been four days during Trump’s presidency — Sept. 8, 2017; Oct. 2, 2017; Feb. 9, 2018; and Dec. 31, 2018 — when the debt has increased by more than that amount. Generally, this was a function of the debt limit being increased after a debate on Capitol Hill.

At a campaign event in 2016, Trump announced that “the new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.” Since he’s taken office, the increase has been enough to pay off all student debt 1.3 times over.

Then there’s this one.

America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday---coincidence? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2011

Under Trump, it’s never been under that figure.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

There are any number of experiments that would be interesting to conduct if one had access to a portal into alternate dimensions. One would be to see how Trump would have responded on Twitter if the United States had elected a Democrat in 2016 and that person had performed in precisely the same way that Trump has as president.

My guess is that he would not be thrilled."
Esper is sworn in as defense secretary to succeed Mattis,https://wtop.com,"['News Traffic Weather', 'The Associated Press']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/national/2019/07/senate-confirms-army-veteran-mark-esper-secretary-of-defense/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It took seven months, but President Donald Trump on Tuesday finally got a Senate-confirmed secretary of defense…

WASHINGTON (AP) — It took seven months, but President Donald Trump on Tuesday finally got a Senate-confirmed secretary of defense to succeed Jim Mattis.

Mark Esper, an Army veteran and former defense industry lobbyist, won Senate confirmation by a vote of 90-8 and was sworn in at the White House by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in a ceremony attended by Trump and several members of Esper’s family.

“He’s going to be a great one,” Trump said.

Esper’s swearing-in ended the longest period the Pentagon has gone without a confirmed leader in its history.

The turmoil atop the Pentagon began when Mattis stepped down last New Year’s Eve after a series of policy disputes with Trump. He offered to stay two more months to get a successor in place and ensure continuity, but Trump said no.

The president was high on Mattis at the start of his administration. He liked to call the retired Marine general “Mad Dog,” but the affection waned and shortly before Mattis quit Trump referred to him as “sort of a Democrat.”

Even with Esper now in charge, the problem of leadership instability at the Pentagon is not fully resolved. There still is no Senate-confirmed deputy secretary of defense, though David Norquist on Tuesday was nominated for the post and is scheduled to have a confirmation hearing Wednesday. Norquist has been filling in as deputy since January; his regular job is Pentagon budget chief.

The senior leadership vacancies increased again last week with the departure of David Trachtenberg, the Pentagon’s second-ranking civilian policy official.

Beyond that, the No. 2-ranking military officer, Gen. Paul Selva, is retiring Friday as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. No Senate confirmation hearing has been set for the man picked by Trump to replace Selva: Gen. John Hyten, who has been commander of U.S. nuclear forces as head of U.S. Strategic Command.

A military officer has accused Hyten of sexual misconduct . An investigation found insufficient evidence to charge Hyten, but some members of Congress have raised questions about that process. It’s unclear when or whether Hyten’s nomination will proceed.

At his confirmation hearing on July 16, Esper promised that one of his first priorities would be to fix the problem of leadership vacancies.

“I need to staff up the top tier of the Pentagon soonest,” he said.

Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said he believes that in the months since Mattis left, the Pentagon’s sway within the administration has weakened.

“This seems to be the primary challenge that Esper confronts: regaining the power to set the Defense Department agenda and defend it by doing what is best for the nation and the world, not what advances the president’s political agenda,” Tobias said by email.

Esper had been the Army secretary when Mattis resigned in December. On Jan. 1, the deputy defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, became the acting secretary. But after nearly six months as the fill-in, the former Boeing executive abruptly quit .

Esper then became the acting defense secretary, but once he was nominated last week, he had to step aside until after a Senate vote. So, for the past week, the Pentagon had been run by yet another fill-in: Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer.

Esper, who has a wide range of experience in defense matters, including time on Capitol Hill as a congressional staff member, has said he intends to continue the Trump administration’s focus on improving the combat preparedness of the military, nurturing security alliances around the world and reforming Pentagon business practices.

All eight senators who voted against Esper’s nomination are Democrats. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who has sharply criticized Esper for declining to recuse himself from all matters involving his former employer, Raytheon Co., for the duration of his time as defense secretary.

Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he was encouraged by Esper’s confirmation but worried by the continuing problem of vacancies in the Pentagon.

“The complex challenges that we face around the globe are too serious for key positions at the Department of Defense to remain transient,” Smith said. “Instead, our country needs predictable leadership at the Pentagon, capable of withstanding internal political pressure in what has been a historically turbulent administration.”

Esper was a lobbyist for Raytheon, a major defense contractor, for several years before becoming Army secretary. He told Warren that Defense Department ethics officials recommended he not make the recusal commitment she asked about, but pledged to abide by all ethics rules and regulations.

WASHINGTON – The head of President Donald Trump’s accountability and whistleblower protection office at the Department of Veterans Affairs sought to assure lawmakers Tuesday that the office is improving the way it operates.

Tamara Bonzanto, who took over as assistant VA secretary overseeing the office in January, said she and VA Secretary Robert Wilkie ""understand the sense of urgency to improve operations"" and her staff is ""actively working"" to implement changes to “better protect whistleblowers.""

The VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection has been under investigation by the VA inspector general for months and has been criticized for allowing VA supervisors accused of wrongdoing to participate in investigations of the allegations. Advocates for VA employees who have tried to blow the whistle on wrongdoing have accused the office of investigating and retaliating against them instead.

""The Secretary and I value all VA employees and whistleblowers and their commitment to improving care and services for Veterans,"" Bonzanto said in a statement submitted to the House VA Committee ahead of a hearing on whistleblower treatment at the agency.

""The Secretary and I want VA to be a place where employees are encouraged to raise concerns about our operations and can trust that management will take allegations of wrongdoing seriously and that they will not face retaliation for raising those concerns.""

She listed several improvements she is implementing, including ensuring better and more timely communication with whistleblowers and that the office “directly investigates” allegations of retaliation for speaking out about problems.

""This mitigates the possibility that whistleblowers may face retaliation for making a lawful disclosure,"" Bonzanto said.

Trump created the office by executive order in April 2017 and signed a law making it permanent later that year. The office is tasked with receiving complaints from VA employees, investigating and tracking them, and then recommending discipline if warranted.

Bonzanto said she is working to get other functions up and running, including a system to track recommendations made by the inspector general and government accountability office and make sure they are implemented.

VA Inspector General Michael Missal has said that as of March 31, the VA had not addressed 133 recommendations for improvements for more than a year. The GAO testified in May that the VA hadn’t implemented roughly 70% of more than 1,200 recommendations for improvements in reports dating to 2000.

The GAO has kept the VA on its “high-risk” list since at least 2015 because of “longstanding management challenges.”

The VA accountability office said in a report submitted to Congress and obtained by USA TODAY that officials hope to staff up a compliance division that would monitor such recommendations beginning in October.

The division would also analyze complaint data and oversight recommendations in an effort to spot trends by facility or healthcare area and issue reports to the secretary.

In fiscal 2018, which ended October 31, the office had received 1,965 reports, including alleged violations of laws or rules, gross mismanagement or danger to health and safety. The office referred all but 325 of them to other VA offices for investigation.

EPA to phase-out Freon in 2020 and replace it with Puron

SIOUX FALLS, SD— There is a change in the air.

Beginning January 1st, the EPA will phase-out the refrigerant R-22, better known as Freon.

Instead, it’ll be replaced by Puron or R410A.

Experts say it’s more environmentally friendly.

“The ozone depletion level of R410A was much less than R22. So, it acted as a refrigerant to replace R22,” said Mark Lamb, service manager for Frisbee’s.

According to Lamb, the air conditioning industry has been preparing for the change for about 5 years.

With R22 being phased out, the price of the refrigerant is going to increase significantly.

“If you have a component built with the R22 system, you’re always going to have to replace R22 back in the system. It’s going to be a much higher cost than R410A,” said Lamb.

In order to tell which refrigerant your air conditioner takes, that can be found on the side of the unit.

Meanwhile, switching to the new system could cost anywhere between $3,000 to $5,000.

But Lamb says that’s still the cheaper route.

Whatever option you choose, you don’t want to mix Freon and Puron.

“At that point, if that did happen and your refrigerants did mix, we would have to take it to a refrigerant recycling company, and they have to actually destroy the refrigerant because they can’t separate,” said Lamb.

If you aren’t sure which refrigerant you have, you should reach out to an HVAC service provider for help."
Column: Trump has turned the Department of Labor into the Department of Employer Rights,https://www.latimes.com,"['Business Columnist', 'Pulitzer Prize-Winning Journalist Michael Hiltzik Writes A Daily Blog Appearing On Latimes.Com. His Business Column Appears In Print Every Sunday', 'Occasionally On Other Days.']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-22/trump-attack-on-labor,"No advocates for workers’ rights or labor were especially surprised last week when President Trump nominated Eugene Scalia for secretary of Labor, succeeding the utterly discredited Alex Acosta.

Scalia — son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — had made his reputation in Washington as a lawyer for big corporations resisting labor regulations, after all.

He had helped Walmart overturn a Maryland law mandating minimum contributions by big employers for workers’ healthcare, defended SeaWorld against workplace safety charges after a park trainer was killed by an Orca (he lost that case), and had written extensively against a federal regulation expanding ergonomic safety requirements.

But Scalia’s appointment is best seen not in the context of his own legal career, but in the context of Trump’s assault on worker rights and welfare. Despite his positioning himself during his presidential campaign as a flag carrier for the working class, Trump has rolled back numerous pro-worker regulations from the Obama era and before.

He talked a good game about bringing back manufacturing and coal jobs, but that hasn’t materialized. His steel tariffs are credited with saving some 12,000 steel manufacturing jobs, but at the enormous cost to the economy of an estimated $900,000 per job.

That’s paid by steel users, including automakers and other manufacturers. General Motors says it took a $1-billion hit in 2018 from the tariffs. That contributed to its decision to shed 14,000 jobs globally and to shutter its assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, costing 900 jobs. Although Trump attacked GM Chief Executive Mary Barra for the decision, he also turned his ire on UAW and AFL-CIO leaders, calling them “not honest people” and blaming high union dues for the Lordstown closing. (Union dues are paid by workers, not employers.)

Hourly wages for rank-and-file workers are up since Trump’s inauguration, but only at a measly rate after inflation. Wages rose about 3.1% in June over a year earlier, but with consumer inflation running at 1.6% during the same period, the real gain for workers was a mere 1.1% in a year. Workers’ share of economic growth remains dismally low and continues to fall under Trump.

The real hubs of Trump’s attack on workers are the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board. These bodies were established to protect worker rights. As we’ve reported before, under Trump they’ve become the advance guard in eviscerating those rights. Through those agencies, writes Pedro Nicolaci Da Costa of the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, “Trump is pursuing the most hostile anti-labor agenda of any modern president.”

Under Acosta, the Department of Labor rolled back a rule proposed by the Obama administration expanding overtime pay to thousands of workers misleadingly designated as “supervisors.” The Obama rule would have raised the pay threshold under which workers would be guaranteed overtime pay to $47,476 from $26,660, where it had settled for more than a decade. Trump’s labor regulators propose fixing it at $35,000, reducing the number of covered workers in half, leaving behind about 6 million workers who would have been covered under the Obama proposal.

Labor's share of the economy has kept falling under Trump (Federal Reserve of St. Louis)

As Terri Gerstein, a labor expert at Harvard Law School, observed in March, the Trump proposal would work out to less than $17 an hour — not exactly what most would consider “supervisor” pay — and would be silent on fast-food chains’ habit of suspiciously loading up their restaurant workforces with “general managers, assistant managers, night managers, managers for opening and closing and delivery, all paid a weekly salary.”

Trump’s NLRB has reversed the board’s trend toward expanding the definition of “joint employer,” which would have made big franchisers such as McDonald’s jointly liable with their franchisees for violations of employees’ wage and hour rights. Its proposed definition would narrow the joint-employer standard “to the point at which many workers would find it nearly impossible to bring all firms with the power to influence their wages and working conditions to the bargaining table,” according to the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute.

The Trump administration also has rescinded the Obama-era “persuader” rule, which required employers to disclose their relationships with union-busting law firms. The Labor Department has indicated it will take a hands-off approach to enforcing workplace regulations when employees have agreed to bring workplace disputes to arbitration. That drew an objection from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who observed that affected workers often have been “forced to sign away important legal rights” and therefore are “most in need of federal protection.”

That brings us back to Eugene Scalia, who would be almost certain to continue Acosta’s policies, which included fighting legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from its woefully outdated $7.25. Scalia’s career has demonstrated his affinity with employers and bankers; back in 2012, the Wall Street Journal labeled him one of the financial industry’s “go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.”

His 2000 campaign against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s effort to impose more responsibility on employers for ergonomic-related worker injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome gives a good taste of his approach. In an essay for the Cato Institute he lamented that the rule would “require businesses to slow the pace of production, hire more workers, increase rest periods and redesign workstations or even entire operations.” He asserted that OSHA’s intention to expand the rule to home-based work for employers reflected Democrats’ intention to “court union leaders” ahead of the coming presidential election.

The Trump administration is full to the brim of pro-employer front persons. The last place another one is needed is the Department of Labor. Scalia’s appointment to that agency, which is expected to be waved through by the Republican-controlled Senate, will merely continue a void in worker rights in Washington."
Justice Department investigating whether Utah A.G.'s Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.ksl.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Jul']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46599809/justice-department-investigating-whether-utah-ags-office-falsely-obtained-federal-grants,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says.

Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/454156-using-the-va-mission-act-to-justify-raising-federal-spending,"Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanding that an additional $22 billion above current federal spending levels be included in any deal to raise the debt limit in order to pay for new private health care options created by the VA MISSION Act - the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care reform law signed by President Donald Trump Donald John Trump Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Protestor yelling about Trump Tower meeting thrown out of Mueller hearing Chris Wallace: 'This has been a disaster for the Democrats' and 'for the reputation of Robert Mueller' MORE but which was opposed by Pelosi. This requested increase comes in spite of the fact the 2019 VA budget is just under $200 billion under current non-defense spending levels, which is more than double what the VA budget was over a decade ago. The extraordinary increase in the VA budget has far outpaced the growth of patients and beneficiaries and has occurred during a decline in the overall veteran population.

Ensuring veterans get the care and benefits they earned is a critical part of the social contract our country has made with those who put their lives on the line in our defense. It is therefore vital to our national security to have a properly funded VA. But there is a difference between providing the resources the VA needs to accomplish its mission and raising federal budget levels to spend billions more on the VA without a meaningful assessment of whether those additional funds are needed.

Unfortunately, Congress has too often taken the latter approach, to the detriment of veterans and American taxpayers alike.

In 2014, it was revealed that veterans across the country were dying on secret lists while waiting for VA health care. Some ardent defenders of the VA claimed the long wait times for care were a result of lack of funding. But the Obama administration had massively increased the VA’s budget in the previous five years – growing more than $50 billion from 2009 to 2014. In the aftermath of the 2014 scandal, Congress passed and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaConservative former NFL player says Trump met with him to discuss 'black America' Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers Trump struggles to win over voters reaping economic boom MORE signed into law a measure that gave the VA another $15 billion increase. In subsequent years the VA budget would continue to grow, reaching its current level of nearly $200 billion.

Despite the influx of resources, veterans continued to die on wait lists and receive poor quality care. The reason is simple: Congress and prior presidential administrations refused to thoroughly address systemic issues within the VA that wasted money and hindered its health care delivery. They chose the easier path of just writing the VA a bigger check.

For example, as of 2017, most of the VA’s medical facilities were more than 50 years old. Considering the shrinking size and changing demographics of the veteran population, most of these facilities are not in the best locations to provide the best and most convenient care. Many VA hospitals are operating either at significant under-capacity or over-capacity. For primarily political reasons, Congress prevented the VA from shifting infrastructure resources to account for this dynamic. Instead, the agency has been forced to spend billions maintaining aging and underutilized facilities.

Fortunately, the VA MISSION Act included provisions mandating the VA undertake an infrastructure review to ensure that funds for facilities are spent to best serve veterans and not wasted on unnecessary or outdated buildings. Additionally, the law consolidated the VA’s community care programs and greatly expanded health care choice for veterans. Unlike many past efforts effort to reform the VA, the VA MISSION Act took a different approach then just simply spending more money – it fundamentally changed how the VA delivers health care to veterans.

The current overall federal spending levels provide more than enough budgetary flexibility to pay for any additional expenses incurred by the implementation of the VA MISSION Act. Further raising spending levels to provide additional money for the already-funded VA MISSION Act, as Pelosi is demanding, would set a bad precedent while also disincentivizing further reforms within the VA that would reduce waste and improve care for our veterans.

No one wants to shortchange those who sacrificed in service of our country. But as recent history has shown, simply dumping more money into the VA without real reform serves neither our veterans nor taxpayers. With a $22 trillion national debt posing a growing threat to our national security, additional unnecessary spending puts at risk the future of the very country our veterans fought to defend.

Trump expands fast-track deportation authority across U.S.,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'The Associated Press']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/22/trump-expands-fast-track-deportation-authority-across-us/23775627/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration is expanding the authority of immigration officers to deport migrants without requiring them to appear before judges ahead of deportation.

The Homeland Security Department said Monday that fast-track deportations will apply to anyone in the country illegally less than two years.

Until now those deportations applied online to people caught crossing the U.S. border by land and not entering by boat or plane.

The department says the expansion ""expedited removal"" authority will allow it to more efficiently pursue large numbers of people in the country illegally and promptly remove them.

FBI director lavishes praise on DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-director-lavishes-praise-on-doj-inspector-general,"FBI Director Christopher Wray had nothing but praise Tuesday for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz as the DOJ’s watchdog wraps up his investigation into the bureau’s involvement in alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act related to the Steele dossier.

Wray, who was testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was exceedingly complimentary toward Horowitz, telling Chairman Lindsey Graham that he is “hard-hitting,” “independent,” “objective,” “fair,” “professional,"" and “thorough.”

“I have no reason to doubt the integrity or the quality of the investigation he has underway,” Wray added.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show that the Justice Department and the FBI relied heavily on Steele’s dossier, which made a series of salacious and unverified allegations regarding Trump and Russia. Steele put his research together in 2016 at the behest of Fusion GPS, which had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The FISA Court did not reveal that Steele received funding from a Democratic presidential campaign.

Horowitz launched his inquiry in March of last year, interviewed Steele in June, and will reportedly be releasing his report in late summer or early fall.

Additionally, President Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to be his right-hand man in this effort. Wray indicated that he was willing to cooperate in all of these investigations of the investigators.

“When it comes to the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, is anybody providing kind of a deep-dive on what happened there? Is that part of Mr. Horowitz’s charter?” Graham asked Wray on Tuesday.

“Well, I think I would let Inspector General Horowitz speak for himself about the scope of his investigation. But, as you know, the attorney general is doing a review, or has commissioned some people to do a review, and I think that’s part of his job,” Wray answered. “And it’s part of mine to get some of those questions answered.”"
EPA permits agricultural use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos until at least 2020,https://www.foodsafetynews.com,"['Dan Flynn', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture', 'Bill Marler', 'Francine L. Shaw', 'July', 'Powered By']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/07/epa-permits-agricultural-use-of-the-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-until-at-least-2020/,"The federal Environmental Protect Agency has tossed another petition calling for a ban on the agricultural pesticide chlorpyrifos.

Two years ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt denied requests fo revoke all tolerances or maximum residue levels for food and cancel all chlorpyrifos registrations.

EPA is once again allowing farmers to continue using the pesticide in their fields under strict label instructions for its use. Chlorpyrifos was banned for home use almost 20 years ago. Until then it was used on residential lawns and golf turf as a structural termite control agent.

Farmers have used it to control leafage and ground insects since Dow Chemical first registered it for use in the United States. USDA reports chlorpyrifos assists in growing as many as 50 kinds of crops.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue praised EPA for once again keeping chlorpyrifos available on the farm. “For more than 50 crops, chlorpyrifos is the only line of defense and a cost-effective crop protection tool for farmers,” Perdue tweeted out. “We appreciate the @EPA’s support of American farmers and producers in its commitment to fact-based regulatory oversight of crop protection tools.”

EPA again found the scientific evidence isn’t strong enough to justify completely removing the pesticide from the market. Chlorpyrifos’ registration, however, is coming up for a complete review with a statutory deadline of 2022.

Issues raised in the failed petitioners in the past few years will be a be re-visited during that review, including some research that has linked chlorpyrifos to causing brain damage in children.

Activist groups like Earthjustice, claim the scientific evidence that chlorpyrifos harms children’s brains is “overwhelming.” Whether that damage occurs at the residual levels that might occur in fresh fruits and vegetables is likely another questions.

Those who do want chlorpyrifos banned whether they wish to participate in EPA review, take the issue to federal court or both.

States bans of chlorpyrifos are occurring in New York State and Hawaii. New York’s ban takes effect on Jan. 2, 2020 with use on apple tree trunks extended for an extra year. And Hawaii’s bans the bug killer beginning in 2021. Other states may follow on their own.

EPA’s previous assessment found dietary and drinking water risks for the current uses of chlorpyrifos. But it put off the scientific review of neurodevelopmental effects the 2022 study.

It is possible under the current label uses that chlorpyrifos residues on food crops can exceed the safety standard under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). And there is a risk to workers who mix, load, and apply chlorpyrifos on the fields. Water exposure from both non-food and food use is also a concern.

The Obama administration in October 2015 moved to revoke all food residue tolerances for chlorpyrifos. The action came in response to a petition filed by the National Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America.

USDA and the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture objected to EPA’s methodology. So did the federal Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), which is set up under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

The SAP provides the EPA Administrator with advice on pesticides and pesticide-related issues.

Justice Department investigating whether Utah Attorney General's Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.', 'Romboy Deseretnews.Com']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900080783/utah-attorney-generals-office-false-federal-grants-justice-department-investigation.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says."
Homeland Security’s cuts in counterterrorism programs assailed,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-22/trump-administration-counterterrorism-cutbacks-criticized,"A senior House member said Monday that he will explore legislation to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from diverting funds from critical research and programs on tracking nuclear material that could be used in a terrorist attack.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said that the gutting of programs intended to thwart potential terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction over the last two years was a “dereliction of duty” and has put the nation at greater risk of potential catastrophic attack.

A recently published Times investigative report revealed that multiple WMD-related programs have been cut back sharply or eliminated since 2017 at Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

“Reducing staffing and capabilities to respond to WMD attacks, including nuclear terrorism, is shortsighted at best, and could be devastating in the event of an attack,” Schiff said in a statement.

According to an aide, Schiff is considering a legislative remedy within Homeland Security’s pending congressional appropriation.

Schiff sponsored legislation in 2010 that authorized the creation of the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center at Homeland Security to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

Over the last two years, the center’s leadership has left and its staff has shrunk from about 14 to three, one of multiple shifts and cutbacks in the counterterrorism programs at Homeland Security.

“That the Trump administration is letting that capability wither away ... is a dereliction of duty,” Schiff said in a written statement.

Among the programs affected was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” which previously conducted dozens of drills and assessments each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing dirty bomb.

Another Homeland Security unit had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The unit participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year.

The department’s International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

In an interview Sunday, John Roth, who served as Homeland Security’s inspector general from 2014 to 2017, said that the reported shifts and cutbacks merit congressional scrutiny.

“My recommendation would be rigorous oversight hearings and investigations of what’s going on,” said Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official.

The WMD-related cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, whom President Trump appointed to successive Homeland Security positions in 2017 and 2018.

McDonnell declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed about the changes, and Homeland Security did not answer written questions about the matter. The department didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday regarding Schiff’s remarks.

Roth said he believes the WMD-related developments likely stem from turmoil at the top of Homeland Security. Since taking office, Trump has gone through two secretaries of Homeland Security and the department now is led by an acting secretary.

Several other top-level appointive positions at Homeland Security remain unfilled, including the deputy secretary and the undersecretary for management.

“When you have significant vacancies in key leadership positions,” Roth said, “you’re basically going to get people who do whatever they want, and aren’t being held accountable.”

The Times reported that $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads — went unspent. That should be a “huge red flag” to Homeland Security’s most senior leaders, Roth said.

“Every dollar obligated to one component is unavailable to others,” Roth noted. “I would be asking some hard questions.”"
Austin Housing Authority Buys Private Apartments to Rent to Section 8 Tenants,https://nextcity.org,[],,,,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/austin-housing-authority-buys-private-apartments-rent-to-section-8-tenants,"“The need for this program far exceeds available resources.”

That was how the Housing Authority of the City of Austin put it when it reopened its waitlist for Housing Choice Vouchers last September for the first time in four years. The Housing Choice Voucher program, which was previously known as Section 8, helps low-income families make up the difference between the cost of rent on the private market and what they’re able to afford. In 2014, the last time the Authority opened the waitlist, it got 20,000 applicants. It whittled them down to 2,500 through a lottery. It was expecting to do the same again last year, randomly selecting another 2,000 applicants just to get in the line for a voucher.

But even when a family gets a voucher, says Michael Gerber, president and CEO of the housing authority, they may find it very difficult to find a landlord who will accept it. As Next City has reported before, Texas landlords are allowed to reject tenants based on their source of income. And like a lot of growing cities, Austin is facing a critical shortage of affordable housing across the board, which is especially acute at the lowest end of the income scale.

“While a housing authority I don’t think has a responsibility for fixing all of [the housing shortage], we certainly feel a responsibility to try to address it as best we can,” Gerber says. “It’s hard to say to that resident, ‘Here’s a housing choice voucher. We know you’re not going to be able to use it.’”

So as part of its effort to make more housing available to voucher holders, the housing authority is continuing to expand a strategy of acquiring housing units on the private market and making some of them affordable for low and moderate-income people. Recently, the housing authority, in partnership with the affordable-housing investment group Community Development Trust, bought a 452-unit apartment complex in Southeast Austin, as the Austin American-Statesman reported. The authority is planning to rent the units to tenants earning no more than 80 percent of median family income, which works out to $48,200 for an individual or $68,800 for a family of four. And it’s planning to market at least 15 percent of the units to voucher holders and tenants receiving assistance through HUD’s Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.

The project, called The Bridge at Asher Apartments, is pushing into more valuable real-estate territory than a lot of the Authority’s other projects, Gerber says. It’s adjacent to a growing commercial area, and none of the other properties in that area were accepting housing choice vouchers, according to Gerber. It’s also near high-quality schools, which is why the Kresge Foundation and the National Housing Trust supported the project with a $4 million grant from the HOPE Fund, which helps establish low-income housing near good schools. It’s also a shorter commute to downtown, where the jobs are, Gerber says.

“We’re excited to be there,” Gerber says. “It’s a big property, and it’s a challenging property, but it’s an exciting property for us and it’s getting awfully close to those southern suburbs which are becoming so desirable.”

The Austin Housing Authority recently purchased this property, The Bridge at Asher Apartments, in partnership with Community Development Trust. It will rent the units to families holding Housing Choice Vouchers (also known as Section 8).

Adrianne Todman, CEO of The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), which represents housing authorities and community development agencies, says that most public housing authorities currently focus on preserving the public units in their ownership and building new projects with federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The Housing Authority of the City of Austin has done a good job of acting as a proactive housing provider in the city, Todman says.

“Austin is looked at as one of the most innovative agencies in the country, and it has solid leadership,” Todman says.

In many places, Todman says, city leaders have seen public housing and housing authorities as something that’s outside their purview — “something that’s happening over there,” she says. But as affordable housing becomes an issue that is impacting more people in more places at different income levels, some cities are starting to look to their housing authorities as assets, she says. Some housing authorities — like the King County Housing Authority near Seattle — have been able to acquire housing on the private market and convert or preserve it for lower-income residents.

“For most housing authorities, that is not something that they do, but where it’s being done it’s being done really well,” Todman says. “And one of the goals we have at NAHRO is helping other groups learn how to really become a local player.”

In Austin, the city council and the mayor have also brought a productive focus to issues of housing affordability, Gerber says. This past spring, the city council passed a plan called Affordability Unlocked, which creates incentives in the former of greater density and looser regulations for projects that are geared toward tenants earning less than 60 percent of the median income, as Next City has reported. And last fall, voters approved a $250 million bond intended to finance affordable housing construction and preservation. Those programs dovetail with the housing authority’s acquisition strategy, Gerber says. At another project, the authority was able to use the Affordability Unlocked rules to reduce the number of parking spaces to what it believes the residents there will actually need and expand the amount of green space on the site and the size of a connected community center, Gerber says. And it plans to apply for funds from the most recent housing bond, which it has not done in the past, he says.

Many policies in Austin and elsewhere are focused on incentivizing private developers to construct affordable housing. But public housing authorities serve a group of residents whose needs are greater than the market is likely to ever provide, Gerber says. The typical voucher holder in Austin earns less than $13,000 a year, according to Gerber, and the authority disproportionately serves seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, and people transitioning out of homelessness. Acquiring more property will help it find new ways to serve those people, Gerber says.

“We are a piece of the affordability puzzle in Austin,” he says. “We’re trying to do our part.”"
USDA rule would cut food stamp benefits for 3.1 million,http://www.startribune.com,[],,,,http://www.startribune.com/usda-rule-could-affect-3-1m-food-stamp-recipients/513085372/,"WASHINGTON — About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — ""will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule."" That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it ""may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.""

Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the proposal.

House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was ""the administration's latest act of staggering callousness"" while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would ""fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to ""take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.""

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

""The proposed rule would weaken SNAP's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,"" he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says ""barely participate"" in TANF. The provision is called ""expanded categorical eligibility.""

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don't need it and wouldn't qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should ""put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.""

She said the department didn't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. ""It's another hit on hunger,"" she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for ""preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.""

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days."
Opinion: VA secretary uses religious liberty to delay veterans' claims,https://www.sctimes.com,"['Patricia Wilson', 'Times Writers Group', 'Published P.M. Ct July']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2019/07/22/va-secretary-uses-religious-liberty-delay-veterans-claims-agent-organge-vietnam-korea-court-battle/1796376001/,"CLOSE

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a press release July 5 announcing the extension of Agent Orange claims for “Blue Water Navy” veterans.

Agent Orange was the toxic herbicide used to clear plants and trees in battle zones in Korea and in Vietnam. Vietnam veterans who served offshore of Vietnam between Jan. 9, 1962-May 7, 1975, and veterans who served in or near the demilitarized zone in Korea from April 1, 1968-Aug. 31, 1971 are eligible for benefits.

The 2019 Blue Water Navy Veterans Act was signed into law June 25. According to the VA press release, 420,000 to 560,000 Vietnam veterans may be considered Blue Water Navy Veterans. The law goes into effect Jan 1. Korean War veterans in their late 80s may not live long enough to collect these benefits.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie stated, “VA is dedicated to ensuring that all veterans receive the benefits they have earned.” Wilkie further stated the VA will not begin to process the claims until Jan. 1 “we are working to ensure we have the proper resources in place to meet the needs of our Blue Water Veterans community and minimize the impact on all veterans filing for disability compensation.”

Wilkie fails to mention the VA denied these claims for years, and fought a bitter court battle before Congress could finally pass the bill.

VA benefit claim representatives will not begin to deal with a backlog estimated to be 420,000 to 560,000 claims until Jan. 1 because they do not have to comply until that date.

Wilkie found a cause, which is of such importance, that he issued a press release on July 3 to let the public know the VA is overhauling religious and spiritual symbols to protect the religious liberty of veterans effective immediately.

The reason given for this urgent action by Wilkie is “to make sure that all our veterans and their families feel welcome at VA no matter their religious beliefs.”

In what universe have veterans been beating the doors of their local VA Medical Center and demanding Bibles?

Veterans know every VA medical center has an all-faith chapel or meditation room. A VA may also have a reflection garden, hall of harmony, or corners of meditation, depending on the size of the VA facility. At smaller clinics, VA personnel have a list of local religious leaders to assist a veteran in need of spiritual care.

Like many of my sister and brother veterans, I have spent time in VA waiting rooms to see a health provider. In over 15 years of care from various VA medical centers across the country, I have never witnessed a veteran being upset or on a rant because a Bible was not sitting on a table with the rest of the reading materials.

The waiting room conversations revolve around the weather, what branch of the military you served in and when. Veterans also tend to relate their personal experiences in getting care at the VA and if they have had problems with their benefit claims.

Nothing gets the attention of the public quicker than to mention religion. Wilkie is using this as a distraction from the backlog of claims.

Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal Constitution, in a July 14 article, cited the fact that, “the backlog just to achieve eligibility for VA care is 317,157 claims.”

Veterans know they have religious freedom. We all took the same oath to protect and defend the Constitution, which guarantees that freedom among others. Veterans want their claims for eligibility processed, their disability claims handled in a fair and timely manner, and health care they earned.

When I walk through the doors of Building 1 at the St. Cloud VA, I am not there for a prayer meeting. I am there to receive the best possible health care from one of the better VA centers in the country.

Let us handle our religious beliefs Secretary Wilkie. You get busy and light a fire under the VA to process the paperwork that will grant veterans the care they need now!

This is the opinion of Patricia Wilson, a veteran and a resident of St. Cloud. Her column appears on the fourth Tuesday of the month.

Teacher's union head calls DeVos handling of student loan forgiveness program 'a travesty',https://thehill.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/454303-teachers-union-head-calls-devos-handling-of-student-loan-forgiveness-program-a-travesty,"The head of the teachers union suing the Department of Education is slamming Secretary Betsy DeVos Elizabeth (Betsy) Dee DeVosTeacher's union head calls DeVos handling of student loan forgiveness program 'a travesty' The Hill's Morning Report — Trump applauds two-year budget deal with 0 billion spending hike Democratic senator slams DeVos: 'I think we should send her back' MORE, calling her mismanagement of the public service student loan forgiveness program a “travesty” and a “betrayal” to millions of Americans.

Randi Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, filed a lawsuit earlier this month against DeVos. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is brought by eight union members along with Weingarten and the union itself.

“What Betsy Devos has done is a travesty and a betrayal,” Weingarten, an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s handing of the program, told Hill.TV on Tuesday.

An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment, but called the lawsuit ""nothing more than the typical political grandstanding from the union.""

The federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007.

The program promises to forgive the remaining balance of federal student loan debt for graduates who have made at least 120 payments and work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit. This includes teachers, firefighters and nurses among other public service workers.

Weingarten emphasized that the current program is in such disarray, that it violates both federal law and the Constitution.

“Why are they not actually saying, ‘wait a second’ — you paid for 10 years, we’re going to find every way to get your loan forgiven,'” she said. “Instead it’s obstacle after obstacle after obstacle.”

According to the Education Department’s own data, only 1 percent of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

However, in statement to Hill.TV, a department spokesperson maintained that it has sought to improve its internal process and enhanced outreach by providing automated tools on its website to help people better navigate the program. This includes helping borrowers see whether their employer qualifies for the program and whether they are enrolled in an eligible repayment plan.

The spokesperson added that it has also actively encouraged borrowers to submit a form to access their progress in the program annually or when they change jobs.

""The Department is well on its way to bringing the federal student aid programs into the 21st century,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""Through this transformative effort—Next Gen FSA—we’ll, among other things, offer students, parents, and borrowers personalized communications and outreach through their preferred channel.""

Weingarten accused DeVos of trying to help student loan service providers rather than the borrowers themselves. In October, the American Federation of Teacher filed lawsuit against Navient, which is one of the largest federal student loan servicers in the country.

""Navient said in their motion to dismiss that it doesn’t matter what they say to borrowers like people who have taken out student debt because their contract is with the Department of Education,"" she said. ""So they can lie to borrowers and nobody can actually have a remedy — that’s why we’re going after the Department of Education.""

Weingarten added that DeVos isn’t the only one to blame, saying previous administrations could have taken action and made the program more transparent. But she said it's now up to Congress to act.

“At the end of the day, we have to help people who are paying $500 to a $1,000 a month and they want to be teachers, they want to be firefighters, they want to be nurses and so hopefully we can get some relief from the court,” she told Hill.TV. “But at the same time, we need Congress to make this more transparent and make it easier for people to do this.”

This is not the first time Weingarten has criticized the Trump administration over its handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

In an op-ed endorsing presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann Warren Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Warren presses Pelosi on impeachment: 'Some things are above politics' Overnight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault MORE’s student loan forgiveness plan, she accused the administration of sabotaging the program.

However, she wrote that she was heartened by Warren’s proposal, saying such a plan would be “transformational.”

""Warren’s student debt and universal free college plan would be transformational — similar to the way the GI Bill completely altered Americans’ access to higher education,"" she said, adding that it is good policy for both working- and middle-class Americans but a step in the right direction for the economy.
