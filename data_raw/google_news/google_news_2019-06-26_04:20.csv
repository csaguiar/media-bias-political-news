Jay Sekulow: Obama administration’s anti-Trump actions revealed in newly disclosed documents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Jay Sekulow'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jay-sekulow-obama-administrations-anti-trump-actions-revealed-in-newly-disclosed-documents,"Stunning new information just released by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) shows that the Obama administration stepped up efforts – just days before President Trump took office – to undermine Trump and his administration.

The ACLJ, where I serve as chief counsel, has obtained records that show the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, under Director James Clapper, eagerly pushed to get new procedures as part of an anti-Trump effort. The procedures increased access to raw signals intelligence before the conclusion of the Obama administration, just days before President Trump was inaugurated.

By greatly expanding access to classified information by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, the Obama administration paved the way for a shadow government to leak classified information – endangering our national security and severely jeopardizing the integrity and reputation of our critical national security apparatus – in an attempt to undermine President Trump.

MEADOWS AND JORDAN SAY THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN BARR FINDING THE TRUTH BEHIND INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP

No president-elect or president should be targeted in this manner – and those responsible must be held accountable.

As I told Sean Hannity on his Fox News Channel program, the documents were obtained as a result of one of our Freedom of Information Act lawsuits – this one against the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency.

The documents confirmed what we suspected: the Office of the Director of National Intelligence rushed to get the new “procedures signed by the Attorney General before the conclusion of this administration,” referring to the Obama administration.

We have been working to unearth the facts of this Obama administration anti-Trump effort through our Freedom of Information Act lawsuits for more than two years.

The documents also reveal that Robert Litt, who worked in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense’s Director of Intelligence Strategy, Policy, & Integration: “Really want to get this done ... and so does the Boss.” Presumably “the Boss” is a reference to Director Clapper.

And documents the ACLJ received that were produced by the National Security Agency show that NSA officials discussed that they “could have a signature from the AG as early as this week, certainly prior to the 20th of Jan.” In other words, certainly before President Trump’s inauguration.

Consider what we now know about the nature and degree of Deep State opposition to President Trump.

There have been public revelations about the infamous disgrace known as the Steele dossier, a report by a former British spy funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign that made false and baseless allegations against presidential candidate Trump.

There were also documented abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that led to an FBI investigation – codenamed Crossfire Hurricane – of possible ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller later concluded after an exhaustive investigation lasting nearly two years that the Trump campaign did not conspire with Russia to advance Trump’s election chances.

We are also now aware of Director of National Intelligence Clapper’s open hostility to President Trump and intentional leaking by senior law enforcement and intelligence officials who were also hostile to Trump.

All of these facts point to a coordinated effort across agencies during the Obama administration to oppose the incoming Trump administration.

As part of the ACLJ’s Government Accountability Project and Freedom of Information Act practice, we uncovered key information about the embedded “resistance” operating within our government.

In this particular instance, it concerned us when we heard that, according to The New York Times , “in its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government’s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.”

On December 15, 2016 – after President Trump’s election – Director of National Intelligence Clapper executed a document titled “Procedures for the Availability or Dissemination of Raw Signals Intelligence Information by the National Security Agency Under Section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333.”

On January 3, 2017 – just days before President Trump’s inauguration – then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch executed the document, indicating her approval.

According to The New York Times, “the new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the N.S.A. may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations.”

The New York Times had first reported in 2014 that deliberations by Obama administration officials on developing the new procedures were occurring. But apparently, the new procedures were not completed by the director of national intelligence and approved by the attorney general until just weeks before the end of President Obama’s term.

We have been working to unearth the facts of this Obama administration anti-Trump effort through our Freedom of Information Act lawsuits for more than two years. We will continue to pursue new information about this strategy to embolden the Deep State.

Photo of a dead father and daughter reveals Trump’s immigration policy,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/25/18701106/trump-immigration-migrant-photo,"This is the photo that encapsulates the cruelty of the Trump era: a father and daughter lying dead on the banks of the Rio Grande river, her tiny arm draped around his neck, drowned after an attempt to cross onto American soil and seek asylum.

I don’t like having to look at it, but it’s important: It is the true face of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration, the physical embodiment of the nativism that animates it.

These are the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter, Valeria, who is almost 2.

This image contains sensitive or violent content Tap to display

The backstory behind these photos, as reported by Julia De Luc in the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, is that Oscar and his wife Tania Vanessa Ávalos were attempting to enter the United States from their native El Salvador to exercise their legal right to seek asylum. They were being held in a migrant camp on the Mexican side of the border, a camp that didn’t have enough food while temperatures soared to more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

So they decided to cross the Rio Grande on their own, without permission. At first, Oscar and Valeria made it across. But when Oscar went back in the water to help Tania cross, Valeria — too young to understand what was happening — jumped back in as well. Oscar swam back in to get his daughter, but the current took them both away. Tania could do nothing but watch.

When the photo of Oscár and Valeria’s corpses hit the English-speaking internet on Tuesday afternoon, the nation was primed for outrage. The issue of the Trump administration’s treatment of migrants had dominated the headlines. The acting head of Customs and Border Patrol had just resigned amid an uproar over the horrific conditions in the camps for children that CBP operates. The photo immediately touched a nerve, social media lighting up with rage and sadness.

In immediate policy terms, Oscár and Valeria’s tragedy isn’t directly connected to the conditions in US-operated facilities. One has to do with Trump’s policy surrounding migrant entry into the United States, the other with how to handle migrants once they’re permitted to enter.

But ideologically, the two policies are part of the same whole: They represent the ultimate logical endpoint of an administration that will do whatever it takes to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States.

The policy behind the photo

People can seek asylum in the US in two ways: by presenting themselves at a port of entry, or by crossing the border illegally, then turning themselves into Border Patrol.

But Trump has put severe pressure on Mexico’s leader, Andrés Manuel Lopez Óbrador, to try to interdict migrants from Central America crossing over the US-Mexico border. When you combine this with a significant uptick in Central Americans trying to enter the United States and seek asylum, and Trump’s policy of “metering,” only admitting a certain number of asylum seekers per day, the result is a significant number of people waiting in northern Mexico to try to enter the United States. These people, who are mostly not Mexican citizens, need food and shelter.

So the Mexican government has built its own camps near the border to try to house these people. They are overcrowded, hot, and miserable places, full of people waiting with no sense of when they’ll get to leave. It was predictable that some of them would try to enter the US in other ways. In 2018, as metering took effect and the number of families entering ports of entry without paperwork has held steady or even dropped, the number of families caught crossing between ports of entry skyrocketed.

It was similarly predictable that some of them would die in the attempt.

It’s the utter predictability that this would degenerate into a humanitarian nightmare that connects Oscár and Valeria to the 2,000 kids in CBP’s custody.

In both cases, the Trump administration has engaged in policies that are designed to limit migration, both legal and undocumented, without much attention to the obvious humanitarian consequences, whether they happen to kids in detention without toothbrushes or soap or to thousands of migrants forced to wait for months without any idea of when they might be able to enter the US.

Nativism is, at its core, a proposition about what kinds of people matter. It says that non-Americans are less deserving than Americans are, that a happenstance of birth means that the US government is not required to treat non-citizens as humans with the same intrinsic moral worth as citizens. The nativist is a person who ranks the value of lives.

If one thing that should come out of the deaths of Óscar and Valeria Ramirez, it’s that nobody should be able to deny what that means."
"U.S. Tech Companies Sidestep a Trump Ban, to Keep Selling to Huawei",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Paul Mozur', 'Cecilia Kang']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/technology/huawei-trump-ban-technology.html,"SHANGHAI — United States chip makers are still selling millions of dollars of products to Huawei despite a Trump administration ban on the sale of American technology to the Chinese telecommunications giant, according to four people with knowledge of the sales.

Industry leaders including Intel and Micron have found ways to avoid labeling goods as American-made, said the people, who spoke on the condition they not be named because they were not authorized to disclose the sales.

Goods produced by American companies overseas are not always considered American-made. The components began to flow to Huawei about three weeks ago, the people said.

The sales will help Huawei continue to sell products such as smartphones and servers, and underscore how difficult it is for the Trump administration to clamp down on companies that it considers a national security threat, like Huawei. They also hint at the possible unintended consequences from altering the web of trade relationships that ties together the world’s electronics industry and global commerce."
The totally obvious reason why Donald Trump picked Stephanie Grisham,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/politics/stephanie-grisham-white-house-press-secretary-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is not a complicated guy. He likes people who like him. He hates people who don't like him. And he trusts a very small group of people -- mostly members of his own family and a very few aides who have been with him from the start.

Which is why it makes total and complete sense that Trump picked Stephanie Grisham to be the new White House press secretary and communications director on Tuesday. Grisham has been a member of Trumpworld since the summer of 2015, when she signed on as traveling press secretary. She went on to become a close confidante of not just the President but, just as importantly, first lady Melania Trump -- for whom she has served as communications director. (Grisham is keeping that role even as she takes on a broader West Wing portfolio as well.)

Trump always favors those who have displayed the most loyalty to him but perhaps even more so at this moment -- when he is increasingly unhappy with the advice he has been getting from his various presidential advisers -- including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney"

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"

Judge says Democrats can begin collecting Trump financial records in emoluments suit,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/politics/emoluments-lawsuit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal judge told US House and Senate Democrats they can begin collecting financial evidence this week about Donald Trump's businesses for a lawsuit.

Judge Emmet Sullivan, of the US District Court in Washington, denied an attempt by the Justice Department to stop the Democrats from collecting information from the Trump Organization and to appeal early court decisions in the lawsuit, which tests the constitutionality of Trump's business holdings while he serves as President.

The case is one of several avenues Democrats have to get to Trump's financial records.

Sullivan said the group of more than 200 members can begin collecting evidence June 28 through late September. Previously, the members of Congress said they plan to seek both documents and depositions from the Trump Organization.

But the Justice Department had hoped to take the case to an appeals court before the evidence collection began.

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Omarosa Manigault Newman alleging that the former ""Apprentice"" star who served as an adviser to President Donald Trump before becoming a prominent critic of his administration failed to file a financial disclosure report after she was fired from the White House.

In a civil complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the department said Manigault Newman failed to file the report despite several emails reminding her to do so. Such a report is required of employees who leave government jobs. The Justice Department is seeking a $50,000 penalty against Manigault Newman.

Manigault Newman was unavailable for comment. Her attorney, John Phillips, accused the White House of using the Justice Department to retaliate against Manigault Newman and said allegations that she ""knowingly and willfully"" did not file the disclosure report is untrue.

Phillips said the White House is still in possession of documents that Manigault Newman needed to file the report. He said Manigault Newman repeatedly requested these files from the White House, and told staffers in ""several calls and emails"" that she needed the contents of ""seven boxes"" of documents that were seized after her firing. The White House agreed to provide the documents on May 10, months after the deadline to file the report, but Phillips said Manigault Newman has not received any of the files.

Manigault Newman was assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. Her annual salary was $179,700 a year, the top pay allowed by law for White House aides. Former chief of staff John Kelly fired her in December 2017 after less than a year on the job.

Manigault Newman later published a tell-all book describing the Trump White House as ""the most chaotic, outrageous"" in history. She also revealed that she had secretly recorded a Situation Room conversation in which Kelly fired her, as well as another conversation with Trump afterward.

The former ""Apprentice"" star, who said she worked closely with Trump for more than 15 years before he became president, has since been the subject of presidential insults on Twitter.

Trump tweeted in August 2018 that ""Wacky Omarosa"" ""begged"" him for a job and that White House staffers hated her.

FedEx sues US government over export rules after Huawei shipping problems,https://www.theverge.com,['Jun'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744123/fedex-lawsuit-us-department-of-commerce-ear-export-liability-huawei-shipping-problems,"Delivery company FedEx has sued the US Department of Commerce for requiring it to enforce export bans with extra screening efforts. In a statement, FedEx complained of an unfair and “impossible burden” of liability. “FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,” it says. The suit comes a few days after FedEx mistakenly refused to ship a Huawei phone because of potential legal issues.

FedEx’s complaint says the current Export Administration Regulations violate FedEx’s Fifth Amendment rights. “The language of the EAR imposes a constitutionally unsupportable choice for FedEx,” it says, claiming that FedEx has to either risk legal penalties or refuse to ship any package that seems even slightly risky.

“FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency.”

FedEx CEO Fred Smith told Fox News that Huawei shipping errors were emblematic of an ongoing problem, with export controls creating “confusing situations” that tarnish the company’s reputation.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took issue with FedEx’s interpretation of the law. The regulation, he said, only meant that carriers like FedEx “cannot knowingly ship items” that are banned by export controls. “It does not require a common carrier to be a policeman or to know what’s in every package,” he told Fox.

FedEx has been accused of violating export controls before, though. The Department of Commerce fined it for shipping packages to a banned recipient between 2011 and 2012, saying FedEx “knew or should have known” its screening system missed slight variations of the company name. FedEx settled last year for more than $500,000. Conversely, the Chinese government recently said it’s investigating FedEx for misrouting some Huawei parcels, so erring on the side of caution can cause its own problems.

The government has placed several restrictions on US companies dealing with Huawei, partly because of an ongoing trade war with China and partly because of unclear security threats. There’s no blanket ban on transporting Huawei products, but FedEx argues that under the current regulations, its employees are likely to make mistakes in the name of avoiding legal trouble."
"FTC, Justice Dept. takes coordinated action against robocallers – TechCrunch",https://techcrunch.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/ftc-justice-department-robocall-action/,"Federal authorities have announced its latest crackdown on illegal robocallers — taking close to a hundred actions against several companies and individuals blamed for the recent barrage of spam calls.

In the so-called “Operation Call It Quits,” the Federal Trade Commission brought four cases — two filed on its behalf by the Justice Department — and three settlements in cases said to be responsible for making more than a billion illegal robocalls.

Several state and local authorities also brought actions as part of the operation, officials said.

Each year, billions of automatically dialed or spoofed phone calls trick millions into picking up the phone. An annoyance at least, at worse it tricks unsuspecting victims into turning over cash or buying fake or misleading products. So far, the FTC has fined companies more than $200 million but only collected less than 0.01% of the fines because of the agency’s limited enforcement powers.

In this new wave of action, the FTC said it will send a strong signal to the robocalling industry.

Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Americans are “fed up” with the billions of robocalls received every year. “Today’s joint effort shows that combatting this scourge remains a top priority for law enforcement agencies around the nation,” he said.

It’s the second time the FTC has acted in as many months. In May, the agency also took action against four companies accused of making “billions” of robocalls.

The FTC said its latest action brings the number of robocall violators up to 145.

Several of the cases involved shuttering operations that offer consumers “bogus” credit card interest rate reduction services, which the FTC said specifically targeted seniors. Other cases involved the use of illegal robocalls to promote money-making schemes.

Another cases included actions against Lifewatch, a company pitching medical alert systems, which the FTC contended uses spoofed caller ID information to trick victims into picking up the phone. The company settled for $25.3 million. Meanwhile, Redwood Scientific settled for $18.2 million, suspended due to the inability for defendant Danielle Cadiz to pay, for “deceptively” marketing dentistry products, according to the FTC’s complaint.

The robocalling epidemic has caught the attention of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms and internet industries. Last month, its commissioners proposed a new rule that would make it easier for carriers to block robocalls."
Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images, FILE

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

Morgan declined to address the alleged stand-down order from McAleenan, saying it would not be ""appropriate"" for him to talk about ""privileged"" discussions with McAleenan or the White House.

DOJ urges definitive ruling from SCOTUS on census citizenship question,https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/scotus-citizenship-census-1554720,"Before the Justice Department’s latest salvo, civil rights groups celebrated the order from the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit as an indication that their arguments against the citizenship question were gaining traction. | Michelle R. Smith/AP Photo employment & immigration DOJ urges definitive ruling from SCOTUS on census citizenship question

The Trump administration made an unusual last-minute plea to the Supreme Court Tuesday, telling the justices that actions by lower courts make it urgent to act quickly to resolve the legality of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The Justice Department move followed an appeals court order earlier Tuesday, which returned one lawsuit over the census to a district court judge to address recently-discovered evidence that the addition of a citizenship question may have been intended to diminish the political impact of the Latino vote.

Story Continued Below

The latest tumult in the litigation was prompted by citizenship question opponents gaining access to evidence that the views of a deceased GOP redistricting expert, Thomas Hofeller, may have played a role in a Justice Department request that led to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross adding the citizenship query to the census questionnaire.

In a two-page letter to the high court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco essentially invited the justices to shut down the pending lawsuits by declaring that Ross’ decision was lawful and that further inquiry into the motives for the decision is unnecessary.

“The Fourth Circuit’s order underscores the need for this court to address the equal-protection claim and the immateriality of the Hofeller files in its disposition of the above-captioned case so that the lawfulness of the secretary’s decision can be fully and finally resolved,” Francisco wrote. He said the government needs a quick and clear decision by the end of this month in order to finalize the print version of the census forms for use next year.

Before the Justice Department’s latest salvo, civil rights groups celebrated the order from the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit as an indication that their arguments against the citizenship question were gaining traction.

“The always-flimsy house of cards shielding the Trump administration’s biased and nefarious intent in adding a citizenship query to Census 2020 is rapidly collapsing,” said Thomas Saenz of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, one of the groups fighting the added question. “We look forward to presenting our enhanced case demonstrating the unlawful nature of the late addition of the citizenship question, and to vindicating one of our most enduring and important constitutional principles.”

The Trump administration has maintained that it added the question to enhance Voting Rights Act enforcement, but opponents say it was done for partisan reasons to discourage citizen and noncitizen immigrants from responding to the census.

Three federal judges have ruled that the addition of the question was illegal because it was justified inadequately by the officials involved.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on the issue this week. Decisions in some cases are expected Wednesday and additional releases are possible later in the week before the justices depart for their summer break."

"Treasury Department watchdog to investigate delays on Harriet Tubman $20 bill - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/treasury-department-watchdog-investigate-delays-harriet-tubman-20-bill-2019-jun,"The U.S. Treasury's watchdog says it will look into why the redesign of the $20 bill featuring abolitionist Harriet Tubman was delayed.

The Office of the Inspector General said in a letter on Friday to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that it will consider the matter as part of an audit that is about to begin. The Senate minority leader had asked the inspector general's office earlier this month to investigate the circumstances surrounding the decision to delay the redesign ""including any involvement by the White House.""

The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled to coincide with the 100th anniversary in 2020 of passage of the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month that it would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first for security reasons to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited. He said those bills will now be introduced before a redesigned $20 bill.

The decision to put Tubman on the $20 bill had been made by Mnuchin's predecessor, former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who had served in the Obama administration.

The Office of the Inspector General said it will be looking into whether security measures are properly being implemented into currency, among other measures. As part of that audit it will specifically include a review of the process with the $20 bill. The effort is expected to take 10 months, according to the letter.

Schumer said he is pleased the matter will be reviewed quickly.

""There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population ... the $20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that disparity, and rectify it,"" he said in a statement.

Schumer said the Trump administration's decision to delay the new note ""has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this.""

New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerNew EPA rule would expand Trump officials' powers to reject FOIA requests Overnight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John TrumpNew EPA rule would expand Trump officials' powers to reject FOIA requests Democratic senator introduces bill to ban gun silencers Democrats: Ex-Commerce aide said Ross asked him to examine adding census citizenship question MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

News outlets seized on the video as evidence of the Trump administration’s cruelty, but they omitted the crucial context.

In an attempt to justify Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s absurd comparison of American detention facilities to Holocaust-era concentration camps, many figures within the media have shared a viral video clip of a legal hearing in which a Department of Justice attorney debates a panel of judges as to what constitutes “sanitary conditions.” The majority of the shares were of a version put out by NowThis News, which claimed that the video shows a Trump administration official arguing that “children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.” The claim has led to several days of outrage, and has been used repeatedly as evidence that the current administration is being intentionally cruel to migrant children. Countless journalists, along with clickbait outlets such as The Hill and the Huffington Post , have highlighted the video inside this framing.

Unsurprisingly, it is not that simple. Indeed, the hearing in the video was related not to actions taken by the Trump administration, but to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that the CBP under the Obama administration had violated the Flores Settlement agreement with its treatment of children in custody. The judge in that case cited specific infractions that she felt were in violation of the “safe and sanitary” requirement under the Flores agreement and recommended a special monitor be appointed to ensure these facilities were complying with the original standard. The DOJ attorney in the video, Sarah Fabian, was not arguing that the United States should decline to provide those items to children, but rather that the Flores Settlement agreement didn’t specifically require those items. The notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit judges disagreed with this argument, preferring to read Flores narrowly. Fabian has been arguing similar cases on behalf of the Justice Department for years; that is her job. Some of her legal arguments have upset immigration advocates before. But they have never led to this type of media coverage, or to the claim that her fulfilling her legal role is indicative of a moral shortcoming.

Predictably, the vast majority of the people and the outlets that shared this exchange failed to note that the violations being discussed had occurred during the previous administration, while those who did know failed to ask themselves (and others) why the violations didn’t receive similar coverage when they were first exposed. Instead, they jumped straight to the conclusion that the federal government, headed up by President Trump, was deliberately inflicting pain on babies. This isn’t true.

It wasn’t true during the Obama administration either. Then, as now, the violations weren’t part of an intentional or evil ploy, but were the product of the system’s being overloaded. Then, as now, the intended care at these facilities was humane, and consistent within the requirement under Flores. In 2014, the Obama administration was dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strained the facilities. In 2019, the Trump administration is dealing with a serious crisis: a large influx of unaccompanied minors that strains the facilities. In consequence, across multiple years and multiple administrations, the DOJ has repeatedly argued in court that the Flores Settlement agreement should be read narrowly, or allow for exceptions in difficult times. Certainly, governments make mistakes. Certainly, some facilities have taken shortcuts, as the result of either bureaucratic incompetence or limited resources. But those infractions will be fixed by additional funding, additional facilities, better oversight, and quicker processing, not by pretending that the president is a tyrant. The situation at the border is a difficult one, but selective outrage based on misleading facts won’t do much to address it.

This incident has been reminiscent of the recent outrage over pictures of “kids in cages” at detention facilities that, after a period, were revealed to date from the Obama administration. And, like that one, it has done a great deal of damage to our institutions, not only because it seems to neutral observers that the media gauges newsworthiness based on who is in the White House, but because the selective coverage and focus on imagined motives rather than real structural problems permits members of Congress to deflect from their own inaction, and thereby to ensure that the issues will continue ad nauseam."

The U.S. Treasury's Office of the Inspector General will review the delay of a new $20 bill design featuring abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said in a letter released Monday.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled for 2020 and coincided with the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment which gave women the right to vote.

But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month that the redesign would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited. He said those bills will be introduced before a redesigned $20 bill.

A Treasury Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement that process of issuing a new bill is not political. The security of the currency and combating counterfeiting are the only concerns considered in the redesign schedule, the statement says.

The Office of the Inspector General said their audit will be looking into security measures at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The effort is expected to take 10 months, according to the letter.

On June 19, Schumer asked the office to investigate whether the delay was driven by political reasons.

Schumer said in a news release that he is pleased the Treasury Department is looking into the issue.

“There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population, and the previous administration’s plan to put New Yorker Harriet Tubman, on the $20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that disparity, and rectify it,” he said.

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."
Mark Meadows: DOJ exploring 'unbelievably unusual activity' in final months of Obama administration,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-doj-exploring-unbelievably-unusual-activity-in-final-months-of-obama-administration,"Rep. Mark Meadows said the Justice Department is examining irregularities in the intelligence community as part of its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Reacting to newly released documents on changes in U.S. procedures for sharing raw intelligence, Meadows said there was ""unbelievably unusual activity"" in the final months of the Obama administration.

""I can tell you that [U.S. Attorney] John Durham and Attorney General [William] Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" the North Carolina Republican said Monday evening on Fox News. ""They are including in part of their surveillance — really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""

On Sean Hannity's show, before Meadows was brought on to speak along with colleague Rep. Jim Jordan, attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the latest findings by his conservative watchdog group, the American Center for Law and Justice.

The records obtained by the ACLJ showed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Clapper pushing to increase access to raw signal intelligence before President Trump took office. The New York Times first reported the expanded access to intercepted communications in January 2017. Although Hannity and Sekulow played up the newly released records, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, as suspiciously timed and ""rushed,"" the Times noted the discussions for such changes to remove bureaucratic barriers stretched back years dating back to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Still, Jordan said he suspects there was evidence of nefarious intent, tying the changes to an interview Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did in January 2017 in which the New York Democrat warned then-incoming President Trump that intelligence officials ""have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.""

""So this is one of those six ways,"" Jordan said, adding that the other ""ways"" include British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier the CIA's use of informants to make contact with members of the Trump campaign.

Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016. The DOJ review of the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action.

Jordan noted how first Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to wrap up his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and that could influence Durham's efforts. ""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation. And they have told us this is broader than just the FBI — they're going to look at all of this,"" Jordan said.

""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""

The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a ""disturbing"" scheme to politicize intelligence.

A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is ""broad in scope and multifaceted"" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners."

VA health care workers say managers are trying to silence them on veteran care,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Health care professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday that they are being punished for reporting problems with VA care, to the detriment of veterans and despite proclamations by the Trump administration that whistleblowers are celebrated and not scorned.

A physician from the Phoenix area, a psychologist from Baltimore and a CT technologist from Iowa City, Iowa, said they believe managers retaliated against them and tried to stop them from disclosing more issues at VA medical centers.

Their claims, first made in interviews with USA TODAY last week, contradict assertions by agency leaders and President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order and a law creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within months of taking office. The office, he said, would ""make sure that they're protected.""

The VA inspector general has since launched an investigation of the office's handling of whistleblower cases. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year raised concerns about the office allowing employees accused of wrongdoing by whistleblowers to be involved in investigating the accusations.

The employees who testified Tuesday have a track record of raising concerns about VA health care – and all three have been stripped of patient care and oversight duties.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell reported inadequate training and triage in the emergency room of the Phoenix VA. Psychologist Minu Aghevli reported improper removal of veterans from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA. CT tech Jeff Dettbarn revealed administrators had mass-canceled diagnostic test orders at the Iowa City VA without determining if veterans still needed the tests.

Dettbarn has been assigned to paperwork duties since his revelations in 2017, Aghevli was transferred to a data entry post in April and Mitchell has been kept from patient safety issues and oversight for nearly five years.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out has sent a signal to other VA employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

Aghevli likewise said she feels her treatment is ""being used as a threat against other employees"" and has a ""chilling effect"" on their speaking up about problems.

“It has a terrible effect on veterans,” she said.

""For every person who wants to speak up, there are thousands that have tried, only to be removed, demoted, (and) silence(d),"" Dettbarn said.

They recommended that more resources and staff be provided to an outside federal agency that helps whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, and an independent board that vets employee disciplinary appeals. They called for an overhaul of the Trump-created office.

Jacqueline Garrick, founder of nonprofit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, testified that they are not alone – almost 200 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 complaining of retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency.

""VA employees are ignored, attacked,"" she said, adding that the VA whistleblower office has not been the solution. ""Instead, it causes more harm,"" Garrick said.

Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project, another nonprofit group that helps whistleblowers, said the office lacks comprehensive regulations and works on an ""ad hoc"" basis.

""This maximizes confusion and enables arbitrary action,"" Devine said.

VA spokesman Randall Noller told USA TODAY last week that an assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a 2020 appropriations bill that provides funding for USDA. However, the bill also requires that the Inspector General perform a more extensive data review before any funds are used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. It would also examine data USDA used to conclude the increased line speeds would not impact animal welfare. DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

Oregon plant that discharged tons of ammonia signs consent decree with U.S. Justice Department,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Maxine Bernstein', 'Mbernstein Oregonian.Com', 'The Oregonian Oregonlive']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2019/06/oregon-plant-that-discharged-tons-of-ammonia-signs-consent-decree-with-federal-justice-department.html,"A company that failed to report a large-scale ammonia discharge from its plant just outside St. Helens and annual ammonia emission estimates has entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay a $492,000 fine and buy $931,500 in fire emergency equipment for area responders to handle environmental emergencies.

Dyno Nobel’s civil settlement with federal officials comes a year after the company paid a $250,000 fine for releasing more than six tons of anhydrous ammonia vapor into the air from the plant over three days starting on July 30, 2015 in a separate criminal case.

“We have worked cooperatively with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over the past eight-plus years to address these matters. Independent of its work with EPA, Dyno Nobel has implemented extensive upgrades to the facility to better manage emissions and improve our reporting protocols,” Jeffrey Droubay, the company’s senior vice president of legal and business affairs, said in a statement. “The health and safety of our employees and communities in which we operate is our first priority.''

Federal regulators accused the plant of failing to report hazardous releases of ammonia in a timely way, failing to accurately report annual releases of ammonia and failing to comply with all requirements to reduce the risk of a chemical accident at its plant, according to court records.

Under the decree, the Delaware-based company must hire an independent auditor to conduct regular compliance reviews, submit a revised risk management plan and adopt environmental safety procedures including the purchase of the emergency gear for Columbia Fire & Rescue and the Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The company must buy 50 sets of personal protective equipment, commonly known as “turnout gear,” for Columbia Fire & Rescue, 74 sets of self-contained breathing apparatus for Columbia Fire and 52 sets of the breathing apparatus for Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The Environmental Protection Agency will review all steps the company must take under the decree. If the company violates any of the required changes, it could face further financial penalties ranging from $1,000 per violation per day to $7,500 per violation per day.

A federal judge will retain oversight over the consent decree until the settlement’s terms are completed. It will remain in effect for at least three years after the reforms are adopted.

Dyno Nobel is located on 90 acres of Deer Island near St. Helens, employs 80 people and operates around-the-clock every day of the year. The Oregon plant makes ammonia and nitric acid, which is used in fertilizer, under high pressure and temperature, and other chemical products for fertilizer, refrigerant, and other agricultural and industrial applications, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In a separate settlement reached last year with federal prosecutors, the company acknowledged that it didn’t immediately notify the National Response Center, which is required under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, known as CERCLA, of its excessive ammonia discharge in 2015.

Company officials knew the excessive ammonia emissions were occurring but made no effort to alert authorities until Aug. 7, 2015, more than a week after the first discharge, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Bounds and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Karla Gebel Perrin.

Anhydrous ammonia is a pungent gas with suffocating fumes. Exposure to high concentrations can lead to death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The emissions triggered numerous complaints from neighboring residents in Columbia County, who reported foul odors, eye irritation and difficulty breathing, prosecutors said.

“Dyno Nobel has taken actions to address air emission issues over the past few years including tens of millions of dollars in new technology, investments, and upgrades to improve the facility’s ability to control emissions,’’ Droubay said in the statement.

Trump should shut up about the Federal Reserve,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-should-shut-up-about-the-federal-reserve,"Tweeting on the Federal Reserve, President Trump showed he has some delusional ideas about the economy.

The president claimed on Monday:

....Think of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right. Thousands of points higher on the Dow, and GDP in the 4’s or even 5’s. Now they stick, like a stubborn child, when we need rates cuts, & easing, to make up for what other countries are doing against us. Blew it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2019

Trump doesn't realize that U.S. economic institutions serve the national interest. While imperfect, these institutions ensure relative fair dealing and foster significant investor confidence. Applied to America's massive and diverse marketplace, institutions make the U.S. a profitable place to invest and save. Maintaining that confidence is crucial in maintaining the world's largest and most dynamic economy and in retaining the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. Even then, Trump's argument here is its own worst enemy.

After all, the economy is the keystone by which Trump can hope to be elected. Delivering great rewards across the socioeconomic spectrum, Trump's economy gives him a moral narrative that he can sell across the political spectrum. Yet, a necessary trade war with China (and a less necessary trade war with the European Union) is restraining investor confidence by cultivating a sense of doubt. Trump's frantic approach to governing also plays into the doubt issue.

This matters.

If businesses and most investors hate one thing, it's the condition of sustaining economic doubt. And were Trump to get his way and turn the Federal Reserve into a ""MAGA"" populist arm of government, the impact would be immediate. Investors would no longer see economic policy as the product of effective balancing between the executive, the legislature, and institutions such as the Federal Reserve, but as the whimsical creation of Trump's desire in any one moment — a surefire recipe for economic hedging and decline and a recipe for an economy that does Trump very few electoral favors.

Sure, there are legitimate debates over what Federal Reserve policy is best. But we should trust in a more apolitical Federal Reserve to make interest rate decisions in place of partisan politicians. There is nothing conservative about Trump's tweets on this issue. Nor do they serve his own interests. Trump should refocus his ire. Still not convinced?

Then ask yourself whether you'd like a new principle to be set and interest rate policies to be set under a future President Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders."

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

There are two principal complaints, as related in the New York Times and The New Republic. The Trump administration is inconsistent on human rights, giving a pass to allies such as Saudi Arabia while coming down hard on adversaries such as Iran. And the commission will try to push a narrow theocratic conception of human rights, one that scants gay rights and the right to abortion.

The first complaint is correct, but not distinctive to President Trump. No administration is or can be entirely consistent on human rights. . . . The U.S. has a lot of interests and they cannot always be simultaneously pursued. The Barack Obama administration was softer than Trump on Iran and harder on Saudi Arabia, in keeping with its own larger foreign-policy aims.

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."
"Homeland Security, other federal agencies remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, Senate panel finds",https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190625/homeland-security-other-federal-agencies-remain-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-senate-panel-finds,"The Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has found.

WASHINGTON — Federal government offices are wildly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.

But those being attacked are doing very little to protect themselves, according to the results of a 10-month Senate investigation of eight federal agencies.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, found that the Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, leaving them susceptible to cyberattack and Americans’ personal information vulnerable to theft.

The problems range from systems so antiquated that they can’t be updated with new security patches to agencies that year after year fail to protect the personal information of millions of Americans.

The subcommittee studied 10 years’ worth of government audits of the IT systems of the Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education departments and the Social Security Administration.

Their investigation comes after a surge in data breaches in the federal government, with agencies including the Postal Service, the IRS and the White House reporting attacks.

In 2015, for example, a hacker broke into government databases to gain access to 22 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.

In 2017 alone, federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents.

Federal agencies often have access to sensitive information because of the very nature of what they do.

The Department of Education collects financial data on students and parents applying for college loans.

Disabled Americans must provide years of health records to prove they are entitled to disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

And homeowners must provide payroll and savings information to HUD to qualify for home loans.

Congress tasked agencies with securing their information technology networks as far back as 2002, and asked each agency’s inspector general to annually audit compliance with basic cybersecurity standards.

But the subcommittee found that most of the agencies studied were failing to comply with even the most basic standards, including properly protecting personally identifiable information.

Five agencies did not maintain a comprehensive and accurate list of IT assets, meaning they had no idea which applications were operating on their networks.

All eight agencies failed to install security patches and other updates to prevent their systems from being vulnerable to attack.

In the most recent audits, seven of the eight agencies failed to provide for the adequate protection of personally identifiable information.

And all of the agencies used legacy systems that were so old that vendors no longer support or issue updates to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Homeland Security, for example, uses Windows 2003 on some of its systems.

The setup used by HUD to initiate and track loan-case numbers and associated data is so old that lenders are unable to submit loan applications electronically and must instead send hard copies through the mail.

In some cases, Social Security’s system to hold retirement and disability information on millions of Americans uses a programming language developed in the 1950s and 1960s — a language that will become increasingly obsolete as the IT professionals who know the language retire.

Some of the agencies are particularly susceptible to attack. The Department of Education, for example, has been unable to prevent unauthorized outside devices from easily connecting to the agency’s network since 2011.

In its 2018 audit, that department’s inspector general found that it had been able to restrict unauthorized access to 90 seconds — still enough time for a hacker to “launch an attack or gain intermittent access to internal network resources that could lead to” exposing the agency’s data.

Portman said federal agencies “have failed at implementing basic cybersecurity practices, leaving classified, personal and sensitive information unsafe and vulnerable to theft.”

“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” he said.

The report makes a list of recommendations aimed at securing government IT systems. Among them are ones urging federal agencies to consolidate security processes and capabilities in order to better detect cybersecurity incidents and another calling on each agency to give broader authority and latitude to their chief information officer to make organization-wide decisions regarding cybersecurity.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, the ranking member of the subcommittee, said the Office of Management and Budget — the agency responsible for cybersecurity efforts across government — “must provide the necessary leadership to ensure that agencies are staying vigilant and prioritizing good cybersecurity practices.”

“We know that the threats posed by cyberattacks continue to evolve and grow every day, so it is crucial that agencies across our government prioritize efforts to better protect their networks from hackers,” he said.

While At Bloomberg', 'She Won The Gerald Loeb Award For Distinguished Business', 'Financial Journalism', 'The Highest Honor In Business Reporting', ""For Her Coverage Of The Financial Crisis.

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"

According to the 2018 National Air Toxics Report, this little area by the Mississippi River still has the highest risk of cancer from air pollution in the nation. This time, between ethylene oxide, which emanates from a local Union Carbide plant, chloroprene and 43 other industrial chemicals, the risk is up to 1,505 cancers per million people — almost 50 times the national average. Some residents I wrote about in my first story have died .

For the rest of the people in St. John and the other places facing high cancer risks, there is still hope. The E.P.A. has already done most of the hard work, studying and measuring the chemicals that threaten the lives of people around the country. Now it just has to get over its anti-regulatory bias, act on its own science and get rid of them.

Ex-top CIA official perturbed by John Durham's review of intelligence analysts,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Manuel Balce Ceneta'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-cia-official-perturbed-by-john-durhams-review-of-intelligence-analysts,"A former top CIA official warned of dire consequences from the Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Michael Morell (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

As part of the ""investigation into the investigators,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham's team reportedly wants to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

The review is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action. Top CIA officials are said to be anxious over the federal prosecutor's efforts.

Michael Morell, who was deputy director of the CIA during the Obama administration, said Durham's interest in speaking to a CIA analyst concerns him.

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" Morell told CBS News, where he is now a senior national security contributor.

""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis,"" Morrell added.

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

American officials say Attorney General William Barr, who is overseeing Durham's efforts and earlier this year riled Democrats when he said ""spying did occur"" against the Trump 2016 campaign, wants to understand how the CIA coordinated with the FBI and how the agency came to its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order to sow discord in the election to help Trump and undermine his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

That effort culminated in the January 2017 release of a intelligence community assessment, commissioned by former President Barack Obama. In that report, the CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" that Russia sought to boost Trump while the National Security Agency had ""moderate confidence.""

The Senate and House intelligence committees both reviewed the assessment, revealing a partisan divide. While the Senate panel, known for being largely bipartisan, called it a ""sound intelligence product,"" the House Intelligence Committee was more critical. In 2018, the then-GOP led House panel said most of the assessment's analysis ""held up to scrutiny,"" but noted the judgment about Putin ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for [intelligence community] analysis."" Democrats on the committee disagreed with that assessment.

Democrats argue Barr's effort is part of a plan to stonewall the public from learning about President Trump potentially committing obstruction of justice. Upon the conclusion of his Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller laid out 10 instances of possible obstruction but declined to make a determination about whether he should be accused of a crime.

""Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a tweet after the president gave Barr sweeping powers to declassify documents in the investigation.

Siding with Democrats, Morrell said he feels ""strongly"" the Justice Department has ""NO business"" doing a follow-up review of the intelligence community analysis. ""It does not have the knowledge & expertise necessary to get the right answers and it could well have a chilling effect across the analytic community,"" he said in a tweet."
