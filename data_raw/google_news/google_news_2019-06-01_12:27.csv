Trump Administration Strips India of Special Trade Status,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Vindu Goel']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/trump-india-trade.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Friday that it was stripping India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars of its products from American tariffs, part of a deepening clash over India’s protections for its market.

The White House said that it would terminate India’s preferential market access to the United States as of June 5. The notice claimed that India had not given the United States “equitable and reasonable access to its markets.”

The administration said that it would also apply to India tariffs on solar panels and washers that President Trump announced last year, suspending an exemption it had granted to certain developing countries.

The measure will hit some Indian exporters of products like textiles, jewelry, auto parts and agricultural products, and aggravate tensions between the United States and a country the Trump administration has described as an ally to counter China."
Nunes demands public release of Mueller's 'backup and source documentation',https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Katie Galioto']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/nunes-mueller-backup-source-documentation-1349437,"Rep. Devin Nunes argued that accessing Robert Mueller's ""backup and source documentation"" would expose Mueller's effort as a ""fraud."" | Drew Angerer/Getty Images congress Nunes demands public release of Mueller's 'backup and source documentation'

Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, called Friday for the public release of all of special counsel Robert Mueller's ""backup and source documentation,"" a call that goes even further than most Democrats' demands for more transparency around Mueller's report.

Though most Republicans in Congress have lambasted Democrats for continuing to demand access to Mueller's underlying files, Nunes (R-Calif.) argued that accessing those documents — and making them public — would expose Mueller's effort as a ""fraud."" Democrats say they want the same materials because they'll aid investigations into Mueller's evidence that President Donald Trump repeatedly attempted to obstruct his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Story Continued Below

Nunes' argument followed the release by prosecutors of a voicemail left by one of Trump's attorneys in 2017 with a lawyer for Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who became a crucial cooperator for Mueller. The voicemail from Dowd came on the eve of Flynn's decision to abandon a joint defense agreement with Trump and begin working with Mueller. In his report's volume on obstruction of justice, Mueller highlighted excerpts of the voicemail noting that Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, asked for a heads up on any information that ""implicates the president"" and mentioned Trump's ""feelings toward Flynn.""

On Friday, Mueller's team released a full transcript of the voicemail on the order of a federal judge. In the fuller transcript, Dowd had indicated he wanted a heads up ""not only for the president but for the country.""

""Um, just for the sake of...protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information,"" Dowd said, according to the transcript.

Nunes pointed to the omission of those lines from Mueller's report as proof of malfeasance on Mueller's part and said it justifies the public release of all of Mueller's backup information.

""This is why we need all backup and source documentation for the #muellerdossier released publicly. It’s all a fraud..."" Nunes tweeted.

Mueller highlighted Dowd's voicemail as part of his evidence suggesting Trump or his allies may have attempted to influence Flynn's willingness to cooperate with investigators. Mueller's argument that Dowd had conveyed Trump's continued warm feelings toward Flynn — combined with public and private efforts by Trump to encourage Flynn to stay strong — could have affected Flynn's willingness to cooperate, or limited the extent of his willingness to help. But Mueller also noted that attorney-client privilege issues prevented him from learning whether Trump ""was personally involved in or knew about"" Dowd's outreach.

Notably, Democrats have met fierce criticism from Republicans for making similar demands. They've accused Democrats of trying to relitigate Mueller's findings and Trump has attacked them repeatedly as seeking a ""do-over"" of Mueller's work. He asserted executive privilege earlier this month at the urging of Attorney General William Barr to shield Mueller's underlying evidence from efforts by Congress to obtain them.

It's not the first time Nunes has broken from the GOP message on the Mueller report. He signed two joint letters with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) demanding access to all of Mueller's files for the committee, even threatening to subpoena for them if Barr didn't cooperate. Schiff issued that subpoena earlier this month."

For several years he was also my colleague, and in some ways my protégé, at the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.

Then Ahmari saw the light.

To be the polite conservative — the kind who presents well at, say, the Aspen Ideas Festival — was, Ahmari decided, to be a sucker. It was to play by the house rules of the culturally dominant left, in which the house always has the advantage and usually wins the game. It was to bid for the good opinion of people who will never think of conservatism as anything other than the malignant spawn of avarice and stupidity.

From then on it would be no more Mr. Nice Conservative for Ahmari, an immigrant from Iran who is now the opinion editor of The New York Post and an ardent convert to Catholicism. His enemies weren’t just on the left, but also on the insufficiently right. And by insufficient, Ahmari wasn’t thinking only of ideology. He also meant those deficient in the kind of personal nastiness that is supposed to be a virtue in the right’s death struggle against progressive orthodoxies.

All this is now spelled out by Ahmari in a much-discussed (at least on the right) new essay titled “Against David Frenchism,” published in the Catholic magazine “First Things.” For those unfamiliar with the name, David French is a longtime contributor to National Review, a legal advocate for religious liberty and free speech, an evangelical Christian, and a recipient of the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq."

President Trump, confronted with the latest surge of migration that threatens his tough-on-the-border image, was ready to launch his newest plan — across-the-board tariffs on Mexican goods, likely to wound the healthy economy and trigger protests from parts of his own party.

But during a Wednesday night huddle inside the Oval Office, Trump was running into a roadblock: his own advisers.

Calling in from his travels in the Middle East, presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner argued against imposing unilateral tariffs, warning that the move could imperil the prospects of ratifying a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, according to officials familiar with the meeting. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, insisted that he could still work directly with Mexico to resolve the burgeoning migration crisis.

In the Oval Office with Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer also lobbied against the tariffs, similarly concerned that the drastic threat against the United States’ third-largest trading partner would upend the fragile trade agreement, which still requires Congress’s blessing.

But Trump was unmoved by the arguments and repeatedly said Mexico had to do more, one person with knowledge of the meeting said. The tariffs, he declared, were going to be announced no matter what.

Roughly 24 hours later, Trump would go public with his latest attempt to stop the migration of Central Americans arriving in record numbers at the southern border, seeking to punish Mexico by gradually increasing tariffs on the entire universe of its goods.

This account of Trump’s decision to open a new front in his battles over immigration and trade — and the ensuing fallout — is based on interviews with 14 White House officials, lawmakers, congressional aides and others familiar with the issue, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The tactic sowed disruption on multiple fronts Friday as top Mexican officials rushed to Washington to defuse the threat, the stock market tumbled on the news and administration officials offered little explanation of how increasing the prices of goods from Mexico would stop illegal immigration at the border, a goal that has eluded multiple administrations.

“He’s trying to solve a humanitarian situation by creating economic chaos,” said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), whose state would be devastated in any trade standoff with Mexico. “He doesn’t have a coherent strategy for how to deal with any of this stuff.”

Still, the chorus of objections that enveloped the White House did little to discourage Trump, who was infuriated after more than 1,000 migrants from Central America surrendered early Wednesday to U.S. officials near El Paso. That development — on the same day that former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III delivered an in-person statement on the conclusions of his Russia investigation — marked the largest group of migrants taken into custody by U.S. border authorities in a single event.

On Friday, Trump defended his threat, insisting that Mexico “has taken advantage of the United States for decades.”

“Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem,” Trump tweeted as the pushback from Republican lawmakers and the business lobby continued to pour in. “Time for them to finally do what must be done!”

Under the White House threat, the United States would implement a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if illegal migration hadn’t stopped by then. That figure would rise to a 10 percent tariff on July 1 and then an additional 5 percent on the first day of each month for three months, maxing out at 25 percent on Mexican products until the country “substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.”

In public, Trump administration officials sought to defend the plan by pointing to the rising number of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border — a trend that shows no signs of reversing. The Department of Homeland Security projects that the month of May is on track to record the highest number of border apprehensions in more than a dozen years.

“Let me [be] clear, the current situation is risking the lives of children every day,” acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan said, calling for Mexico to take “significant action” to secure its own southern border.

But privately, top officials were caught in an administration-wide scramble as aides continued to have meetings with Trump on Friday to try to persuade him to reverse course, two officials said.

The idea of enacting unilateral tariffs against Mexico had surfaced repeatedly in internal discussions — and seriously enough that the White House Counsel’s Office had already written a draft of the plan when Trump brought up the proposal again Wednesday, officials said. White House lawyers had been studying their legal options since Trump threatened to shut down the entire U.S.-Mexico border before backing down.

The arguments against the tariffs — voiced internally by Kushner, Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — did little to dissuade Trump, and Kushner was asked to call Mexican officials to inform them of the impending threat.

After the Wednesday night meeting in the Oval Office, the tariff order was finalized by the White House counsel and the office of Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser and immigration hard-liner who oversees domestic policy.

But Thursday morning, it was unclear whether Trump would actually follow through, even as he hinted at a “big league” announcement on immigration before leaving Washington for an Air Force Academy address in Colorado. Other White House offices not included in the initial tariff discussions — such as the legislative affairs division and the office of the public liaison — learned as aides came into work Thursday that Trump was considering such an announcement.

By the time a cadre of senior White House aides assembled for a 4:30 p.m. meeting Thursday, the decision to announce the tariffs was essentially finalized, even though it had appeared to be in flux for much of the day. Trump called in from Air Force One as he returned from Colorado and told the staff that he wanted the announcement put out immediately.

Vice President Pence — traveling in Ottawa to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and promote the pending trade agreement — separately phoned congressional Republican leaders to inform them of the imminent announcement. The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady (Tex.), was told in advance, but Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), who leads a powerful panel overseeing trade policy, was not, according to their aides.

“The president didn’t blindside his own party,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday. “If Republicans weren’t aware, then they haven’t been paying attention.”

From the driveway of the White House, Sanders continued, “Anybody in this country — or frankly, in the world — that says they’re surprised by this has been living under a rock and not paying attention.”

Nonetheless, Trump told people around him that he was well aware that many Republican senators would not like the tariff threat. Indeed, White House legislative staffers were flooded with calls Thursday night, although they referred all the inquiries to the counsel’s office, according to two senior White House aides.

The objections were particularly pointed Friday from proponents of free trade such as Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), but they also flooded in from border-state Republicans who have been reliable Trump allies but also are on the ballot in 2020.

“While I support the president’s intention of stopping unchecked illegal immigration, I do not support these types of tariffs, which will harm our economy and be passed onto Arizona small businesses and families,” Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) said in a statement.

A spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) conveyed similar sentiments: “Senator Cornyn supports the President’s commitment to securing our border, but he opposes this across-the-board tariff which will disproportionately hurt Texas.”

House Democrats began considering legislative remedies aimed at halting imposition of the tariffs, although one leadership aide said they needed more information from the administration to determine their options.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, and economic staffers fielded a range of calls Friday from business leaders. In response, the White House told corporate officials to put pressure on Mexico, according to a senior administration official.

Meanwhile, the Mexican government scrambled to stave off the looming taxes, announcing that its delegation and U.S. officials will meet in Washington on Wednesday, with the sides led by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“Trump loves tariffs. That’s fine, but this needs to end in policy wins,” said Republican donor Dan Eberhart. “The short-term pain needs to produce a long-term gain for America.”"
"Arthur Herman: Mueller vs. Trump -- America’s the real loser and Russia, Iran, China look like big winners",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Arthur Herman', 'Historian Arthur Herman Is A Senior Fellow At The']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/arthur-herman-mueller-trump-russia-china-iran-winners-impeachment,"For the past two years, special prosecutor Robert Mueller has been sitting on a political powder keg; in an eight-and-a-half minute statement on Wednesday, he decided to light the fuse. By giving Congress the green light to impeach Donald Trump, he has detonated a political explosion that will continue to rock Washington and the nation for the next decade, and far beyond the 2020 election.

And watching it all, and celebrating it all, will be the men who govern the worst and most oppressive regimes in the world.

Today America confronts a trio of revision powers – Russia, Iran, and above all China – determined to shove America into the shadows. They have joined forces to support the world’s most oppressive and dangerous dictators from North Korea and Syria to Venezuela. Only America has the resources to stop them.

The danger we now face is that an America trapped in a perpetual political crisis, and a chief executive hobbled by a bitter impeachment battle, won’t have the will or strength to prevent this new Axis, like its pre-World War Two predecessor, from creating an authoritarian world order.

MEDIA FLOODED WITH IMPEACHMENT STORIES, DESPITE TEPID BACKING ON CAPITOL HILL

The danger we now face is that an America trapped in a perpetual political crisis, and a chief executive hobbled by a bitter impeachment battle, won’t have the will or strength to prevent this new Axis, like its pre-World War Two predecessor, from creating an authoritarian world order.

The shame is that Mueller could have used his statement on Wednesday to defuse that political crisis. He could have simply said, “Everything we have to say is contained in our report. We had to conclude there’s no evidence of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election; my team, which included top Hillary supporters and leading Trump haters, could find no probable cause to make the case President Trump obstructed justice, either. For our nation’s future, it’s time for all of us to move on, as I have.”

Unfortunately, that sort of nobility of spirit was beyond Bob Mueller. Instead, he took one last swipe at the president he despises, as he urged Congress to continue to look for crimes the facts say didn’t happen – and the law says can’t be proved.

Thanks to Mueller, impeachment by a Democrat-led Congress is almost certain; the defeat of impeachment in the Republican-dominated Senate is just as certain. This process will satisfy no one; it will leave us more divided than ever, with an ever-diminishing faith in our governing institutions to secure justice or to handle a national crisis.

On the world stage, however, this leaves America in a far worse state.

China, in particular, will see America’s weakness as their opportunity to checkmate Trump’s trade and foreign policy initiatives, which are aimed at stopping China’s drive to displace the United States as the world’s superpower. The men in Beijing understand that Trump is the first president in a generation to “get it” about China’s effort to create a new world order that depends on the Chinese economy, Chinese technologies, and China’s grand strategic vision outlined the Communist Party document “Made in China 2025” – in other words, a president who has to be stopped in his tracks.

A weakened Donald Trump will play directly into Beijing’s plans. Even more insidiously, perpetual turmoil in Washington reinforces China’s propagandistic campaign to the world that it, not America, has found the secret to democracy in the 21st century. Beijing routinely touts the so-called China model, i.e. a top-down system where the communist party recruits and rewards an elite drawn from all classes of society while excluding and punishing those who resist the party line, the true “democracy” of the future. Chinese party leaders extol their version of democracy as embodying stability and predictability, compared to the uncertainty and chaos of American democracy – a contrast which we’re managing to confirm.

Now, some believe getting Donald Trump out of office is going to somehow restore faith in our political system, and clean the slate. Others –largely Trump supporters – think exposing the effort by high-level government officials, including in the FBI, to derail Trump’s candidacy and then his presidency, will do the same thing, and allow the president to finally govern in peace.

Both sides think if they win this nightmare will be over. Both are wrong.

Democrats and NeverTrumpers will never stop believing Trump’s election was a swindle and the triumph of bigotry and hate. Trump supporters will continue to believe that impeachment is a swindle, and the triumph of the other side’s lies and corruption.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Federal prosecutors on Friday declined to make public transcripts of recorded conversations between Michael Flynn and Russia’s ambassador to the United States in December 2016, despite a judge’s order.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department wrote that it did not rely on such recordings to establish Flynn’s guilt or determine a recommendation for his sentencing.

Prosecutors also failed to release an unredacted version of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn that the judge had ordered be made public.

Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and he cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. He is awaiting sentencing.

The government’s unusual response came after U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington ordered earlier in May that the Justice Department make public various materials related to the case, including transcripts of any audio recordings of Flynn, such as his conversations with Russian officials.

[Judge orders public release of what Michael Flynn said in call to Russian ambassador]

Prosecutors provided one item that Sullivan ordered be released: a transcript of a voice mail left by an attorney for Trump, much of which had already appeared in Mueller’s report. It is unclear how the judge will react to the government’s noncompliance with other elements of his order. Late last year, Sullivan postponed Flynn’s sentencing after angrily lambasting the former national security adviser for his actions, saying, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

While Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak were described in Mueller’s report and in court documents, the exact words the two men used have not been revealed. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the existence of recordings, which are classified.

Sullivan made clear he wanted the full transcript of Flynn’s calls to be shared with the public, although he did not provide his reasoning. The Justice Department’s response appeared to duck that order.

Prosecutors Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Department’s national security division, who was formerly on Mueller’s team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Curtis of Washington provided little explanation as to why they were not turning over the transcripts but indicated that the judge had asked for material that was not relevant to Flynn’s eventual sentencing.

In a single line addressing Sullivan’s order, prosecutors wrote that the government “is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record.”

Sullivan’s request was atypical, some legal experts said, in that he demanded the release of classified records that prosecutors did not use to prove Flynn’s guilt.

Still, some former prosecutors said the government’s response was also notably spare.

“I’m sure they spent a ton of time thinking about how to do this — to protect intelligence equities, to protect their case, to try not to annoy the judge, to balance all those interests,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Michigan.

She noted that although there was no public indication that prosecutors had filed additional material under seal, it was possible that they did.

“If they’re simply trying to avoid the order by sidestepping it and saying ‘it’s not necessary to your sentencing decision,’ judges tend not to be satisfied with such a response,” she added.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington declined to comment.

The transcripts of the Flynn-Kisylak calls would provide a rare glimpse into the power of American surveillance to capture the private discussions of foreign emissaries — and an intimate look at a budding relationship between a top Russian official and one of the president-elect’s most trusted lieutenants in the weeks before Trump took office.

Flynn’s lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador made him the shortest-serving national security adviser in U.S. history: He spent just 24 days in the prestigious White House job.

Sullivan ordered the transcripts of Flynn’s conversations released two weeks ago after The Washington Post filed a motion seeking the release of redacted and sealed documents in the case. The Post argued that the public deserved to know more about the Trump adviser’s role in key events and the information he shared with investigators.

As part of his order, Sullivan had also given the government until Friday to release an unredacted version of portions of Mueller’s report dealing with Flynn.

In declining to release that, prosecutors wrote that the “limited remaining redactions pertain to sourcing of information, such as references to grand jury subpoenas.”

They provided no explanation other than to say that “all of the information in the Report that the defendant provided to the Special Counsel’s Office has been unredacted, as has all of the information in the Report that others provided about the defendant.”

The one item that the Justice Department made public on Sullivan’s order was a full transcript of a voice mail that John Dowd, a private attorney for Trump, left for Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner in November 2017.

Most of the voice mail was quoted in Mueller’s report, which described a message left by a personal counsel to Trump for a Flynn attorney after the former national security adviser began to cooperate with investigators. The special counsel scrutinized the message as part of his investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

The Trump counsel was Dowd, according to people familiar with the episode.

In the voice mail to Kelner, Dowd described himself as “sympathetic.”

“I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms,” he said, adding that if “there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue.”

“So you know, ...we need some kind of heads up,” he added. “Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information....remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”

In a statement Friday, Dowd said there was never anything improper about his contact with Flynn’s lawyer and that he had never tried to discourage Flynn’s cooperation with the government.

“This is clearly a baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people,” Dowd said of the special counsel report.

US Border Patrol agents will deploy to Guatemala to train 'side-by-side',https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/us-border-patrol-agents-will-train-guatemala/index.html,"(CNN) US Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers will be sent to Guatemala to assist in training missions with local authorities as part of a two-year plan aimed at decreasing migration flows to the United States.

Agents will be ""side-by-side"" with local Guatemalan authorities, deployed to locations where US law enforcement has not traditionally operated, according to a senior DHS official.

This is a unique surge of DHS personnel to Guatemala, with a ""significant increase"" in US law enforcement presence in the country, said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The deployment of DHS officers follows an agreement signed earlier this week between the US and Guatemalan governments. It comes as the administration is trying to find a way to stem the influx of migrant families, mostly from Central America, through Mexico to the US.

The number of migrants illegally crossing the the southern US border has been on a steady upswing, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in US holding facilities at the border. The month of May is on pace to have the highest number of border crossings in over 12 years, according to McAleenan.

State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

Interested in LGBT? Add LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
William Barr just contradicted himself over a key claim he's made about Mueller's obstruction findings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-contradicted-himself-key-claim-made-mueller-obstruction-findings-2019-5,"Attorney General William Barr contradicted himself in a significant way during an exclusive interview with CBS News, during which he revealed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""didn't agree with the legal analysis"" the former special counsel Robert Mueller used in his obstruction-of-justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

The attorney general added during the CBS interview that Mueller's analysis ""did not reflect the views of the department"" and instead represented ""the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers.""

But on May 1, while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr said the department ""accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusion"" in the obstruction case.

During his CBS News interview, Barr told host Jan Crawford that DOJ officials ""applied what we thought was the right law [in the obstruction case], but then we didn't rely on that. We also looked at all the facts, tried to determine whether the government could establish all the elements, and as to each of those episodes, we felt that the evidence was deficient.""

Mueller did not make a ""traditional prosecutorial judgment"" on whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. But prosecutors laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence — including 11 potential instances of obstruction — against Trump, many of which appear to meet the legal criteria needed to prove obstruction of justice.

Mueller cited a 1973 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo — which says a sitting president cannot be indicted — as the primary reason he didn't make a conclusion one way or another on whether Trump obstructed justice. Many legal experts have said that even if Mueller couldn't indict Trump, he still could have stated that he believed there was enough evidence of criminal activity.

But Mueller said that suggesting Trump should be charged without actually charging him would be unfair because it would deprive the president of the chance to clear his name in a court of law. For that reason, Mueller said he didn't believe he was authorized to make a formal conclusion on the obstruction question.

Prosecutors noted, however, that their report ""does not exonerate"" the president and that if they had confidence Trump did not [emphasis ours] commit a crime, they would have said so.

They also pointed out that a president is not immune from criminal prosecution once he leaves office, and that the Constitution ""requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" which is a reference to impeachment.

One former senior DOJ official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director characterized Mueller's report and his public statement this week to INSIDER as ""Mueller, in his own way and as loudly as he legally could, shouting from the rooftops that Congress needs to act.""

""Mueller isn't [Whitewater independent counsel] Ken Starr,"" the former senior official added. ""He's not a showman, he's a prosecutor. He got the evidence, he laid out all the facts, and he did the heavy lifting. Now, he's basically saying to Congress: the ball's in your court. Start the impeachment process.""

Before Mueller's report was released to the public, the attorney general took the unusual step of releasing a four-page summary of his ""principal conclusions"" of Mueller's findings. Barr said Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence to charge Trump or anyone on his campaign for conspiring with the Russian government during the 2016 election.

Read more: Elizabeth Warren says she'd reverse the DOJ policy that says a sitting president can't be indicted

In the obstruction case, Barr took it upon himself to conclude that there wasn't enough evidence to accuse Trump of obstructing justice.

Barr told CBS News that Mueller's statement that he could not clear Trump of a crime ""is not the standard we use at the department.""

""We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law, and so we applied the standards we would normally apply,"" Barr said. ""We analyzed the law and the facts, and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that, both, as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction.""

Barr's interview comes as he weathers a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Mueller's report. Barr told Congress during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that he would do everything he could to protect the integrity of the FBI's Russia probe and that he did not believe Mueller was on a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump and his allies often claim.

But since taking over as attorney general, Barr has gone to significant lengths to defend the president in ways that many say casts him more as the president's personal defense attorney instead of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.

Barr also skipped a scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee about his oversight of the Russia probe; he launched multiple investigations into the origins of the Russia probe; and he accused the FBI of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign.

This week, during his interview with CBS News, Barr used more inflammatory rhetoric to describe the Russia investigation, saying the bureau crossed "" a serious red line"" by investigating Trump. Seconds later, however, the attorney general admitted he had no clear basis for making the allegation."

One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"

The U.S. Justice Department is planning an antitrust investigation into Alphabet's Google subsidiary, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The effort will touch on web search and other parts of Google, the report said.

The report comes amid discussion from politicians and the public about whether large technology companies should be broken up. Government pushback on Alphabet in search could hit at the core one of the most highly valued publicly traded companies in the world.

Alphabet racked up $136.8 billion in revenue in 2018, with 85% of it coming from advertising. Google controls more than 70% of the search engine market, according to NetMarketShare.

Google has faced antitrust pressure in the past.

In 2013, Google said it would change some practices after it agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FTC had been concerned that some of Google's business practices could stifle competition

In 2010, the company received an antitrust complaint from the European Commission regarding ranking of shopping search results and ads, which resulted in Google being fined $2.7 billion in 2017, according to Alphabet's latest annual report. In 2016, the EC complained about practices related to Google's Android operating system, leading to a $5.1 billion charge in 2018.

And in March the European Union ordered Google to pay around $1.7 billion because of advertising behavior.

Recently, Google has also come under political pressure in the U.S.

President Trump has been critical of big tech, including accusing Google of political bias in its search results. In March, Trump tweeted accusations that Google's YouTube and Twitter favored Democratic opponents over him and Republicans.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who announced her 2020 presidential candidacy in December, has pressed for breaking up tech companies like Google. In a widely read post published on Medium in March, Warren said she was interested in appointing regulators who would be interested in undoing what she called ""anti-competitive mergers,"" including Google's DoubleClick, Nest and Waze.

""Current antitrust laws empower federal regulators to break up mergers that reduce competition,"" Warren wrote.

Google wouldn't be the first U.S. technology company to face scrutiny from the Justice Department. That agency launched a major antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998 that led to several rules the company had to follow for years.

The Justice Department had no comment. Google didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Transcript released of Flynn voicemail from Trump lawyer showing possible attempt to obstruct,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/michael-flynn-john-dowd-voicemail/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department on Friday released a more complete transcript of a voice mail from Donald Trump's attorney John Dowd to Rob Kelner, the lawyer for Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, where he sought information about Flynn's discussions with the special counsel on the eve of his cooperation deal.

However, the Justice Department refused to turn over transcripts of Flynn's calls with Russian officials, including then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, even though a federal judge had ordered prosecutors to file those publicly as well on Friday.

The release of the transcript -- and lack of the other release of transcripts -- came following Judge Emmet Sullivan's unusual order last week seeking public disclosure of documents used in Flynn's case as he heads toward sentencing Flynn for lying to investigators.

Overall, the voice mail highlights a call that special counsel Robert Mueller investigated as potential obstruction of justice by the President. Dowd had made the call on November 22, 2017, after Flynn's team said it could no longer communicate with the White House, just before Flynn pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate in Mueller's investigation.

In the voice mail transcript, most of which was previously documented in the Mueller report, Dowd said it ""wouldn't surprise me"" if Flynn was about to make a deal, but if it ""implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, or ... some issue ... not only for the President, but for the country."" He then asked for a ""heads up,"" according to the transcript. Dowd also wanted to remind Flynn about ""the President and his feelings towards Flynn.""

Dozens of Homeland Security agents and investigators will deploy to Guatemala as part of the Trump administration’s desperate attempt to slow unauthorized migration to the United States from Central America, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.

The Department of Homeland Security personnel will work as “advisers” to Guatemala’s national police and migration authorities, and they will aim to disrupt and interdict human smuggling operations, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a plan that has not been made public. U.S. authorities hope that the effort will cut off popular routes to the United States and deter migrants from beginning their journeys north through Mexico.

Plans call for at least several dozen DHS agents and investigators, and one DHS official briefed on the plans said about 80 U.S. law enforcement personnel will deploy as part of the mission. Another DHS official said Immigration and Customs Enforcement will send 18 Homeland Security Investigations agents and intelligence analysts, along with six agents from the Enforcement and Removal Operations division.

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan has advocated the more muscular DHS presence and finalized the agreement with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and other top Guatemalan officials during meetings this week in Guatemala City.

“The U.S. and Guatemala are formalizing a number of initiatives to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S., perpetuating the ongoing crisis at our border,” McAleenan said in a statement, after signing a “Memorandum of Cooperation” with Guatemalan officials.

President Trump, who threatened Thursday to impose severe tariffs on Mexican imports if the country’s government doesn’t crack down on migration, has said he will cut off aid to Central America in an effort to pressure the region’s leaders.

But McAleenan has urged more — not less — cooperation with Central America, and his plan to assign personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations to work alongside Guatemalan police amounts to an attempt to put more weight behind the approach.

According to DHS, the agreement allows for “concrete actions” including “law enforcement training and collaboration to improve criminal investigations.”

The U.S. agents probably would deploy to Guatemala and its border with Mexico for weeks at a time in an “advisory” role. U.S. security personnel assigned to Guatemala are typically authorized to carry weapons.

“Other areas of cooperation include increasing the security of the Guatemalan border to stem the flow of irregular migration while ensuring proper preparation to improve the ability of both countries to identify and better understand their root causes,” according to a DHS news release.

While the scale of the deployment and the location — the Guatemala-Mexico border — would be unusual, there are precedents for U.S. law enforcement presence in Central America. Armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents conduct operations in the region, and CBP advisers work with Mexican officials to improve immigration screening procedures and to upgrade technology.

One of the areas U.S. agents will target is the department of Huehuetenango in Guatemala’s destitute western highlands, where emigration levels are among the highest in the region.

Villages along the Pan-American Highway through Huehue­tenango have been emptying out, and in some places, residents say half the population has left for the United States in the past two years. Coffee fields have been abandoned. Many families have used their houses as collateral for the trip, taking out loans to pay their smugglers.

According to DHS officials, 3 percent of Huehuetenango’s entire population has left for the United States in the past seven months.

[This U.S.-funded school is trying to keep Guatemalans from migrating. Is it working?]

In the border city of La Mesilla, just south of the Mexican state of Chiapas, some migrants arrive at night at the local bus terminal, where they look for smugglers to hire. Nearby hotels — including the Texas Hotel, named for some of the migrants’ destination —cater to families on their way north. Many leave La Mesilla by truck and van, arriving at unmarked border crossings, not far from main highway corridors.

U.S. authorities have apprehended more than 100,000 migrants crossing the border from Mexico in each of the past three months, and unauthorized border crossings have soared to their highest level in at least 12 years. McAleenan told reporters Thursday that border agents are processing an average of 4,500 people each day, an increase of more than 30 percent since March, when he declared that U.S. agents and infrastructure had hit “the breaking point.”

In rural Guatemala, there is a widespread belief that bringing a child on the journey to the United States will make it easier to avoid detention and deportation. U.S. courts have limited the amount of time children can be held in immigration jails to 20 days, and because U.S. authorities can’t process their asylum claims that fast, the families are typically issued a court appointment and released into the U.S. interior.

“That’s the thing everyone knows now. If you go, you need to bring a child,” said Juan Vasquez, from La Libertad, who is considering migrating with his two daughters in coming weeks. “You can bring someone else’s child, but they say they are now doing DNA tests on the border, which make it difficult.”

Many Guatemalans say they have been told the ability to enter the United States with a child is part of an official U.S. policy that is due to expire in about a year; such rumors are often spread by smugglers trying to drum up business. “It’s something that they say is going to expire,” said Anselmo Torres, 58, also from La Libertad, whose two daughters migrated earlier this year with children of their own.

The United States has no such policy, but Trump last year ordered an end to family separations of migrants apprehended at the border after his “zero tolerance” crackdown triggered a ferocious backlash. He has since insisted the family separations would have worked as a deterrent if he had kept them in place.

At least nine people accused of human smuggling were arrested in Guatemala City on Wednesday, part of a joint operation between DHS and Guatemalan authorities, according to Guatemalan officials. It was the first such joint operation after the signing of the memorandum.

At the scene of the arrest, officials wearing jackets emblazoned with the acronym for “Homeland Security Investigations” — a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — were seen standing next to Guatemalan police officers.

[Trump pushes ahead with plan to slap Mexico with tariffs]

U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said he met with Guatemala’s ambassador to the United States, Manuel Espina, and that Espina told him Guatemala would welcome U.S. troops to help secure its northern border. After the meeting, Gonzalez wrote a letter to President Trump, urging him to accept the offer. The letter, asking for the United States to send military personnel, was obtained by The Washington Post.

“Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales has indicated that he would welcome the introduction of U.S. troops on Guatemala’s northern border,” Gonzalez wrote on April 16. “If you want to see fewer apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, I would strongly encourage you to seriously consider President Morales’ offer.”

Gonzalez said he believes sending 100 U.S. agents to Guatemala would be insufficient, and he would continue pushing to send U.S. military forces to Guatemala, with Morales’s approval, “on a humanitarian mission to help secure Guatemala’s border.”

Gonzalez said he did not receive a response from the White House.

Titled the Commission on Unalienable Rights, the new body will provide Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, with advice and recommendations concerning international human rights issues.

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” the State Department announced on Thursday.

The terms “natural law” and “natural rights” are sometimes invoked by conservatives espousing Christian values, and, according to director of the ACLU human rights programme Jamil Dakwar, have a history of association with racism and discrimination.

The panel, described as “necessary and in the public interest” by the department, is expected to meet at least once a month.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Politico quoted Mr Pompeo as saying the panel would help “connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world”.

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said.

He added the panel would be “deeply connected” to the department’s existing bureau dedicated to human rights, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Mr Dakwar told The Independent the commission’s mandate was “vague and even suspicious”, particularly its invocation of “fresh thinking” and natural law.

“It invokes questions about whether this administration is interested … to make maybe torture permissible, or expand the use of the death penalty, redefine what human rights are to limit the use of them in the context of women’s rights and the access to their bodies, and in the context of reproductive rights.”

He added the idea of Christian values has been used in the past to discriminate against minorities including women and people in the LGBTQ+ community.

Mr Pompeo would likely use it as an attempt to “circumvent” the development of human rights and, like the White House’s use of “alternative facts”, attempt to introduce “alternative human rights”.

The commission comes after two years in which Donald Trump and his aides have demoted human rights as a core issue when conducting foreign policy.

It has largely ignored human rights abuses by allies such as Saudi Arabia, and has generally only invoked them to put pressure on adversaries such as Iran.

As well as rolling back funding for groups abroad which focus on female reproductive rights, the administration has also curtailed rights domestically, including for immigrants and LGBTQ+ people.

Washington DC director at Human Rights Watch, Sarah Margon, said the commission was “concerning” and that the White House’s recent history “doesn’t lend itself to a productive conversation that expands human rights”.

“If you look at the way this administration has engaged in human rights over the past 18 months to two years there is no real reason to be hopeful,"" she said.

"In Terrifying Interview, William Barr Goes Full MAGA",http://nymag.com,['Jonathan Chait'],05-31-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/william-barr-interview-cbs-mueller-coup-trump.html,"Attorney General William Barr. Photo: CBS This Morning

After the legal Establishment had granted him the benefit of the doubt, Attorney General William Barr has shocked his erstwhile supporters with his aggressive and frequently dishonest interventions on behalf of President Trump. The spectacle of an esteemed lawyer abetting his would-be strongman boss’s every authoritarian instinct has left Barr’s critics grasping for explanations. Some have seized on the darker threads of his history in the Reagan and Bush administrations, when he misled the public about a secret Department of Justice memo and helped cover up the Iran-Contra scandal.

But Barr’s long, detailed interview with Jan Crawford suggests the rot goes much deeper than a simple mania for untrammeled Executive power. Barr has drunk deep from the Fox News worldview of Trumpian paranoia.

It is hard to convey how far over the edge Barr has gone without reading the entire interview, which lasted an hour. But a few key comments illustrate the depth of his investment in Trump’s perspective.

Barr, as he has done repeatedly, provides a deeply misleading account of what Robert Mueller found. “He did not reach a conclusion,” he says. “He provided both sides of the issue, and … his conclusion was he wasn’t exonerating the president, but he wasn’t finding a crime either.”

As Mueller stated in the report and again at his press conference, he felt bound by a policy preventing him from charging the president with a crime, or even saying the president had committed a crime. Mueller’s view is that his job vis-à-vis presidential misconduct is to describe the behavior and leave it up to Congress to decide if it’s a crime. Several hundred former federal prosecutors have stated, and Mueller clearly signaled, the actions he described in the Mueller report are crimes, or would be if the president could be charged with a crime.

Later in the interview, Barr grossly contradicts Mueller’s findings with regard to Trump’s ties to Russia. “Mueller has spent two and half years, and the fact is, there is no evidence of a conspiracy,” he says. “So it was bogus, this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.”

This is just a wild lie. Mueller was unable to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia. He was unable to establish this, in part, because “some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right,” or “provided information that was false or incomplete,” or “deleted relevant communications.” Indeed, the two Trump campaign officials most closely linked to Russian cutouts, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, refused to cooperate with prosecutors. A failure to establish a criminal conspiracy is not the same thing as finding “no evidence of a conspiracy.” Nowhere does the Mueller report say there’s no evidence of a conspiracy. Some of the potential conspiracy elements were unprovable — Mueller never figured out why Manafort gave 75 pages of polling data to a Russian agent.

Barr, amazingly, goes even farther to say the report proved “this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.” In fact, the Mueller report notes that it did not even try to establish whether the campaign was “in cahoots” with Russia. The report states that it “applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of ‘collusion.’”

The report in fact finds extensive evidence that Trump was in cahoots with Russia. His top campaign officials took a meeting with a Russian agent promising them help from the Russian government. Trump asked Russia on camera to hack his opponent’s emails, and they carried out a hacking attempt that day. Trump was pursuing a lucrative, no-risk business deal requiring Russian government approval during the campaign and lying about it, making him vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. Sharing an explosive secret that could destroy your campaign in order to potentially collect a massive payoff from a party that you know is doing illegal things to help you is the definition of being in cahoots.

Barr goes on to repeat Trump’s obsession with texts capturing the political chatter of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two romantically-involved FBI agents. “It’s hard to read some of the texts with and not feel that there was gross bias at work, and they’re appalling,” he tells Crawford.

There is, in fact, nothing unusual about FBI agents expressing political opinions. An investigation by the FBI’s Inspector General “did not find evidence to connect the political views expressed in these messages to the specific investigative decisions that we reviewed.” And no serious person doubts the overall weight of political opinion at the FBI leans rightward. The bureau has never had a Democratic director, and James Comey testified that, during the campaign, agents appeared to be leaking heavily to Rudy Giuliani. (Comey violated policy by scolding Clinton, and then publicly reopening the investigation, in part due to the pressure of the leaks from the FBI’s pro-Trump cabal.) Barr’s depiction of the FBI as a bastion of anti-Trump sentiment is grossly at odds with the evidence.

Even more astonishingly, Barr proceeds from that false premise to liken the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of Trump to right-wing birther conspiracies:

I think if the shoe was on the other foot we could be hearing a lot about it. If those kinds of discussions were held, you know, when Obama first ran for office, people talking about Obama in those tones and suggesting that “Oh that he might be a Manchurian candidate for Islam or something like that.” You know some wild accusations like that and you had that kind of discussion back and forth, you don’t think we would be hearing a lot more about it?

By likening the Russia scandal to birther conspiracies, Barr is tracking the arguments made by the most fanatical members of the pro-Trump commentariat, who treat it as a complete hoax. In fact, the Trump campaign had dozens and dozens of contacts with Russians, cultivating and relying on their hidden and sometimes illegal support. For Barr to liken these connections to a completely fabricated theory about Obama as a secret Muslim agent boggles the mind.

Barr portrays the Russia investigation as an effort to overturn Trump’s election:

I mean, republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state. And you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they’re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.

This is Trump’s own favorite conspiracy theory, dressed up in more elevated language than Trump himself can muster — “Praetorian Guard mentality” — but making the same ugly charge that the FBI plotted an illegal coup to stop Trump’s election.

Barr hints repeatedly throughout the interview that he has seen secret evidence he cannot share that supports his sinister conclusion. “I have not gotten answers that are well satisfactory, and in fact probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that I’ve learned don’t hang together with the official explanations of what happened,” he says. “That’s all I really will say. Things are just not jiving.”

It is impossible to disprove Barr’s claim to have uncovered a secret cabal to defeat Trump. But one might wonder why this cabal chose to infiltrate Trump’s campaign in an effort to smear him as a Russian stooge, and then fail to use the dirt before the election. Indeed, even as reporters were probing Trump’s growing swath of shady Russia ties, the FBI was aggressively spinning the opposite story to the media. The New York Times reported this spin in a now-infamous story asserting “No clear link to Russia,” and “even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.”

Barr’s theory is that a partisan cabal of rabid Trump-haters decided to undermine his campaign by ginning up a phony scandal that they kept secret, even lying to the media, is like the Dr. Strangelove Soviet Doomsday machine. (The device deterred a nuclear first strike by automatically launching a response, but the Soviets neglected to tell the United States because “the Premier loves surprises.”)

The most frighteningly clarifying comment comes at the end, when Barr lays out his belief that President Trump poses no threat whatsoever to democratic norms. The threat is the “resistance”:

I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it’s President Trump that’s shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that, it is hard, and I really haven’t seen … particulars as to how that’s being done. From my perspective the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and, you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that we have to stop this president, that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring.

In fact, the opposition to Trump has been marked, on the whole, by its fastidious restraint. At times Barr has used their restraint against them. Because Mueller believed his role prevents him from labeling Trump’s actions crimes, Barr says Mueller couldn’t decide if they were criminal or not. He says the relatively mild steps taken to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia during the campaign prove the concerns couldn’t have been serious. (“I’m wondering what exactly was the response to it if they were alarmed,” he sneers to Crawford. “Surely the response should have been more than just, you know, dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump campaign.”) If the FBI was investigating Trump, it proves they were out to get him, but if they tread lightly, it proves Trump was innocent.

As far as Barr is concerned, Trump has done nothing wrong, and all the shredding of norms has been done against him, not by him. Trump’s calls to jail all his opponents, his non-stop lies, his demands to punish independent media and satirists, his open conviction that law enforcement should operate at his personal command and follow him loyally, not to mention the repeated obstruction of justice detailed by Mueller — none of it concerns Barr even slightly.

Everything Barr has said and done during this investigation tells us he is not lying about this belief. The terrifying truth is that he all but surely believes every word."
US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan were the top importers of freedom gas last year. China, India, and the UK buy a smaller number of molecules of US freedom."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
Mueller’s punt keeps looking worse,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/31/18645173/mueller-report-barr-trump-obstruction,"Robert Mueller’s report makes the stirring claim that “a fundamental principle of our government” is that no person, not even the president, “is above the law.”

But the special counsel’s ultimate legacy may well be the exact opposite — because of his controversial decision not to say whether Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice.

“We concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said in his statement Wednesday, reiterating his report’s explanation.

It was the punt heard around the world. It may have been the crucial turning point in the saga of the special counsel probe, and perhaps the decision most likely to have ramifications for future presidents. It effectively “removes the president from the scope of generally applicable criminal laws,” Cornell law professor Jens David Ohlin recently told my colleague Sean Illing.

Essentially, Mueller has laid out a model that federal prosecutors can investigate the sitting president for crimes, but that they should not make any conclusion about whether he committed a crime. In a sense, this does seem to place the president above the law.

To be clear — this was Mueller’s own choice. Yes, he did conclude that existing department policy prevented him from indicting a sitting president. But before the special counsel wrapped up his work, it was widely believed that he might still issue a judgment on whether Trump committed a crime.

He did not do so, and this “took some constitutional scholars and Justice Department veterans by surprise,” the Washington Post’s Rosalind Helderman wrote Wednesday. Helderman quotes J. Michael Luttig, a former appellate judge and former Justice Department official, saying: “The fact that a president cannot be prosecuted does not foreclose a finding by a special counsel of whether a president committed a crime.”

Oddly, Mueller also went out of his way, both in his report and his statement, to opine that he did not have “confidence” that Trump didn’t break the law. And his legal analyses of certain incidents involving Trump sure seem to suggest he violated the law. But he refused to take the final step and outright come to a conclusion — something Attorney General William Barr has repeatedly said he expected the special counsel to do.

Mueller was also careful never to say that he couldn’t have issued a criminal finding about Trump. In the report, he writes several times that his office “determined” not to do this, and in his Wednesday statement he used the word “concluded.” Additionally, Barr proceeded to ignore this considered decision not to decide, quickly issuing his own conclusion that, in his view, Trump didn’t violate the law.

Still, Mueller’s decision-making around the highest-profile criminal investigation into a president in decades is unmistakably important, and could be viewed as a model for similar future investigations to follow. So we deserve more transparency about how it came about.

Mueller’s reasoning for choosing not to say whether President Trump broke the law

For a report that’s 448 pages long, Mueller’s decision to end his investigation of Trump with a punt is somewhat under-explained.

The special counsel lays it out quickly in the introduction of his report’s second volume. First, he writes, he “accepted” the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel’s 2000 opinion that the department can’t indict a sitting president because it would undermine his capacity to carry out the work of the executive branch. Second, the report continues, the office determined that investigating the president “is permissible” anyway, to preserve evidence, and because the president wouldn’t have immunity from indictment after he leaves office. So far, that’s all as expected.

But then comes the punt. Though the office “considered” whether to evaluate Trump’s conduct under Justice Department standards about prosecution decisions, Mueller writes, it “determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.”

And his main reason is a curious one — that it would be unfair to the president, because the fact that he can’t be charged means he can’t clear his name with an acquittal at trial.

Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges can be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, offers no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.

Mueller reiterated this point in his statement Wednesday. “Beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness,” he said. “It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge.” In the report, he refers to this as the “absence of a neutral adjudicatory forum” to review the report’s findings.

Mueller expresses another concern in the report as well — namely, that finding the president committed a crime in an internal report “could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.” Specifically, it could “imperil the President’s ability to govern.”

So, Mueller said in his statement: “We concluded that we would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the president committed a crime. That is the office’s final position.”

Mueller’s move sets a worrying precedent

Even though Mueller made clear this was his own decision, it will inevitably set a precedent for future investigations into presidents — a problematic one.

If Mueller’s approach is taken as a model, the Justice Department can investigate to their heart’s content, but at the end of the day, they not only won’t indict a sitting president, but they won’t even say whether he broke the law.

It’s the very definition of special treatment, and would essentially remove one potential check on presidential wrongdoing from within the executive branch. It would mean the department charged with investigating and charging violations of federal law won’t assess whether one particular person, the president, violated federal law.

Mueller’s concern about “fairness” to the president, who would lack a forum to clear his name after being accused, is particularly odd.

“That is completely absurd,” Ohlin, the law professor, told Illing. “The president doesn’t have a courtroom to vindicate his innocence only because the DOJ has decided that his office makes him immune from indictment in the first place. It’s a piece of circular reasoning that removes the president from the scope of generally applicable criminal laws.”

The special counsel appears to realize the implications of this position, so in an apparent attempt to mitigate it, he does offer an opinion on Trump’s conduct — that it’s, well, not obviously innocent.

“If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller writes in his report’s final paragraph.

Indeed, many who have read the report closely have remarked that its legal analysis often seems quite damning for Trump. Lawfare’s Quinta Jurecic, for example, parsed the report’s language about several examples of Trump’s potentially obstructive conduct, with an eye toward whether it established all three legal elements of criminal obstruction of justice. For four examples, the report seems to do just that. Hundreds of federal prosecutors have also opined that Trump’s conduct as outlined in the report would merit charges if he wasn’t president.

But in the end, Mueller, the person who was charged with investigating whether the president of the United States violated the law, refused to outright make a judgment on whether he did. And if, in the future, Justice Department investigators are looking into a sitting president’s potentially criminal conduct, they might feel obligated to follow his example and do the same, rather than rocking the boat.

This wasn’t the obvious call — and Barr quickly made a different call

Again, Mueller did not conclude that he was prohibited from making a criminal finding about the president. He says he “considered” doing so. It’s just that he concluded that he wouldn’t.

This was far from a foregone conclusion, it certainly came as a surprise to me and others who have covered Mueller’s investigation for years.

Attorney General William Barr, for instance, testified that he was “frankly surprised” to learn this in March and that he “did not understand exactly why the special counsel was not reaching a decision.”

Indeed, Barr proceeded to do exactly what Mueller wouldn’t — evaluating the evidence and concluding that, in his view, it wasn’t sufficient to establish Trump committed a crime. So, in a sense, Mueller’s considered decision not to decide was immediately thrown out the window by his superior.

“The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office,” Barr told CBS News this week. “But he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.”

Mueller may have had other reasons for restraint

Perhaps hanging over all this is the fact that, if Mueller had submitted a report to Barr concluding that Trump committed a crime, it would have initiated a crisis.

Mueller would have been the man who threw the Justice Department into turmoil, as the department would inevitably have struggled with how to handle such an explosive conclusion. (Remember that Barr was not legally obligated to make Mueller’s findings public.)

Once the news inevitably got out, Mueller would likely have become the man who lit the impeachment fuse. Congressional Democratic leaders are having enough difficulty holding off their base’s desire to impeach Trump as it is. An unambiguous conclusion from Mueller that Trump violated the law would have led to pressure that may well have been impossible for them to withstand.

It’s possible Mueller believes that’s a decision that should be made by Congress, not a Justice Department prosecutor. The House of Representatives is essentially the “prosecutor” in the impeachment process — they can vote to kick-start a trial in the Senate. He might have envisioned his job as limited to gathering evidence and presenting some analysis.

But when Mueller’s report does reference impeachment, he seems concerned about interfering with that process. A “criminal accusation against a sitting President,” he writes, could “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.” (A footnote there makes clear he means impeachment). So essentially, Mueller has ceded the role of deciding whether the president committed a crime to Congress.

There may also have been features of the case itself that made Mueller prefer restraint. He didn’t establish an underlying conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to interfere with the election. And despite all his troubling obstruction evidence, he lacked an indisputable smoking gun example, like Trump outright telling witnesses to lie to investigators or destroying evidence.

But his decision really deserves more transparency and debate

In the end, Mueller’s decision not to make a criminal finding one way or the other may be the most crucial decision he made during his investigation — and we should really get more transparency about it.

When did the special counsel decide on this approach, exactly? What was the debate over it like? How close was he to going in a different direction? What sort of internal analyses were written on this topic? Was his decision based on the particular circumstances of this case, or would his reasoning apply to all similar investigations? Should the new standard be that the Justice Department never opines on whether the president has violated the law?

It’s understandable that Mueller doesn’t want to testify before Congress about uncharged individuals and uncharged conduct, as per Justice Department practice. But this is a process call that could have major consequences for future investigations of presidents, and accordingly deserves a good deal more review and debate.

Considering how consequential this decision may have been, the few paragraphs about this in Mueller’s report simply aren’t enough — nor are his brief remarks this week. His decision poses the risk that future investigations of presidents will be hamstrung from the start. So he should give a better explanation of why he made this call."
Senators urge USDA to stop foreign-owned companies from getting farm bailout money,https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/1354690-Senators-urge-USDA-to-stop-foreign-owned-companies-from-getting-farm-bailout-money,"WASHINGTON - A group of U.S. senators is urging Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ensure that a bailout program intended to help American farmers weather President Donald Trump's trade war does not benefit foreign-owned companies.

The program, which buys surplus commodities from farmers and ranchers, was pitched as a way to protect farmers during the U.S.-China trade war. But the USDA hasn't turned away foreign-owned corporations that want in. Earlier this year, taxpayer money was used to buy $5 million in pork products from a Brazilian-owned meatpacking firm. A Chinese-owned pork producer was slated to tap the program until the contract provoked intense criticism and was eventually canceled.

""It is unacceptable that American taxpayers have been subsidizing our competitors through trade assistance,"" according to a letter addressed to Perdue and signed by Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and eight other Democratic lawmakers. ""We ask that you ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer's bottom line - not the business interests of foreign corporations.""

Under a $12 billion bailout program announced last year, the Trump administration set aside $1.2 billion to buy surplus products from farmers, including more than $500 million from pork producers. Last week, the White House announced a separate $16 billion bailout that included $1.4 billion in commodity purchase relief for farmers.

The letter's other signatories are Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

The senators pointed to what they called ""lucrative"" contracts that benefit foreign-owned entities and direct taxpayer money abroad. Those contracts include $62.5 million in pork products from JBS USA, which is owned by Brazil-based JBS SA. The food purchase program also was slated to buy $240,000 in pork products from Smithfield Foods, which is a subsidiary of Chinese-owned WH Group. Smithfield later asked that the contract be canceled after a political backlash. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a farmer and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was among those who expressed alarm that a foreign-owned company could benefit from the bailout. (The USDA said it has not tallied how much money has gone to foreign-owned companies, but the contracts themselves are public.)

""Whether it's the WH Group, which is closely tied to the Chinese government, or JBS SA, which is benefiting from the U.S's loss of market share in certain countries, it is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this Administration's trade policy,"" the senators wrote.

Perdue contends the program already buys only American-made products.

""JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers,"" Perdue said in a statement. ""What we do through these companies - it's not to help the companies - they offer a bid to us based on buying us farmers production. This helps U.S. farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.""

Dustin Baker, director of economics for the National Pork Producers Council, cautioned against limiting which pork producers could take advantage of the food purchasing program. Baker said that reducing the number of producers trying to get relief would only drive up the delivery costs of getting the products to food banks and needy families.

Plus, Baker said, just because some producers are foreign-owned doesn't mean they can't be ""the lifeblood of the economies in which they're located."" Many of these companies provide thousands of jobs in rural areas and, like their American-owned competitors, they must also comply with USDA guidelines, he said.

""The real purpose [of the program] is to take product off the domestic market that otherwise would have been exported,"" Baker said. ""By preventing companies from joining, all you're doing is increasing the cost of delivering that product to those who need it the most.""

In January, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said she would introduce the Buy American Agriculture Act, which would require the Agricultural Marketing Service to only buy food products from American companies. The legislation would also push for added transparency by requiring the agency to disclose why companies were awarded contracts.

""We were led to believe this program would assist producers impacted by low crop prices, not line the pockets of foreign companies who already report millions of dollars in annual profits,"" DeLauro in a statement at the time. ""The Buy American Agriculture Act would close that loophole and ensure that money spent by USDA on food purchases rightly prioritizes America's farmers and American businesses.""

"DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-ex-fbi-official-leaked-sensitive-info-improperly-accepted-gift-from-media,"The Justice Department's watchdog said a high-ranking FBI official leaked ""sensitive"" information to reporters multiple times without authorization and had improperly accepted a gift from the media.

A one-page report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz released Wednesday concluded that a now-former deputy assistant director with the FBI “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

Despite these violations of FBI policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined.”

The investigation was initiated by the Office of the Inspector General in response to allegations from the FBI, and the inspector general said that it is now “providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action.”

When the Washington Examiner reached out to the DOJ inspector general’s office for further information about the investigation, including the identity of the unnamed deputy assistant director, a senior counsel said to file a Freedom of Information Act request with their office.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Sen. Chuck Grassley told Attorney General William Barr “there have been a number of leaks coming out of the Justice Department and FBI during high-profile investigations” and that “leaks undermine the ability of investigators to investigate.” Barr assured him that “we have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”

[ Related: Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok]

The inspector general said in its report Wednesday that the investigation stemmed from one of many episodes referenced in the office’s bombshell 2018 report titled “Review of Allegations Regarding Various Actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Advance of the 2016 Election.” That inspector general inquiry, which focused on the conduct of the DOJ and FBI during the “Midyear Exam” investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, concluded that members of both the department and the bureau acted improperly.

The 568-page tome that dropped nearly a year ago described “a culture of unauthorized media contacts” within the FBI and had a section focused on “dozens of FBI employees that had contact with members of the media,"" many in violation of FBI policies. Horowitz said “the harm caused by leaks” and “the fear of potential leaks” actually “influenced FBI officials who were advising then Director Comey on consequential investigative decisions in October 2016.”

The 2018 report said investigators “identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.” Horowitz said “we do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,” but instead “we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.”

A February 2018 report from Horowitz found former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had improperly disclosed information to the Wall Street Journal confirming the existence of a Clinton Foundation investigation. That report determined McCabe “lacked candor” when speaking with former FBI Director James Comey, with the FBI’s Internal Investigations Section, and with the Office of the Inspector General. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 just a couple days before he was set to retire.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who has been making the rounds on cable news shows defending his role in the Trump-Russia investigation and his handling of the Steele dossier over the past few weeks, recently confirmed the existence of a likely criminal leaks investigation into him, but declined to provide many specifics. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal,"" Baker said. That probe was handled by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was recently picked by Barr to head up the investigation of the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia probe.

Besides looking into criminal leaks, Horowitz is also handling a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation that is expected to wrap up in May or June."
Elizabeth Warren Wants to Ensure That Sitting Presidents Can Be Indicted for Criminal Activity,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Gideon Resnick'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-ensure-that-sitting-presidents-can-be-indicted-for-criminal-activity,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is proposing changes to Department of Justice policy that preclude presidents from being indicted, following a public statement from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in which he said that very policy effectively prevented him from making a final determination as to whether President Trump broke the law. “Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,” Warren wrote in a Medium post this morning. “And when I’m president, I’ll appoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no president is shielded from criminal accountability.”

She wants Congress to pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict any president of the United States, amend obstruction-of-justice statutes to allow for indictment when the “president abuses the powers of the office,” and appoint an assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel who will reverse OLC opinion arguing that presidents cannot be indicted. Warren was one of the earliest in the field to call for impeachment proceedings last month when the Mueller Report came out."

When former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declared that indicting a sitting president was “unconstitutional,” some legal experts were taken aback. The question has never been litigated and so never decided by the Supreme Court.

The reality, as Mueller said in the same breath — making his first public comments Wednesday on his Russia investigation — is that the prohibition on charging presidents with federal crimes is “long-standing department policy.” It was formulated in two opinions during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

The opinions of this elite corps of lawyers are binding on the federal government — but are not the equivalent of Supreme Court rulings.

[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinion]

For these lawyers are not “umpires,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. once described the role of Supreme Court justices. They are the president’s lawyers, whose stated responsibilities include “facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law.”

The body of opinions they produce have been called “the law that presidents make.”

And it is no surprise that such law holds that presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Friday in a blog post that as president, she would seek a reversal of that Justice Department policy. “When I’m elected, I will exercise my constitutional authority to appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one — not even a President — is above the law,” she said.

While the OLC is proud of its “independent and principled” judgment, a recent Cornell Law Review study of its work, as well as a review of its publicly available decisions, suggests that it has a hard time saying “no” to its chief client.

The yeses accumulate. And because the Supreme Court tends to stay away from separation-of-powers issues, an OLC opinion becomes precedent for the next OLC opinion on the same subject, and the next one and the one after that.

Before long, it’s all settled as far as the Justice Department is concerned.

That’s how White House claims of “executive privilege” have evolved. What began as a few historical examples of withheld information by a handful of presidents and a passing acknowledgment in the Supreme Court’s 1974 Watergate tapes case, U.S. v. Nixon, is now routinely invoked by presidents as fundamental law.

The OLC’s recent opinion supporting President Trump’s barring of House Judiciary Committee testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn is illustrative, citing “nearly five decades” of OLC precedent in support of Trump’s claim.

Similarly, the OLC cited prior opinions and “centuries of historical practice and precedents” in addition to its interpretation of the law, when it determined that Trump could name Matthew G. Whitaker acting attorney general, temporarily replacing Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that Whitaker had held no position confirmed by the Senate.

“Some people have described it as a one-way ratchet,” said Jonathan Shaub, who served in the OLC from 2014 through the summer of 2017. “A president does something. The next president comes along and says, ‘I can do this other thing that’s just a step further.’ ”

The OLC’s precedent, Shaub said, “sets the stage for future presidents, and most favor executive branch authority.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.

Unlike a court, the OLC’s opinion-making process is neither neutral, adversarial nor transparent. Much of its work is kept secret. Some is informal, according to lawyers who have worked there, consisting of emails and purely oral communications.

All this is among the reasons executive branch power keeps expanding, often at the expense of Congress, particularly in areas involving war powers and national security.

On occasion, precedent doesn’t matter so much. The most recent example of that came when the OLC said the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as adviser to the president, did not run afoul of federal nepotism laws.

The decision, dated on Trump’s Inauguration Day, ran contrary to at least four earlier OLC opinions on similar questions.

The office said it had “reexamined the legislative materials” on nepotism. (The federal anti-nepotism law was enacted after Bobby Kennedy served as attorney general to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and did not apply to Hillary Clinton, who served as health-care adviser to her husband, because a court ruled the first lady was a “de facto” White House official.)

The most famous reversal was the revocation by the OLC in 2004 of the “torture memos” authorized by the same office for the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

For a Cornell Law Review article, scholar Adoree Kim compared the OLC’s publicly released decisions advising executive branch agencies with those advising the White House and found a sharp divergence. While the office often felt free to say “no” to agency legal interpretations, it was far more obliging to the White House.

“The OLC is deeply deferential to the President and to presidential action,” she wrote, and “this deference is not unique to times of crisis. It is also not limited to the realm of foreign affairs, or to constitutional questions. Rather, the OLC demonstrates systematic partiality toward the President.” The office, she concluded, is indeed the “president’s law firm.”

But “as a practical matter,” said Walter Dellinger, who ran the office for three years under President Bill Clinton, “it is difficult to cut back on opinions expanding executive power,” though it can and has been done.

Deference to the president “is baked into OLC’s culture,” former OLC lawyer Erica Newland wrote recently in The Washington Post. It “proceeds from the assumption that the president is acting consistent with Article II of the Constitution and with his oath of office, both of which require that he ‘faithfully’ execute the laws.”

“But when I was at OLC, I saw again and again how the decision to trust the president failed the office’s attorneys, the Justice Department and the American people. The failure took different forms,” she wrote. “Sometimes, we just wouldn’t look that closely at the claims the president was making about the state of the world. When we did look closely, we could give only nudges.”

Newland left the office in November. “I decided that the responsibilities entailed in my oath were incompatible with the expectations of my job,” she wrote."
Spray cheese would count as food stamp staple under Trump administration proposal,https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposal-would-count-spray-cheese-beef-jerky-staple-foods/,"A new policy proposed by the Trump administration would allow foods like spray cheese to be considered ""staples"" for federal food stamps. Staple foods are important to the food stamps program, officially known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), as regulations require SNAP retailers to stock a certain number of these food staples.

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores, which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official

[Related: DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media]

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

[Also read: DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says]

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"
U.S. Officials Meet in Secret Over Junk-Loan Frenzy as Recession Alarms Flash,https://www.thestreet.com,['Bradley Keoun'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/as-recession-warnings-flash-top-officials-meet-in-secret-over-junk-loan-frenzy-14977371,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday led a secret meeting of top U.S. financial regulators on the risks to global markets from the recent surge in corporate borrowing -- a growing concern as fears mount that the economy might be headed for a slowdown or a recession.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, formed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to prevent a repeat, met ""in executive session,"" or behind closed doors, according to a statement released by the Treasury Department's public-affairs unit following the meeting.

Members of the group include Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as well as the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

No details were provided on the gist of the discussion, though according to the statement the panel heard an ""update"" from Craig Phillips, a counselor to Mnuchin, on recent market developments involving ""corporate credit and leveraged lending.""

Leveraged lending is the financial industry's term for the practice of making loans to companies with poor credit ratings, colloquially known as junk. Historically, the market was dominated by banks, but in recent years investment firms and other non-bank lenders joined in; the outstanding amount of the loans has mushroomed over the past decade to about $1.2 trillion, eclipsing the more-established junk-bond market.

There's also been a surge in borrowing by companies with triple-B ratings, which rank just above junk but could face dire downgrades if an economic slowdown shrinks profits for those borrowers. That category of debt has climbed to an unprecedented level of more than $3 trillion, according to Standard & Poor's, sparking warnings from officials including Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

The concern is that if the economy falters, loan losses would climb dramatically and other companies would be more likely to default on their outstanding bonds.

Minutes from the Financial Stability Oversight Council's March 6 meeting, released Thursday, show that Ted Berg, a Treasury Department researcher, warned panel members that even the non-junk debt could see $300 million to $1 trillion of credit-rating downgrades during the next downturn.

Since then, President Donald Trump's trade war with China has intensified, casting a pall over global markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that the president's new tariffs could add about $800 to the average household's annual costs while hurting business sales and potentially pushing the U.S. into its first recession in a decade.

""Credit stresses are multiplying,"" analysts at Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, wrote last week in a report. ""Reduced risk appetite leads to restricted capital access, which in turn has the potential to set the stage for elevated distress and eventual defaults.""

In recent days, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have slipped below those on shorter-term bills and notes -- an unusual phenomenon known as a ""yield-curve inversion"" since investors usually demand higher returns to compensate for the extra risk that comes with a longer payback period. It's often seen as a classic sign of an impending recession.

The borrowing binge by U.S. companies has garnered so much attention from investors lately that Powell, the Fed chairman, devoted an entire speech to the topic on May 20. He said there's currently a ""moderate"" risk that business debt triggers a full-blown financial crisis, although ""the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens.""

""Once again, we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards,"" Powell said.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a branch of the Treasury Department that supervises national banks, wrote in a May 20 report that ""years of growth, incremental easing in underwriting, risk layering and building credit concentrations result in accumulated risk.""

The corporate-lending surge has been fueled by firms like Blackstone (BX - Get Report) and Apollo Global Management (APO - Get Report) , which rely on junk-grade loans to finance the acquisitions they make through their private-investment funds.

In recent years, the firms have also waded into the corporate-lending business themselves and they now routinely package junk loans into new bonds known as ""collateralized loan obligations,"" or CLOs -- some with pristine triple-A ratings that can be easily sold on to investors with promises of attractive yields.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and declared 2020 presidential candidate, has likened the process to Wall Street's assembly-line-style packaging of subprime mortgages into triple-A rated bonds in the years before the 2008 crisis.

Indeed, with U.S. banks facing tighter scrutiny over the past decade, the private-equity industry has had almost free rein to take over a bigger portion of the financial markets. The five biggest private-equity firms, including Powell's former employer, Carlyle Group, now manage some $1.37 trillion of client money overall, based on a tally by TheStreet.

Mnuchin and other Treasury officials have proposed to exempt these ""non-bank firms"" from getting designated as ""systemically important"" -- a label that would subject them to much tougher oversight. Instead, regulators would supervise the firms' ""activities.""

According to Thursday's statement, the oversight council ""heard a presentation from Treasury staff"" on public comments submitted in response to Mnuchin's proposal.

The presentation wasn't released, but the comments are publicly available on a government website. They include a May 13 letter to Mnuchin from the American Investment Council, the main U.S. trade association for private-equity firms, advocating for the exemption.

Yet there's still powerful opposition -- from the likes of former Treasury secretaries Timothy Geithner and Jacob Lew as well as former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.

""Regulation, of course, carries burdens for individual firms, but these consequences have to be measured against the tragic and indiscriminate costs of a crisis,"" they wrote to Mnuchin and Powell in a joint letter, also dated May 13."
EPA finalizes plan to expand ethanol use,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-finalizes-plan-expand-ethanol-gasoline-summer/story?id=63397761,"Gasoline that contains a higher percentage of ethanol should be available to drivers around the country this summer, the Trump administration announced Friday.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to lift limits on the amount of ethanol in gasoline, saying it will expand the market for biofuels and generate a win for corn producers. Industry groups also said it will help the biofuel industry and give consumers more options at the pump.

“As President Trump promised, EPA is approving the year-round sale of E15 in time for summer driving season, giving drivers more choices at the pump,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release.

Trump said he would ask for the change at a campaign rally last March, months before the midterm elections. Expanding ethanol is seen as a way to boost markets for corn produced in Midwestern states and benefit political candidates that support expanded ethanol production.

The head of EPA’s air office, Bill Wehrum, said the proposal helps support renewable fuels and addresses concerns from the oil industry about the regulation of biofuels.

The EPA originally set limits on gasoline with 15% ethanol because of concerns the higher temperatures in the summer could lead to more air pollution. But Wehrum said he doesn't expect a noticeable impact because gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold in the summer months.

""At the end of the day from an environmental standpoint this doesn't make any significant difference,"" he told reporters Friday.

Critics see the decision as an attempt by Trump to help farmers in the Midwest who have been hurt by the trade war with China and declining commodity prices. Corn growers have called for the administration to allow more ethanol and have opposed waivers from oil refineries exempting them from requirements to include a minimum amount of ethanol.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also applauded the decision in a statement, saying it will help farmers and consumers while the administration looks to grow the market for American-produced ethanol both in the U.S. and in other countries.

Many farmers are facing historic delays in planting corn crops due to severe flooding. Other efforts to help struggling farmers in states impacted by natural disasters have stalled in Congress."
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

Book review of Siege: Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Ryan Lizza'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-trip-inside-trumpworld-and-inside-the-presidents-head-with-bannon-as-guide/2019/05/29/7560ec12-8236-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html,"Steve Bannon served as White House chief strategist before being fired in August 2017. He hasn’t talked to President Trump since then, but he still has lots to say about his former boss. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Ryan Lizza is a senior political analyst for CNN and chief political correspondent for Esquire.

The author’s note that opens “Siege,” Michael Wolff’s sequel to “Fire and Fury” — which documented President Trump’s first year in office, much of it through the anonymous musings of Steve Bannon — reads like the scene-setting crawl at the start of a Star Wars movie. The reader learns that Wolff’s new account begins in February 2018, when the “president’s capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and methodical institutional response” and Trump’s “own government, even his own White House, has begun to turn on him.” Instead of cutting to Hoth, the distant ice planet in “The Empire Strikes Back” that’s home to the struggling rebellion, we soon cut to Bannon’s kitchen table.

Bannon has been driven out of the White House by Trump and dumped by his financial patrons, the Mercers. He has set up shop in a shabby Capitol Hill townhouse, theatrically known as the Embassy, which, it slowly becomes clear, might as well be Hoth. It takes 193 pages, but we eventually learn that Bannon hasn’t talked to Trump since he was fired.

That doesn’t prevent Wolff from centering the entire narrative on the president’s former aide. So the new Wolff book is much like the last one: a sail through the Trump diaspora and inside the president’s head with Bannon as the cruise director. But also like the last book, “Siege” is ultimately crippled by three flaws: Wolff’s overreliance on a single character, and one who is now more distant from the action; factual errors that mar the author’s credibility; and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable.

For long stretches of “Siege,” Trump and the White House staff disappear and the reader is subjected to a tedious ticktock of Bannon’s travels and his plotting from the Embassy, where he pontificates throughout 2018 about how the Republicans will win the midterms (they didn’t), how his nationalist project is still ascendant in the GOP (it isn’t), how Robert Mueller will destroy the Trump presidency (he didn’t), and how Bannon himself may have to replace Trump and run for president in 2020, with Sean Hannity as his running mate (we’ll have to wait for Episode III).

In the acknowledgments, Bannon is the only named source whom Wolff thanks, praising him effusively and, in an allusion to Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” calling him “the Virgil anyone might be lucky enough to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld.” In reality Bannon is more like Wolff’s Farinata, the former Florentine political leader whom Dante portrays as banished to the circle of hell for heretics, where, alone in his tomb, he still obsesses about his own era in politics but has no access to current events unless one of the dead brings him a snippet of news from the center of power.

In “Siege,” the dead arrive at Bannon’s doorstep in the form of former Trump aides such as Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, Sam Nunberg and Jason Miller, and Wolff, like many other Washington reporters, absorbs a mix of gossip, misinformation and occasional insight that the outer rings of Trump advisers are famous for circulating.

This rogues’ gallery of Trump hangers-on that Wolff seems to depend on is sometimes presented as a group of devoted ideological rebels trying to keep the flame of true MAGA alive. According to Wolff, several of them, usually working through Hannity, who has better access to the president, press Trump on issues like building the border wall or declaring a national emergency over immigration. Bossie and Lewandowski “weren’t operatives, they were believers,” Wolff credulously reports, a statement that will generate guffaws among Republicans. But mostly, Bannon’s knitting circle is involved in low-level score-settling — often against then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner — and making money off their association with Trump. Lewandowski and Bossie hawk a conspiracy book about the “deep state” even though, according to Wolff, Bannon tells their ghostwriter that “none of this is true.”

Wolff’s rebels and Trump are co-dependent but clear-eyed about each other. Trump, Wolff writes, likes Lewandowski more than his own sons, even though he derides him as an “ass kisser.” Trump says Bossie, who unsuccessfully maneuvers to become chief of staff, is “shifty.” Nunberg is mocked by the president for living with his parents, and Wolff quotes Trump remarking of Miller, “I get the people who no one else wants.”

Likewise, they have no illusions about Trump. Wolff summarizes the view of the president from the ragtag Embassy team: Trump is a “clown,” an “idiot” and a “nutter.”

Bannon’s core political project of attaining power by stoking racial resentment is left uncriticized by Wolff. (In case there is any doubt about this, Bannon tells Wolff: “If you voted for Trump, every picture of a Mexican immigrant, a parent or a child, together or apart, reconfirms that vote.”) Wolff’s obsession with documenting Bannon’s every thought, while remaining uninterested in the reality of the racial politics unleashed by him and Trump, reaches peak hilarity when he earnestly quotes Bannon’s dissection of whether the president is an anti-Semite (probably not) or a racist (probably). While many who have studied Trump — for a fraction of the time that Wolff has — have easily made up their minds on the issue, Wolff, who quotes Trump making racist and anti-Semitic remarks and calling Mexicans “wetbacks,” writes that whether he is a racist or not is “a rosebud riddle.”

However, Bannon’s frequently shrewd observations make it clear why Wolff finds him irresistible. The author is mostly interested in Trump’s psychology. He is adept at documenting the president’s lunacy, and Bannon is frequently an able fellow shrink. For example, he credibly theorizes that Trump’s inevitable disgust with anyone who works for him is a natural outgrowth of his alleged self-hatred. “Hating himself, he of course comes to hate anyone who seems to love him,” Bannon tells Wolff. “If you seem to respect him, he thinks he’s put something over on you — therefore you’re a fool.”

But the idea that Wolff is documenting some larger ideological struggle in the Trump GOP is mostly familiar Bannon spin. According to Wolff, Lewandowski reports that “he had almost wet himself” during a White House confrontation with Kelly, a former Marine, who grabbed Lewandowski by the collar outside the Oval Office. What Wolff leaves out about this well-known episode, first reported by the New York Times, is that Kelly was yelling at Lewandowski for trying to profit off Trump’s presidency. Wolff also ignores, perhaps because of his publishing deadline, that Bossie was officially excommunicated from Trumpworld in May when the Trump campaign suggested he was running a “scam group” that was “interested in filling their own pockets with money from innocent Americans’ paychecks.” Believers indeed.

Wolff’s broad conceptual error — that the real heart of Trumpism is heroically being kept alive by Bannon’s band of true-believing outsiders — would be forgivable if the book wasn’t marred by two more strikes: some cringeworthy errors, and sourcing that renders the extremely fun and juicy quotes sprinkled across every chapter as, sadly, difficult to trust.

Wolff reports that he had two fact-checkers assigned to the book, but they apparently weren’t enough. He writes that after Ty Cobb left the White House, Trump’s only lawyers were Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani (whom he describes as “drunk on a bid for further attention, or just drunk”). Wolff seems not to know that Trump hired Jane and Martin Raskin, whose names do not appear in the book, to deal with the Mueller probe. He writes that Russians hacked the email account of John Podesta and servers at the Democratic National Committee after July 27, 2016, the day Trump famously called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails. That’s wrong. The Podesta hack happened in March, the DNC hack happened in April, and the fruits of those hacks had already been released, which is why Trump made the comment.

Wolff observes that reporting on Trump is difficult because the president and many of the people who work for him or advise him lie indiscriminately. Other reporters have faced this dilemma by maximizing the number of sources needed to confirm the many rumors that swirl around Trump and by generally increasing transparency to retain reader trust in an environment where the president regularly attacks truthful reporting as fake.

Wolff takes a different approach. Dramatic scoops are plopped down on the page with no sourcing whatsoever. Would-be newsmaking quotes are often attributed to Trump and senior officials without any context about when or to whom they were made.

Wolff clearly relies on the work of dozens of other reporters on the Trump beat, but because he rarely uses any attributions, the reader never knows whether a fact he’s relaying comes from him or elsewhere. For example, he writes that Kushner was briefed by intelligence officials that his friend Wendi Deng might be a Chinese spy. The reader would be forgiven for thinking this was another Wolff scoop, rather than a major exclusive reported by the Wall Street Journal in early 2018.

The cutting comments Wolff attributes to Trump certainly sound like the president: “the stupidest man in Congress” and a “religious nut” (Mike Pence); “gives me the creeps” (Karen Pence); “feeble” (John Kelly); “a girl” (Kushner); “looks like a mental patient” (Giuliani); “a pretty stupid boy” who “has too many f---ing kids” (Donald Trump Jr.); “men’s shop salesmen” (Republican House candidates); “ignoramuses” (Trump’s communications team); “the only stupid Jew” (Michael Cohen); “a dirty rat” (former White House counsel Donald McGahn); a “virgin crybaby” who was “probably molested by a priest” (Brett Kavanaugh); “the poor man’s Ann Coulter” (Kellyanne Conway); “sweaty” (Stephen Miller). But the lack of sourcing transparency and footnotes does not inspire confidence.

By far the biggest scoop in the book is a document that Wolff alleges is a draft indictment, eventually ignored, of the president from inside the special counsel’s office. In addition to the alleged indictment, Wolff reports on several interesting and newsworthy memos outlining Mueller’s legal strategy for what to do if Trump pardoned Michael Flynn or tried to shut down the investigation. These documents, if verified, would rescue the book, because they offer the first real glimpse inside the nearly airtight Mueller operation.

On Tuesday, the special counsel’s office issued a rare on-the-record statement insisting that the “documents described do not exist.”"
Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs on all Mexican goods, which have come under criticism from Republicans and business interests.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, she reiterated that the tariffs stemmed from Mexico failing to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the southern border and also blamed Congress: “We just don’t think Mexico’s done enough and Congress has done even less than that.”

Conway also insisted the tariffs do not jeopardize a proposed trade agreement between the US and Mexico, stating: “We are fully confident that USMCA could pass the House.”

Conway did not directly deny a report that the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposes the tariffs. “Ambassador Lighthizer supports the President’s agenda,” she said.

U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'May At Pm']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

Houston police Chief Art Acevedo presides over a meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association in Miami on Wednesday. (Major Cities Chiefs Association/Major Cities Chiefs Association)

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

"William Barr dishes on what Huber, Horowitz, and Durham are investigating",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-barr-dishes-on-what-huber-horowitz-and-durham-are-investigating,"Attorney General William Barr gave his clearest explanation yet of the various “investigations of the investigators” being carried out by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS’s Jan Crawford, Barr described what tasks U.S. Attorney John Durham, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber have been assigned regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the DOJ and FBI as they carried it out.

Following pressure from congressional Republicans, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in March 2018 that Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah, had been picked to review any misconduct by the DOJ and FBI. Some Republicans had been calling for a second special counsel.

Huber’s long-running inquiry has long been shrouded in mystery, but Barr revealed Horowitz and Durham have taken over most of his responsibilities.

Barr said “Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance” but that he then “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review.”

Barr said Huber “was essentially on standby” in the event that Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.” That apparently has not been necessary, as Barr said “he has not been active on this front in recent months.” Barr said Durham would now be taking over Huber’s role in handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz and Huber’s involvement with Trump-Russia matters was done.

Sessions had also asked Huber in 2017 to look into issues related to the sale of Uranium One and allegations that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been improperly involved in the process, as well as broader claims of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. Barr seemed to suggest that what evidence Huber found, if any, may soon be revealed.

""The other issues [Huber has] been working on relate to Hillary Clinton” are ""winding down and hopefully we'll be in a position to bring those to fruition,"" Barr said.

[ Also read: William Barr responds to critics of his reputation: 'Everyone dies']

In regards to the DOJ inspector general investigation, Barr said he would not describe Horowitz’s role as small, but rather as very specific. “He’s looking at a discrete area that is, you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page,"" Barr said. Page was a former Trump campaign adviser who was surveilled by the DOJ and the FBI for months beginning in October 2016.

More than a year ago, in March 2018, Horowitz announced the start of the FISA abuse investigation, saying he was doing so following requests from Sessions and Republican members of Congress. GOP lawmakers alleged the DOJ and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign and Trump's administration.

At the time, the inspector general's office said it would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” That “certain U.S. person” is Page.

The DOJ inspector general also said it would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” The “source” is Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose unverified dossier was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants against Page.

Steele has communicated in recent days that he’d be willing to cooperate with Horowitz but not with Durham.

Barr, who has said that Horowitz’s probe should be ending in May or June, called him a “superb government official” in this latest interview, but pointed out that Horowitz “has limited powers.”

“He doesn't have the power to compel testimony, he doesn't have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice,” Barr said. “His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”

That’s why Barr said he selected Durham, a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to head up DOJ’s newest inquiry. Barr was recently given broad declassification authority by Trump, and Durham will have greater investigative powers than Horowitz has at his disposal. Barr praised Durham, saying, “He has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorneys general to investigate these kinds of activities. And he's always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there's no doubt in my mind that he's going he's going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this.”

Barr defended his scrutiny of the actions of the DOJ and FBI in his CBS interview, saying, “I think it's important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country.”

“And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process? Who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done? And was everyone operating in their proper lane?” Barr asked."
Cuba “Sonic Attack” Mystery: How The State Department Botched Its Investigation,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,"['Dan Vergano', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/havana-syndrome-research-cuba-sonic-attack,"“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said one medical ethicist. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.”

The second time the American diplomat felt the attack was in her apartment kitchen, after a long day working at the US Embassy in Havana. “I felt an extreme pressure like the full, frontal top of my face was exploding off my head.” Unsteady on her feet afterward, unable to work, she was medevaced to Miami and diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. But what caused that injury, and more like it to dozens of other US diplomats and their families? That’s still unknown — and may stay that way due to the way the US State Department began the medical investigation into what happened. “Day to day, we still don’t know how to attribute it,” said the injured diplomat, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve her future chances of working overseas. For the past three years, diplomats working in Cuba have complained of an array of mysterious ailments and symptoms — dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating — that often started with reports of metallic shrieks inside their homes in Havana. Many report long-lasting, perhaps permanent effects. The “Havana syndrome” mystery has been the subject of intense, and public, scrutiny, with much of it focused on the search for some sort of weapon — ultrasound, microwaves, psychology, and even crickets have been offered as explanations. Yet despite intense political pressure, international headlines, sanctions against Cuba, and withdrawal of most US diplomats from Havana, very little still is known about the cause of the “health attacks” as then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson described them in 2017, that affected at least 40 US and Canadian personnel working in the country. The syndrome is now under investigation by the big guns in biomedicine, federal health agencies, and the US National Academies of Science. But public health experts who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the State Department dropped the ball by not opening the investigation earlier to a wider swath of medical experts outside of its immediate sphere.

“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here.”

According to interviews with public health officials and affected personnel, as well as documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via a Freedom of Information Act request that included hundreds of emails exchanged between researchers and the US Navy’s research office, much of the early research into the mystery may have been botched or biased. The initial investigation was confined to two competing sets of researchers, both eager to publish studies on their own work, and whose findings have been at odds with each other. In one case, researchers were also seeking to promote their own newly approved medical device as a diagnostic tool. And until now, the effort has lacked broader oversight by an institution capable of cross-disciplinary research. “The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said medical ethicist Sergio Litewka of the University of Miami, who has written about the political cloud of secrecy and distrust surrounding the diplomats’ injuries. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.” (BuzzFeed has filed a lawsuit with the State Department requesting its communications related to the medical research into the injuries, after the agency denied a request for them on medical privacy and ongoing investigation grounds.) The two medical teams the State Department first tasked with treating victims — one from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the other from the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine — diagnosed the diplomats with injuries centered on their own respective areas of research expertise: inner ear damage and concussions. That drew criticism from other medical experts who saw them and the State Department as embracing familiar theories while closing off other explanations, ranging from viruses to poison to mass psychology. “Medical groups do tend to see what they are used to seeing,” University of Virginia applied ethics professor Deborah Johnson told BuzzFeed News, comparing the situation to the joke about intoxicated people who look for lost keys under a streetlamp because that’s where the light is. “It’s why it is best to hear from a lot of disciplines in an investigation.” Until now only those two US medical teams have reported, inconclusively, on the injuries to 26 US diplomats (and 14 Canadian ones) that began in Havana in late 2016. The US National Academy of Sciences will begin an investigation starting in the next few weeks, consisting of three standing committees of varied specialists investigating for a year. But outside experts are worried it might be too late to crack the case, starting now one year after the last report of injuries in Havana. They also fear that the State Department and other federal agencies have hobbled the medical investigation by keeping the details closed and hidden from the outside world. “The National Academy is an excellent choice, likely to bring in sophisticated scientists with a good arm’s length from the political players,” UCLA neuroscientist Mark Cohen told BuzzFeed News. “I hope that the NAS will also take the step of bringing in experts from outside the US, as well.”

Emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications.

The State Department does not fund medical research but, after the teams from Miami and UPenn failed to reach a consensus, did ask the CDC to investigate the injuries in December 2017. The CDC has not yet published the results of its investigation, more than a year later. The NIH’s brain trauma research, now open to injured diplomats and their families, is a five-year study. “Our response continues to be guided by the medical facts,” State Department senior medical adviser Behzad Shahbazian told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “World-class brain injury specialists and other scientists” at UPenn, NIH, and CDC, he said, “continue to examine the medical data to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of injury that caused these patients’ symptoms.” But according to public records obtained by BuzzFeed News, emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications. (The UPenn team requested copies of their own emails, and then declined to comment on them to BuzzFeed News. The Miami-led team responded after it was presented with a list of incidents in the emails.) The emails show the Miami-led team discussed turning the investigation into a multiyear effort at the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and, more unusual, also looked at the research on the injured diplomats as a marketing opportunity for diagnostic goggles — a medical device that one researcher and his university had a patent application on. (Via a spokesperson, the researcher denied having a financial interest in the patent.) They also worried about “State trying to reclaim ownership” of the investigation, according to their communications, which also privately suggest some saw little chance that the cause of the illnesses that started more than two years ago in Havana would ever be found.

Miami Herald / Getty Images Workers at the US Embassy in Havana leave the building on Sept. 29, 2017, after the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all but essential personnel from the embassy because Cuba could no longer guarantee diplomats’ safety.

In November 2016, the first cases of strange noises and injuries began appearing among a handful of diplomats posted to Havana. Initial reports were of buzzing sounds inside private homes. Embassy security at first thought these were just noises meant to annoy staff, according to US Senate testimony by State Department security official Todd Brown. The erratic nature of the incidents, a few one week, and then none another, added to the confusion, but by February 2017 it was clear that around half a dozen embassy staff were ill with headaches, hearing loss, or vertigo.

From the beginning, the medical investigation into these reports was ad hoc, a side project run by the doctors tasked with diagnosing and treating the diplomats and their families. The research investigation was allowed by the State Department, but not run by it. “I literally got this call, ‘This is the State Department, we have a problem,’” University of Miami medical school otolaryngologist Michael Hoffer told a Pentagon-sponsored presentation last August. “All of these individuals had experienced a loud noise or pressure before and during the symptoms.”

Hoffer, a former Navy doctor with two decades of military experience, had experience with blast victims who sustained traumatic brain injuries during the Iraq War, even receiving funding from the NFL Foundation for his research. Since Miami was the evacuation point for the embassy, it made sense for the State Department to ask the University of Miami expert to look at what resembled head injuries. He and his colleagues examined evacuated staff members with injuries in Miami, giving them neurologic, hearing, and physical exams. He later traveled to Havana to see many more, mostly unaffected personnel. In late March 2017, embassy staff were gathered in Havana by then-ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who warned them about the incidents and said they would be evaluated if they wished. It was the first time many had heard about the injuries or the sounds. According to news reports, Canadian diplomats and their families, including children, also began reporting such ailments that month — including headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and ringing in the ears — from similar sound-linked incidents. (Fifteen Canadians, including five diplomats, sued their country in February, charging that their government “downplayed the seriousness of the situation, hoarded and concealed critical health and safety information, and gave false, misleading, and incomplete information to diplomatic staff."") And the injuries kept coming. “Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound,” the injured American diplomat told BuzzFeed News about the incident in her Havana apartment in April 2017, one month after the embassy town hall. While in her apartment kitchen, “I literally had to duck around a corner to get away from it,” she said.

“Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound.”

Her vision started to blur over the next three days, so she went to a Cuban eye doctor, who diagnosed bleeding in her retinas. “We couldn’t tell the [Cuban doctor] anything,” she said, but the State Department quickly evacuated her as soon as she alerted them about the problem. She stayed in Florida for about six weeks for treatment for her eyes, before returning to Havana “to resume life.” Shortly after her return, there was a second incident in the apartment, accompanied by a buzzing noise. She said, “A sudden force on my face was pulling it up, everywhere above the nose.” Afterward she felt unsteady while walking and had fatigue and difficulty concentrating. She was evacuated to Miami, where she was evaluated for a traumatic blast injury, in the process donning a pair of experimental diagnostic goggles that tracked her eyes to measure the severity of her vertigo, and serving as a data point in Hoffer’s research. (Essentially, the goggles claim to track how the pupils of the eyes constrict in response to seeing objects move back and forth, an involuntary response that people with even mild traumatic brain injuries find difficult.) By April, the University of Miami’s Hoffer had invited his longtime colleagues, bioengineer Carey Balaban of the University of Pittsburgh and Kurt Yankaskas, their grant officer at the US Navy’s Office of Naval Research hearing loss program, to collaborate on investigating the diplomats’ injuries. The three scientists discussed inner ear “cavitation,” damaging implosions of blood bubbles caused by focused sound waves, as an explanation. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Balaban shared a proposal for a “blood vessel” grant with Yankaskas later that same month. Still more diplomats reported injuries. On May 23, 2017, the State Department told Cuba to send two of its diplomats home from its Washington, DC, embassy, unsatisfied with the Castro government’s protests of innocence concerning the injuries. Cuba had a long history of constant surveillance aimed at US diplomats. It was also known to engage in petty harassment, such as leaving unplugged refrigerators and cigarettes in ashtrays after break-ins. It made the notion of the regime lacking any knowledge of the injuries, or responsibility for them, implausible in US eyes. In all, Hoffer’s team would see 25 diplomats or their families affected by the incidents, 10 who lived with them but were unaffected in Miami, and another 105 unaffected personnel seen separately in Havana. “There was no media attention given to what was happening in Cuba when we saw these individuals,” Hoffer said at the later Pentagon teleconference, calling the group “in a sense, pure.” On July 6, 2017, Hoffer and other medical experts met with federal officials, reportedly including top State Department medical officer Charles Rosenfarb, to discuss the still-secret injuries with the diplomats. The expert panel “came to a consensus that the initial findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-natural source,” according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That consensus was perhaps unsurprising, given the experts who were looking under the lamppost: They included neurologists and hearing specialists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, according to a State Department email asking them for travel receipts. But there were no infectious disease, toxicology, tropical medicine, or psychiatric experts listed as meeting specialists — no one who might have had a competing explanation for the injuries was present. Competing theories would, however, come into play much later. Complicating any collaboration, and the research overall, was secrecy about the injuries. This remains a problem today. BuzzFeed News asked the four scientists from Johns Hopkins who were listed as participants in the July 2017 meeting, for example, to comment on the progress of the medical investigation into the Havana injuries so far. A university media representative said that one, otolaryngologist Frank Lin of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, had signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that the rest “can’t comment” for undisclosed reasons. The July 2017 meeting also included neurosurgeon Douglas Smith of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The State Department looked to his Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair, a highly regarded center for the treatment of brain injuries near Washington, DC, where many of the injured diplomats and their families lived, for their extended treatment. “It was good care, they took very good care of us,” the injured diplomat said of UPenn. “They told me, ‘We need to fix you and make you better,’; they would treat us like anyone else who came into their center with our symptoms.” Outside, however, a storm was brewing. On Aug. 9, 2017, in answer to a question from a CBS News correspondent, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that some embassy personnel “reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,” and mentioned the expulsion of Cuban diplomats in May. Headlines quickly erupted of “hearing loss” and “brain damage” to diplomats caused by an “acoustic attack,” all suggestions that outside experts have later found questionable. Cuban state television in October 2017 blamed the noises heard by the diplomats in the incidents on cicadas or crickets, something the diplomat interviewed by BuzzFeed News scoffed at. “I’ve heard cicadas before,” she said. “It sounded different.” In September, another injured diplomat who spoke to BuzzFeed News under similar conditions of anonymity was evacuated from Havana ahead of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the island. He had heard a buzzing noise in his home and the sensation of pressure, followed by problems with vertigo. “I fell out of my chair at work,” he said. He was also evaluated at UPenn, and is back at work now in the US, although he still has trouble concentrating. “I don’t function at the level I did before,” he said, and worries about the long-term effects, especially, he said, in light of the US government’s longtime wrangling with war veterans with unexplained illness tied to Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome.

By the middle of August, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Hoffer’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Balaban was corresponding with Smith about collaborating on a study of how UPenn’s brain images of injured diplomats might explain how ultrasound beams could selectively damage a person’s inner ear from a distance.

“Your data will be very important in narrowing down plausible scenarios,” Balaban wrote in an Aug. 20, 2017, email to Smith. Smith was dubious, asking how ultrasound “can go through air and [a] possible glass pane, then the skull, to selectively affect the brain.” Competition to publish research results first is the lifeblood of US scientific process. But for Havana syndrome, this drive pitted the two medical teams against each other in a race to publish in the world’s two most prestigious medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The fastest team, from UPenn, would submit a paper to a journal within a few weeks of looking at the last diplomats in their study. By November 2017, Hoffer and Balaban were drafting a paper on the diplomats that they had seen, which they planned to submit to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales by Pittsburgh-based Neuro Kinetics Inc. of the diagnostic goggles that Hoffer used to assess the diplomats’ injuries. Along with his university, Balaban had applied for a patent on the goggles with Neuro Kinetics. They shared the news with Yankaskas, their US Navy ONR grant officer:

BuzzFeed News

“It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or similar inner ear concussion,” said a December 2017 update of the draft paper, obtained via FOIA request. It compiled symptoms that ranged from ringing ears to foggy thinking to dizziness, all signs of inner ear damage, to come to this conclusion. Such symptoms were hallmarks of the blast damage to the head that the medical team had seen and diagnosed during the Iraq War. Those investigations, too, were not without controversy. The Defense Department’s inspector general in 2011 released a report critical of research that Hoffer and Balaban had conducted on US soldiers at Camp Al Taqaddum, Iraq, who were injured by explosions from 2008 to 2009. “Neurological assessments did not adhere to clinical practice guidelines” for mild traumatic brain injury, the report found. It also said that a “potential financial conflict of interest” in the experimental antioxidant tablets was not revealed to the injured personnel in the study, a research ethics violation. (Hoffer held patents on a method of administering the tablets.) A US Navy representative told Time, “The evidence suggests that no physical harm was caused by the administration of the investigational drug,” after the report came out. To close out 2017, the State Department asked the NIH to investigate the diplomats’ injuries — a move the top Republican and Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called for on Dec. 5 — with staff members quoted as critical of the medical investigation.

In January 2018, the journal JAMA notified Balaban and Hoffer that the UPenn doctors had submitted their paper and added them as coauthors. The notice led to an angry face-off between Smith and Balaban, who wanted to see the data and delay publication of the JAMA paper. He told Smith he had complained to ethics officials at the University of Pittsburgh, which posed the threat of a scientific misconduct investigation. (University of Pittsburgh’s communications office did not respond when asked if there had been an outcome of that complaint.)



BuzzFeed News “In or out” email from Smith to Balaban, Feb. 9, 2018.

JAMA released the UPenn study online less than a week after Smith told Balaban he was either “in or out,” without him or Hoffer as authors. The study of 21 people, 11 women and 10 men, concluded “they had sustained injury to widespread brain networks,” a constellation of symptoms similar to concussions caused by physical impacts. “Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened,” UPenn’s Randel Swanson, the lead author on the study, then told BuzzFeed News.

Other experts weren’t so certain. Neuroimaging expert Arthur Toga of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California told BuzzFeed News the study was “inconclusive,” noting its MRI results didn’t indicate anything grossly wrong with the diplomats’ brains that corresponded to their symptoms. Neuroscientist Sergio Della Sala of the University of Edinburgh said that the study’s standard for brain damage, seen in only two or three patients, was so loose as to describe roughly 40% of the general population as having brain damage.

“Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened.”

The JAMA study authors noted that privacy and secrecy restrictions precluded the release of some of the data about the injured diplomats, noting that only Smith and Swanson were responsible for the data. Nonetheless, they ruled out a viral cause of the injuries, because no one had reported a fever, and called poisoning unlikely to have worked so quickly after the sounds heard by 18 of the 21 patients, some of them on the island for less than 24 hours before reporting symptoms. It also ruled out a mass psychology or “functional” disorders, triggered by everything from whiplash to migraines, because the diplomats wanted to return to work and didn’t show signs of “malingering.” This last conclusion is at odds with how “psychogenic” injuries actually work — people suffer physically from injuries triggered by stress in such cases, often with symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and the others reported in some of the Havana cases. They do not fake injury to get time off work. Despite the presence of neuropsychologists on the UPenn team, the description called into question how well the JAMA study authors had really investigated the possibility of psychology to explain the injuries, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew, coauthor of Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. Four days after the study appeared in JAMA, the State Department’s Rosenfarb gave Balaban and his colleagues authorization to publish their own paper in submission with the New England Journal of Medicine. “My apology for the delay,” said Rosenfarb. They had lost the high-prestige publication race, and the delay hadn’t helped, according to an April 2018 email from Balaban. “An NEJM editor has asked us for rights of a first look before the JAMA paper was published. Our release occurred after the JAMA on-line edition appeared,” he wrote to a University of Pittsburgh publicist planning a news conference with the University of Miami’s medical school on publication of their paper, now under consideration by the journal Frontiers in Neurology. Plans for the press conference included a presentation of the Neuro Kinetics goggles that the paper described as able to uniquely diagnose people with the Havana injuries, as well as setting up advance interviews with the Miami Herald and the New York Times. A draft of the paper in review with Frontiers lists no financial conflicts of interest in the study.

BuzzFeed News A University of Pittsburgh email from Balaban, April 17, 2018.

That seems troublesome to neurologist Mitchell Joseph Valdés-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center, a leader on a Cuban panel that concluded in 2017 that the injuries were likely caused by mass hysteria. “There could be a conflict of interest, and that could have [led] to confirmation bias,” he told BuzzFeed News by email. “Their hypothesis could have been that they were going to find evidence of vestibular [inner ear] damage, which is what the [Neuro Kinetics] helmet measures.”

In response to this concern, University of Pittsburgh media relations director Joe Miksch told BuzzFeed News by email, “Balaban has not and will not receive any financial benefit from Neuro Kinetics or the sales of the Neuro Kinetics diagnostic goggles, even if the patent is granted.” He did not answer whether Balaban’s employer, the university, which owns intellectual property on the patent and can license the invention, would financially benefit from the goggles. The university has not entered into any license with Neuro Kinetics, according to Miksch. The last report of a US diplomat injured in Havana came one year ago, in May 2018. Cuba’s foreign ministry said the US State Department had informed it that a woman had “reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her place of residence.” That same month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported that two US diplomats in China reported the same sort of illness “entirely consistent” with the past Cuban cases, prompting the State Department to launch a task force with the Health and Human Services and Energy departments to investigate. (Eventually 15 US diplomats from China would be investigated for such incidents, with the Associated Press later reporting that 14 of them were ruled out from suffering the syndrome, with the 15th inconclusive.) In August, a series of letters critical of the JAMA study were published in that journal, written by a mixture of neurologists critical of the brain damage claims, and experts in “functional” disorders triggered by stress who blasted its dismissal of psychology as an explanation.

“Research with this patient cohort was not originally anticipated due to secrecy and privacy concerns,” Smith and his colleagues said in response to the letters. They restated the criteria for “neuropsychological impairment” and wrote, “we are performing advanced neuroimaging studies of the patient cohort, hoping to identify structural brain changes that may underlie the neurological manifestations.” These studies have still not been published. As mentioned, after asking to see the public records of communications released to BuzzFeed News, Smith did not reply to requests for comment. “I can only vet the (published) cognitive data, and these do not hold water,” Della Sala, the editor of the journal Cortex, told BuzzFeed News by email. “These further explanations made things even worse.” Also unpublished was the submitted Frontiers in Neurology paper by Hoffer’s team. The next appearance of their results instead came in August in talks at a “SOFWERX” Defense Department think tank in Tampa, where Hoffer discussed the injuries suffered by the diplomats. Balaban described the “Frey effect” in his talk, the production of clicking noises in the ears by exposure to microwaves, a phenomenon researched in the 1970s. “So, the ability of radiofrequency to affect the nervous system is real,” he said.

Balaban also touted the Neuro Kinetics goggles at the talk, claiming a 90% ability to tell Havana subjects apart from either blast victims or healthy people. “This is a fieldable technology,” he said.

“The promotion of the silly goggles is a shameless attempt at commercial promotion,” said Cohen, the UCLA neuroscientist. Little more than a week after Hoffer’s Tampa appearance, the New York Times published a story citing the Frey effect and suggesting that microwaves were the prime suspects as the technology that hurt the diplomats, with an endorsement of the idea from UPenn’s Smith. This caused some suspicion on both Hoffer’s and Balaban’s part that their August presentation had been eavesdropped upon and their ideas pilfered (in reality, a University of California, San Diego, news release had touted the idea a few days ahead of the story).

BuzzFeed News Email from Hoffer, Sept. 2, 2018.

“I think State trying to reclaim ownership [is] a strong possibility because we noted that the Penn group (which is a group entirely composed of clinicians) now is convince[d] this is microwaves,” Hoffer wrote in a Sept. 2 note to Balaban and Georgetown University neuroethicist James Giordano, another colleague. “Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.” The group discussed arguing for the Office of Naval Research, instead of the State Department, to lead an investigation into a “multi-layer” plethora of various kinds of energy beams causing the Havana injuries. They also discussed dropping a “red herring” as part of a “misinformation” campaign at their next talk, scheduled for later that week at a Pentagon-sponsored teleconference.

(As mentioned, BuzzFeed News has filed a lawsuit with the State Department for public records of Hoffer’s communications on his research.) “There was no misinformation campaign,” Hoffer told BuzzFeed News by email. The “red herring” was a symptom to distinguish real Havana syndrome patients from pretenders, he said. “Indeed, we have seen patients who present themselves as such.”

“Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.”

When asked about the context of the email suggesting the State Department was trying to reclaim ownership, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine media relations director Joanna Palmer replied, by email, “Dr. Hoffer has no further comment.” Meanwhile, outside experts threw cold water on microwaves, calling the Frey effect wildly implausible as an explanation for the injuries, since its inner ear clicking noises it caused were far too weak to damage tissues. “Maybe Fidel Castro is subjecting them to an ESP attack from beyond the grave,” said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster to BuzzFeed News, when shown the discussion of the “multi-layered” radiation attack idea. Foster, who has no affiliation with UPenn’s medical school team, first described the mechanism behind the clicking effect in 1974, but is dubious it is in play in Cuba. “Unless there is some independent evidence for an exposure of some kind, one could speculate endlessly.” Nevertheless, the Pentagon teleconference received press coverage, noting Balaban’s theory of some confluence of radiation and ultrasound perhaps triggering targeted cavitation in the inner ears of the injured diplomats. “I do not believe that we are close to claiming victory. In fact, I doubt that we can identify ‘the source’ for Cuba,” Balaban wrote to ONR’s Yankaskas in the aftermath of the news coverage. In the outside world, skepticism abounded about both mystery noise-making secret weapons and the diagnoses of the research teams. On Oct. 8, 2018, a neuroscience reporter from another news outlet contacted Yankaskas at ONR, for example, asking whether they could discuss “wildly implausible” ideas that Balaban had presented, and questioned whether he had a “proprietary interest” in the diagnostic goggles. Yankaskas forwarded the interview request to Balaban the same day, writing: “He’s the same reporter that I mentioned this morning.”

Robert Mueller’s public statement left most with the impression that the president would have been indicted but for the legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. This is enshrined in a Justice Department policy that Mr. Mueller had to follow. But this policy is not based on any provision of the Constitution, any law passed by Congress or any court decision.

The policy flies in the face of the principle that no man is above the law in this country, including the president. That is not just a concept. It is the basis of numerous court decisions such as United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones. No case has decided otherwise.

It is time that the policy that handcuffed Mr. Mueller be revisited and abandoned, or tested in court. Otherwise the only consequence for a criminal president is the impeachment process, which is unlikely today with a Senate controlled by the president’s own party.

I believe that Robert Mueller is wrong in stating that he is precluded by law from offering an opinion on whether President Trump’s acts warrant indictment. He relies on Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinions."
US 10-year yield collapses to 2.13% as Trump's surprise Mexico tariffs stoke recession worries,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/us-bonds-fresh-trade-tensions-and-recession-fears.html,"U.S. government debt yields added to steep May declines on Friday after President Donald Trump's new tariff threats on all Mexican imports took investors by surprise and aggravated an already-stressed U.S. trade outlook.

At 4:07 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was lower at around 2.135%, off a fresh 20-month low around 2.125% hit earlier in the session. A portion of the yield curve remained inverted as the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill held at 2.351%. The 2-year rate dropped 13 basis points to 1.926%, it's lowest level since January 2018.

The 10-year German bund yield hit a low of -0.213%, its lowest level ever back through records that began in 1988.

The flight to safety on Friday came after Trump said the night before that he will impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if Mexico didn't take unspecified steps to shore up the border, potentially undermining the recently negotiated deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

""While the essential ingredient to the overnight rally is unquestionably the President's threat of tariffs on Mexican goods unless illegal immigration is stopped, the broader backdrop is equally as supportive for Treasuries,"" Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in an email.

""The ongoing policy quandary of 'what will it take to get the Fed to cut?' has been complicated by the gradual nature of the stock selloff which has kept equity volatility, and therefore the tightening in financial conditions, relatively tame,"" he added. ""Nonetheless, financial conditions are at the tightest level seen since January and the pace of the move is comparable to December.""

Trump's Mexico tariffs also represent the White House's latest attempt to pressure an economic partner through the use of trade levies, a tactic Trump has relied on throughout his negotiations with China. The administration imposed 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports earlier this month following a breakdown in talks between Beijing and Washington.

The stall in U.S.-China talks triggered — in addition to the more expensive imports — a paradigm shift in Wall Street's upbeat markets and economic outlook. Traders who had been betting on a lukewarm to positive resolution with China punished risk assets like equities in favor of safer assets like U.S. Treasurys, sending the prices of debt higher and yields lower.

The S&P 500 — down 6.5% this month — tracked a 34-basis-point drop in the 10-year Treasury rate, which in turn inverted a portion of the yield curve. Such inversions are often seen as a recession indicator as those who buy debt from the U.S. government for years are compensated with poorer rates than those who loan money for a matter of months.

The difference between the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at -21.8 basis points. The spread between the 10-year yield and the 2-year yield remained at a positive, albeit flattish 21 basis points.

But while market focus on Friday centered on Trump's latest tariffs, other bond strategists noted what the larger change in outlook could mean for the Federal Reserve. A growing number of investors now expect the Fed to cut its overnight lending rate later in 2019 as the boost from Trump's tax cuts gives way to mounting trade disputes and weaker economic data overall.

""At the beginning of the year, I said that the 10 year was heading to a 2.25% yield, in my opinion, and maybe even through that. I now believe we are heading to a 2.00% yield for the 10 year Treasury,"" Mark Grant, chief global strategist of fixed income at B. Riley FBR said in an email.

Chair Jerome Powell said in March 2018 that ""there's no thought that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook,"" has in recent months tweaked his rhetoric, especially around Europe and China. Twelve months following those first comments on the Trump administration's trade tactics, Powell said that the weaker overseas outlook is dampening domestic growth estimates.

""Much discussion is made of this suggesting a Recession is forthcoming but that is not my take,"" Grant added. ""The Fed, for its own portfolio, has not bought Treasury Bills, a policy that I think will be reversed, and then the Yield Curve will begin to normalize as the Fed's assets include the shorter end of the Curve."""

Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."
President Donald Trump Announces 5% Tariff On All Goods From Mexico,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-31/president-donald-trump-announces-5-tariff-on-all-goods-from-mexico,"President Donald Trump said he would carry out his plan under the authority granted to him by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

President Donald Trump announced that the United States will impose a 5% tariff next month on all goods coming from Mexico.

The president tweeted Thursday that the tariff will begin June 10 and remain in place until ""illegal immigrants coming through Mexico and into our country stop,"" and the tariff will gradually increase ""until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.""

Trump said he would carry out his plan under the authority granted to him by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

A statement from the White House said the tariff is a response to the ""emergency"" at the U.S.-Mexico border. If the issue is not alleviated through ""effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment,"" the tariff on all goods will increase to 10% July 1 and continue to increase by 5% each month until it reaches 25% on Oct. 1.

At that time, the tariff will permanently remain at 25%.

The statement claims that the high tariff will cause companies in Mexico to move back to the U.S. to make their products. Companies that return to America will not be subject to the tariff.

""Should Mexico choose not to cooperate on reducing unlawful migration, the sustained imposition of tariffs will produce a massive return of jobs back to American cities and towns,"" the statement said. ""Remember, our great country has been the 'piggy bank' from which everybody wants only to take. The difference is that now we are firmly and forcefully standing up for America's interests.""

Following Trump's announcement, U.S. stock futures and global stock markets , including shares of Asian and European automakers, fell Friday. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.63%, Britain's FTSE 100 dipped 1% and Germany's DAX slipped 1.78%.

""We have confidence that Mexico can and will act swiftly to help the United States stop this long-term, dangerous and deeply unfair problem,"" the statement said. ""The United States has been very good to Mexico for many years. We are now asking that Mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country.""

"Sterigenics created cancer risk 10 times higher than federal EPA standards in Willowbrook, new report says",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-epa-cancer-risks-20190529-story.html,"Ethylene oxide emitted by Sterigenics continued to pose high cancer risks after the company installed new pollution-control equipment last summer, according to a new federal study based in part on months of air quality testing in Willowbrook and nearby west suburban communities.

Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday that toxic pollution from the company’s Willowbrook sterilization plant was responsible for long-term cancer risks up to 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

Cancer risks remained high in the area despite improvements Sterigenics voluntarily undertook to prevent all but one-tenth of 1% of the ethylene oxide it used from escaping into surrounding neighborhoods.

“Based on current science, there are very high levels of risk,” said William Wehrum, the Trump administration’s top air official, who told sometimes angry residents at a public meeting in Burr Ridge that he takes their concerns “very, very seriously.”

Responding to questions, EPA officials said pollution from Sterigenics increased the risk of developing cancer for people living as far as 25 miles away from Willowbrook. The biggest risks were in six suburbs — Willowbrook, Darien, Burr Ridge, Hinsdale, Indian Head Park and Western Springs — and declined steadily the farther away a neighborhood was from the facility, according to a map the EPA posted online and statements from agency officials during the meeting.

Wehrum and other EPA officials suggested the company could take more aggressive steps that would allow its now-shuttered facility to safely resume operations. But bipartisan state legislation sent Thursday to Gov. J.B. Pritzker would ban Sterigenics from reopening unless medical equipment suppliers — the company’s main clients — certify their products can only be sterilized with ethylene oxide.

The new EPA report comes as the federal agency is pledging to adopt more stringent restrictions on sterilization facilities nationwide, a rare departure from attempts by Wehrum and other Trump appointees to block, delay or undermine environment and public health regulations.

Willowbrook is a focal point in the ongoing debate, largely because EPA scientists determined last year that neighborhoods near Sterigenics are among just a few dozen throughout the U.S. where breathing toxic chemicals is responsible for more than 1 case of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetime.

Like in the Willowbrook area, ethylene oxide is the main chemical of concern in nearly all of those other areas. The volatile gas has been on the federal list of carcinogens since 1985, and in 2016 the EPA released a long-delayed reassessment linking it more conclusively to breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas at extremely low levels of exposure.

Several residents at the Wednesday meeting said they don’t trust the EPA or Sterigenics to protect them. Agency officials, they noted, acknowledged that local cancer risks likely were significantly higher in the past when the Willowbrook facility emitted up to 169,000 pounds of ethylene oxide a year.

“The only appropriate resolution … is for Sterigenics to permanently shut down,” said Margie Donnell, a member of the Stop Sterigenics community group.

More than 19,000 people live within a mile of the Willowbrook facility. Four schools and a day care center also are close by, including Hinsdale South High School in Darien and Gower Middle School in Burr Ridge.

Laws and regulations don’t allow the EPA to force Sterigenics to close for good, Wehrum said, but the agency can take action to ensure cancer risks posed by the company’s pollution are within federal guidelines.

Wednesday’s meeting was the third public forum organized by federal and state officials since the EPA released its latest National Air Toxics Assessment in late August.

A Chicago Tribune analysis of agency data revealed that of 73,057 census tracts in the United States, seven tracts near Sterigenics are among just 109 nationwide with long-term cancer risks exceeding the agency’s guidelines. The findings prompted months of intense pressure from elected officials and the public, forcing the EPA to pay closer attention to a once-obscure industry.

“It is not lost upon us, and it certainly isn’t lost upon me, the depth to which this has affected you,” John Kim, acting director of the Illinois EPA, told residents. “We are doing everything we can to bring you relief.”

After months of meetings with Wehrum and his staff, Sterigenics is vowing to overhaul its facility again, even as the company contends that other sources of ethylene oxide were responsible for spikes of the toxic gas recorded by monitoring equipment deployed near its facility between November and March."
DHS awards $276M contract for CDM dashboard,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/continuous-diagnostics-mitigation-cdm-dashboard-ecs-federal/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Department of Homeland Security has awarded ECS Federal a $276 million contract to provide a governmentwide dashboard for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.

The Fairfax, Virginia, company will receive $7.7 million in the base year of the potential six-year contract, according to data on the Federal Procurement Data System. DHS’s goal is to improve how security information about federal networks is visualized for IT personnel in agencies across the government.

The General Services Administration’s FEDSIM office issued the contract on behalf of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), formerly the National Protection and Programs Directorate.

The dashboard “will provide a total integrated technology solution for the CDM Federal and Agency dashboards, and will provide DHS with an integrated Dashboard solution for continuous monitoring and mitigation of cyber threats and vulnerabilities to the Federal .gov environment by expanding and enhancing the current instance of the Federal Dashboard through a suite of integrated hardware and software tools resulting in a ‘CDM Dashboard Ecosystem,'” a CISA official told FedScoop via email. “The enhancement of the CDM Dashboard through this [task order] will provide Federal agencies with a user-friendly and intuitive solution that can be utilized to visualize and prioritize risks and vulnerabilities in an Agency’s cybersecurity posture.”

The overall purpose, the official said, is to “provide actionable information to allow agencies to ‘fix the worst problems first'” across their networks.

CDM Program Manager Kevin Cox recently described the next steps for the program now that the initial contracts have been awarded and basic tool sets are available.

“It’s a question of: Will the CDM program become this wider sense of getting full cybersecurity solutions in place across all these different capability areas, or will we be more targeted on high-value assets, specific environments, etc.?” Cox said.

Cox also explained how the dashboard will open agencies up to new tools, analytics and business intelligence.

“If one agency has an incident, there’s a greater likelihood that spreads and gets to other agencies or that it’s happening at the same time across many agencies,” he said. “So we wanted to get that visibility.”"

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

Democratic senator threatens to block Treasury nominees over info on Trump's tax returns,https://thehill.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/446187-senate-dem-threatens-to-block-treasury-nominees-for-answers-on-trumps-tax,"The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday threatened to block nominees to the Treasury Department until the Trump administration answers questions about the handling of a Democratic request for the president’s tax returns.

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” Wyden said.

“Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Senators occasionally place holds on nominees who they find highly problematic, or to extract concessions. A hold prevents the Senate from quickly confirming the nominee.

Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel overseeing Treasury, is seeking information from the department on Mnuchin's decision to decline a House Democratic request for Trump’s tax returns.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealTrump antagonizes both parties on trade SECURE Act will give Main Street workers needed security White House starts clock on approval for new NAFTA MORE (D-Mass.) on April 3 requested six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns from the IRS. After a series of delays, Mnuchin told Neal in a May 6 letter that he would not comply with the request after consulting with the Department of Justice.

Neal then sent subpoenas for the returns to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, which are likely to spawn a lengthy court battle.

In a May 14 letter, Wyden asked Mnuchin for copies of emails, memorandums and other communications detailing how Mnuchin came to his decision.

Wyden also asked Mnuchin for information on how the IRS handled previous congressional requests for tax returns, under section 6103(f) of the tax code, the same provision Neal cited in his request for Trump’s returns. That section states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" tax returns requested by the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means committees.

In a Wednesday letter to Wyden, the Treasury Department only handed over copies of Mnuchin’s previous correspondence to Neal and a report on requests for returns under 6103 in 2018.

Wyden called the reply “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”"
