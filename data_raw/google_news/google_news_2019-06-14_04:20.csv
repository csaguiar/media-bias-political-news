"Sarah Sanders, one of the last original top Trump aides, leaving White House",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Kathryn Watson', 'Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.', 'Fin Gomez']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sarah-sanders-leaving-press-secretary-stepping-down-white-house-president-trump-says-today-2019-06-13/,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is leaving the White House, marking another high-level departure of one of the few remaining aides to President Trump. Sanders told reporters she won't rule out a run for governor in Arkansas.

It isn't immediately clear who will replace her. The president first announced Sanders' impending departure in a tweet.

""After 3 1/2 years, our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the Great State of Arkansas,"" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday afternoon. ""She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas - she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done!""

""I am blessed and forever grateful to @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to serve and proud of everything he's accomplished,"" Sanders followed up in a tweet. ""I love the President and my job. The most important job I'll ever have is being a mom to my kids and it's time for us to go home. Thank you Mr. President!""

Mr. Trump again encouraged Sanders to run for governor in a prison reform event in the White House East Room Thursday afternoon: ""I'm trying to get her to do that.""

Sanders, called on stage during the event Thursday afternoon, said the chance to serve the president and the country was the ""opportunity of a lifetime."" She pledged to continue to promote and defend the president's agenda from outside of government.

""I'll try not to get emotional because I know that crying can make us look weak sometimes right?"" Sanders said, looking at the president and smiling. ""This has been the honor of a lifetime, the opportunity of a lifetime. I couldn't be prouder to have had the opportunity to serve my country and particularly to work for this president. He has accomplished so much in these two and a half years and it's truly been something I will treasure forever.

""It's one of the greatest jobs I could ever have, I've loved every minute. Even the hard minutes, I have loved it,"" she added.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders reflects on her time as White House press secretary

Many White House staffers found out Sanders would depart during a 3 p.m. meeting.

Sanders, the daughter of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, has served in the White House since the beginning of Mr. Trump's presidency, taking over for Sean Spicer when he left that role.

CBS News reported exactly a year ago that Sanders had been telling friends she intended to leave the administration at the end of the year, but that timeline was extended. Sources close to Sanders told CBS News she was planning on leaving last year, but decided against that after her then-principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah decided to leave the administration. Sources close to Sanders also said she would consider a political career in Arkansas, but not for a while. She wants to spent time with her family and three young children.

Sanders, sources close to her said, represented a strong fabric, even when internal factions consumed the White House in the early days of the administration.

White House press briefings became less and less frequent occasions under Sanders. The last White House briefing was more than 90 days ago.

It's unclear if briefings would become more frequent under anyone who might replace her.

The job of White House press secretary is challenging under any presidency — but arguably, particularly under Mr. Trump, who oftentimes contradicts his own staff on Twitter or in gaggles with reporters. Shah, the former principal deputy press secretary who worked with Sanders, praised her tenure.

""She did an incredible job defending the president with an often hostile press corps. And everybody who worked with her found her to be incredibly humble and she was an incredible friend, and mentor to me. She was the best boss I ever had,"" Shah said."
Jim Hanson: Iran’s aggression may force Trump to launch military attack,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jim Hanson', 'Jim Hanson Is President Of Security Studies Group', 'Served In Us Army Special Forces.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jim-hanson-irans-aggression-may-force-trump-to-attack,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was right to call the world’s attention Thursday to Iran’s unprovoked attack on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier in the day. Pompeo said the U.S. holds Iran responsible for this dangerous aggression – a clear warning to the mullahs who rule the Islamic Republic that the U.S. will ensure they face consequences.

It would be irresponsible for the Trump administration to turn a blind eye to what Pompeo called Iran’s “blatant assault.”

Unfortunately, bad behavior by Iran is nothing new. Iran and its proxies have been attacking targets in the Gulf region for a month now. The U.S. has thus far not retaliated, but that time may soon be upon us. Quite understandably, the patience of the Trump administration is quickly running out.

IRAN RESPONSIBLE FOR ‘BLATANT ASSAULT’ ON OIIL TANKERS IN GULF OF OMAN, MIKE POMPEO SAYS

The latest Iranian targets were an airport in Saudi Arabia where 26 people were wounded, along with the two tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

Speaking to reporters to explain how the U.S. knows Iran is responsible for the attacks, Pompeo said: “This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.”

A senior government official advised me that the identification of Iran as the culprit ""was just the first step and there would be more to follow.""

Iran’s offensive started soon after the nation’s rulers said they would disrupt the flow of oil flow through the Straits of Hormuz, as four tankers were being attacked while anchored near the United Arab Emirates.

There was little doubt then that Iran was responsible for the attack, but opinions varied as to what U.S. response was warranted. The stakes were raised when Iranian proxies – Houthi rebels in Yemen – hit an oil pipeline with a drone attack a day later.

This first wave of assaults did not trigger a military retaliation from the U.S., based partly on a desire from allies in the region to avoid an escalation.

There is a saying that “rubble don’t make no trouble.” Since the U.S. has made good-faith efforts to deal with Iranian attacks via nonviolent means, it may be a good time to turn some of Iran’s military equipment into smoking wreckage.

But now we have a second wave of Iranian attacks. The U.S. reluctance seems to be nearing an end, because Iran has raised the stakes and has shown no self-control.

It seems that the Iranian regime either feels the U.S. will not take military action, or wants to see how far it can go before provoking an American response.

Either way, the Iranians are asking for trouble.

President Trump has been making a concerted effort to get Iran into negotiations for a new nuclear deal. The maximum pressure sanctions campaign that Trump has ordered on Iran was designed specifically for that purpose and is having a crippling impact on the Iranian economy.

Iran’s leaders would be wise to take President Trump seriously. They won’t be able to take the U.S. to the cleaners as they did when President Barack Obama was in office.

Obama made concession after concession – including ignoring Iran’s regional aggression – in a desperate attempt to get deal delaying Iran’s ability to acquire nuclear weapons. But the deal did nothing to curb Iran’s dangerous military activities, including its support of terrorists, threats to Israel and other bad behavior.

President Trump wisely pulled out of the deeply flawed nuclear deal, which gave Iran far too much in return for far too little.

Obama’s nuclear deal would – at best – have slowed Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions for a few years, simply kicking the problem of Iranian nukes down the road for another president to deal with.

President Trump doesn’t want to enter the political campaign season with a potential or actual war with Iran underway – but he is too responsible to want to simply hand off problems to his successors.

If the Iranians think Trump will hesitate to do what needs to be done to keep the U.S. and our allies safe and to keep vital oil shipping lanes open, they are making a dangerous miscalculation.

Assuming there is sufficient proof of Iran’s complicity in any of the recent attacks, it is time for the U.S. to show the Iranians they are in danger of being forced to pay a price far higher than economic sanctions for their continued military adventurism.

Some potential ways to send a message the Iranians will understand could include a U.S. cruise missile strike on an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps naval base that houses some of the fast attack boats Iran uses to harass and attack foreign ships.

It would also be a good idea for the U.S. to conduct a joint strike with Saudi Arabia on a Houthi rebel base in Yemen. This would serve a dual purpose.

First, a joint strike would back up our warning that we would not differentiate between attacks by Iran and its proxies. Iran is responsible for both. Second, such a strike would support the Saudi and UAE fight against Iranian efforts to cement a foothold in Yemen that menaces much of the world’s oil flow.

At this point, it is more dangerous for America to fail to respond to Iran. Passivity would signal Iran’s rulers that they are not constrained from shutting down the two main sea lanes for shipping Middle East oil.

President Trump would be at a significant disadvantage in any attempt to limit Iranian aggression, let alone start a negotiation, if the Iranians conclude they can act recklessly and suffer no consequences.

There is a saying that “rubble don’t make no trouble.” Since the U.S. has made good-faith efforts to deal with Iranian attacks via nonviolent means, it may be a good time to turn some of Iran’s military equipment into smoking wreckage. This could be the wakeup call Iran needs to hear to curb its dangerous behavior.

Trump smashed months of FBI work to thwart election interference,https://www.politico.com,"['Darren Samuelsohn', 'Natasha Bertrand', 'Andrew Restuccia', 'Jack Shafer']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/fbi-election-interference-fight-donald-trump-1364597,"The president's comments have placed FBI Director Christopher Wray in a position where he might have to either publicly chastise the president and risk getting fired, or resign in protest. | Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call elections Trump smashed months of FBI work to thwart election interference Trump's willingness to accept foreign assistance has essentially invited overseas spies to meddle with 2020 presidential campaigns, undoing months of work, said law enforcement veterans.

Nearly two years ago, FBI Director Chris Wray set up an office tasked solely with stopping the type of Russian interference efforts that infected the 2016 campaign.

On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump undercut the whole operation in a matter of seconds.

Story Continued Below

In an ABC News interview, the president first proclaimed he would have no problem accepting dirt on his opponents from a foreign power, then said Wray was “wrong” to suggest the FBI needs to know about such offers.

The comments, according to interviews with nearly a dozen law enforcement veterans, have undone months of work, essentially inviting foreign spies to meddle with 2020 presidential campaigns and demoralizing the agents trying to stop them. And it has backed Wray into a corner, they added, putting him in a position where he might have to either publicly chastise the president and risk getting fired, or resign in protest.

America’s enemies will see Trump’s comments and likely “come out of the woodwork like never before to try to influence the president,” said longtime FBI veteran Frank Figliuzzi, who served as the bureau’s assistant director for counterintelligence until 2012. “And it’s going to be more difficult to defend against because they’ll try harder than ever to mask their attempts.”

Trump has broken all manner of traditional protocol during his presidency when it comes to law enforcement and the intelligence community. His calls early in his administration to launch investigations into his political opponents were widely panned by Justice Department veterans who deemed the Oval Office requests as out of line. But more recently, Trump has found an ally in William Barr, the new attorney general who has taken the president up on his demand for a wider examination into the origins of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

With Trump’s latest comments, aired Wednesday night, the president has resurrected a question that special counsel Robert Mueller spent nearly two years investigating — is it collusion to accept damaging information on an opponent from foreign agents attempting to interfere in a U.S. election?

“It’s not an interference,” Trump told the anchor George Stephanopoulos, a former Bill Clinton White House communications director. “They have information, I think I’d take it.”

Trump described such offers as “opposition research” and said he’d call the FBI only “if I thought there was something wrong.”

Some linked Trump’s remarks to Mueller’s deliberation over whether his team could have charged anyone on the Trump campaign if they had obtained the promised hurtful information on Hillary Clinton from a Kremlin intermediate during a much-scrutinized Trump Tower meeting. Mueller’s report said he wasn’t sure the potential information had financial value, meaning it might not qualify as an illegal campaign contribution from a foreign entity. The report also raised questions about whether there was a free-speech right to receive the information.

“It’s turning the First Amendment into a suicide pact that allows our own government to be undermined,” said Rick Hasen, a professor at the University of California Irvine’s law school, who called the special counsel’s findings “a green light for foreign intervention in the 2020 election, and that was affirmed by what Trump said to ABC.”

Current and former Trump officials downplayed the president’s remarks as Trump being Trump. While the comments drive Democrats mad and consume the media, they matter to rank-and-file government workers only if they actually come come with direct orders, they argued.

“I think people take it in stride until he tries to operationalize it,” said a former Trump White House official.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/e2/d5/31b889b2444598a776f522c7da43/190613-trump-abcnews-campos.png"" true

Spokespersons at both the DOJ and FBI declined to comment on the president’s remarks.

Just three months after Wray assumed the top FBI post in August 2017, he told Congress that he had set up a “foreign influence” task force to stymie future election meddling efforts.

The team brings together counterintelligence, cyber and counterterrorism officials — nearly 40 in total, according to a New York Times story — and coordinates with all 56 FBI field offices. It also works with the Homeland Security Department, state and local governments, as well as the major social media companies that Russian agents used to spread disinformation and stage fake rallies meant to incite voter anger.

The breadth of the effort has to match the scale of the problem, Wray said at a White House briefing last August. “Make no mistake — the scope of this foreign influence threat is both broad and deep,” he said.

Wray also took his warnings to Capitol Hill last month, telling lawmakers that campaigns must be on the lookout for suspicious outreach efforts.

“I think my view is that if any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any nation state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation state about influencing or interfering with our election, then that’s something that the FBI would want to know about,” Wray said.

The FBI’s work in recent years to combat foreign election interference has received consistent praise from lawmakers of all political leanings, as well as numerous Trump administration officials.

Barr called the task force a “very dynamic program” during a Senate hearing in May on Mueller’s final report, adding, “I'm very impressed with what they’re up to.” Vice President Mike Pence gave the efforts a shoutout at a cybersecurity conference in New York in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm election.

But law enforcement specialists said Trump has now made this work harder.

Frank Montoya, Jr., a former director of an FBI counterintelligence office from 2012 to 2014, said Trump’s mindset about foreign influence presents “real dangers” to U.S. national security.

“One, our adversaries will see it as an invitation to interfere in the next election on his behalf,” he said. “But worse is the open door Trump has enabled for all manner of influence operations to continue against U.S. interests.”

David Kris, a former Obama-era assistant attorney general for national security, argued that Trump’s latest comments essentially mark the second time he’s publicly asked for Russian help to win a presidential election. During the 2016 campaign, Trump memorably proclaimed that if Russia was “listening,” it should go after Clinton’s “missing” emails — a comment he later said was made in jest.

“U.S. law enforcement, intelligence and security officials will do what they can to protect the integrity of our democratic processes,” said Kris, founder of the intelligence consulting firm Culper Partners, “while being publicly contradicted and undermined by their boss.”

Other former law enforcement veterans said the president’s remarks will hurt morale inside the FBI and the other departments working on election security issues.

“I cannot tell you how profoundly troubling this is to the core of my professional experience,” said a former longtime national security official.

“It has to be demoralizing to some extent and confusing and, let’s face it, unprecedented, to have a commander in chief who has such a lack of fundamental understanding about the work the Justice Department and intelligence community do in this area,” added Greg Brower, the former top FBI liaison to Congress who served under Wray during his first months as director.

“To flat out say the FBI director is wrong on this or any other issue is, in and of itself, stunning” Brower added. “It’s tougher for the leadership, the appointees of the president, who know the president is wrong, who have to wonder about his fundamental lack of understanding about what those agencies are doing.”

Jim Baker, who served as the FBI’s general counsel under FBI Director James Comey, told POLITICO that the remarks could put Wray in a position where he might have to resign in protest if he can’t persuade the president to change his tune.

Wray needs to join Barr “to have a discussion with [Trump], and if they don’t get a sense of comfort then they’ll have some hard decisions to make,” Baker said. “I don’t think they should run for the exits right away, but they can’t just ignore this one. This is potentially encouraging criminal activity and undermining federal law.”

In the meantime, the message for the bureau’s rank and file is that everything should be business as usual, said David Laufman, a former top DOJ national security official who retired in 2018.

“Notice is certainly taken within the ranks of the FBI and the intelligence community when the president of the United States says things that, on their face, are utterly antithetical to the common mission to protect our national security,” said Laufman, who had a key role overseeing the early stages of the FBI’s Russia investigation before Mueller’s appointment.

“While off-the-cuff remarks made during an interview are not equivalent to executive orders,” he continued, “it seems to me very important for leadership at the FBI and in the intelligence community to reinforce with their agency personnel that nothing has changed in the agencies’ commitment to countering foreign influence operations.”

Employees turn their back on Agriculture secretary over being relocated to Kansas City,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/usda-employees-relocated-kansas-city-perdue/index.html,"(CNN) Employees from the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, two Department of Agriculture research agencies, stood and turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in silent protest at an all-hands meeting Thursday.

Perdue announced earlier Thursday morning that the Economic Research Service, which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which allocates federal research funding, will be relocated to Kansas City from Washington, D.C. -- the final announcement in a process that began last year.

The moment of solidarity comes after both agencies -- the Economic Research Service last month and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture just this week -- voted overwhelmingly to unionize to push back against the move, which many view as politically driven.

Perdue announced the final relocation site in a letter that was distributed to employees Thursday morning. Perdue and the department have argued that the move will lower standard of living costs, save taxpayer dollars and move the agencies closer to ""stakeholders.""

""Following a rigorous site selection process, the Kansas City Region provides a win win -- maximizing our mission function by putting taxpayer savings into programmatic outputs and providing affordability, easy commutes, and extraordinary living for our employees,"" Perdue said. ""The Kansas City Region has proven itself to be hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America's heartland."
DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."

Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeComey: Trump peddling 'dumb lies' Liz Cheney: Statements by agents investigating Trump 'could well be treason' Five takeaways from Barr's new powers in 'spying' probe MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeySchiff threatens to subpoena FBI Schiff threatens to subpoena FBI Trump campaign contacts with Moscow to be focus for Democrats MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

USDA research agencies will move to Kansas City region despite opposition,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'June At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Two scientific agencies in the Department of Agriculture will move from Washington to the greater Kansas City region, USDA announced Thursday, despite strong resistance to the plan.

Nearly 550 positions at the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science, are expected to be moved by the end of the federal fiscal year, Sept. 30. USDA estimated the savings at $300 million over 15 years from employment and rent.

“The Kansas City Region has proven itself to be hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America’s heartland,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The news release did not identify the location of the offices. But Tim Cowden, president and chief executive of the Kansas City Area Development Council, said the agency is evaluating office property on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri border.

Perdue had unveiled a plan to relocate the two agencies in August, without specifying a site. He called the decision a cost-saving measure and said it would bring them closer to their “stakeholders” in farming regions. Initially, he also proposed placing ERS under the Office of the Chief Economist but that was not part of the final plan, according to a letter the secretary sent employees on Thursday.

Scientists across the country rely on NIFA grants to study topics ranging from climate change and crop genetics to farmland drones. ERS produces statistical reports that influence decisions in corporate boardrooms and in state and federal capitals.

Republican senators representing Missouri and Kansas welcomed Thursday’s announcement. “We’re home to some of the hardest working farmers in the country, so this is a fantastic decision by the USDA,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in a statement.

NIFA and ERS workers will join nearly 5,000 other USDA employees in Kansas City, said Cowden, whose group proposed the region to USDA last year.

“We’re within 300 miles of 13 land grant universities,” said Kimberly Young, president of the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, a development council initiative. The area is an epicenter of the animal health industry, Young said, with more than 300 such companies nearby.

But current employees of the two agencies, several Democratic lawmakers and a bipartisan coalition of former USDA leaders warned that the move, more than 900 miles from Washington, would devastate the two agencies.

“This is not just a change of address,” said Jack Payne, University of Florida’s senior vice president for agriculture. “It cuts NIFA off from the collaboration with other federal funding agencies in D.C. that are its major partners.”

NIFA unionized earlier this week, and ERS unionized in May in the face of the decision. Union officials have promised to fight the move. As Perdue addressed NIFA and ERS employees in an auditorium Thursday afternoon, members of the bargaining unit stood and turned their backs to the secretary in protest.

“The announcement today should be met with great skepticism that Secretary Perdue has the best interests of either federal employees or American agriculture in mind,” said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, which represents ERS employees.

In a call with reporters Thursday afternoon, Perdue acknowledged that some employees have “expressed displeasure” with the move. “I understand that no one ever wants their cheese moved,” he said, referring to a 2000 book on business management. He suggested USDA employees who wish to remain in the District seek “other options here in federal service.”

Perdue also said the General Services Administration, the agency that manages federal real estate, will begin the process of acquiring office space around July 1.

Jeffrey Neal, a chief human resources officer in the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said if USDA began issuing notices to employees this month the department “could pull it off by the end of the fiscal year.” Neal predicted such a swift move would be expensive — USDA estimated relocation will cost $50,000 per worker — and “messy,” losing numerous employees in the process.

Gale Buchanan, USDA chief scientist under President George W. Bush, and Catherine E. Woteki, chief scientist in the Obama administration, predicted the relocation would set ERS back “five to 10 years” due to a loss of specialized employees, as they wrote in a 2018 letter to Congress signed by dozens of agricultural leaders.

“There isn’t a plan in place for how to manage this,” Woteki told The Washington Post. The offices, which together employ about 700 people when fully staffed, are roughly two-thirds the size they were during the Obama administration.

Workloads have ballooned as ERS employees have quit at double the normal rate since October, The Post reported. Acting officials have filled several vacant ERS leadership positions.

USDA lacks a chief scientist, who oversees ERS, NIFA and other USDA research offices. Trump’s first nominee, radio host Sam Clovis, withdrew from consideration over his ties to the investigation of Russia’s influence on the 2016 election. Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) placed a hold on Trump’s second nominee, former Dow Chemical executive Scott Hutchins, because the senator opposes the relocation, Van Hollen’s spokeswoman said. In January, Perdue appointed Hutchins deputy undersecretary for research, education, and economics, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

“Our overarching concern is what happens to the important scientific work that these two agencies perform at USDA on behalf of the public, on behalf of farmers and rural communities and everyone who eats,” said Karen Perry Stillerman, an analyst who specializes in food and the environment at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group that advocates for researchers.

NIFA currently rents costly offices on the Washington waterfront, and ERS leases space in the nearby Patriots Plaza. In April, Perdue announced a plan he dubbed “OneNeighborhood,” which seeks to consolidate workers into two USDA-owned buildings in the capital region. But ERS and NIFA employees slated for the move, per an April 19 memo obtained by The Post, were excluded from OneNeighborhood.

Peter Winch, an organizer for American Federation of Government Employees, said the two agencies held all-hands meetings on May 22 to discuss buyouts and severance payments. Once employees receive relocation letters, they will have 30 days to decide whether to move. USDA will offer 30 or fewer buyouts per agency, he said employees were told.

Using an internal ERS document known as the “stay-go” list, analysts at the Union of Concerned Scientists identified nearly 80 jobs scheduled to remain in Washington. The bulk belong to administrative staff, analysts who perform market outlook estimates and those who collect data. Economists and other ERS researchers who make conclusions from that data are likely to be reassigned to Kansas City, according to this analysis.

But USDA disputed that. “Of the 76 ERS positions staying in the National Capitol Region, over half of these positions perform core research functions,” USDA spokeswoman Meghan Rodgers said in an email.

Democratic lawmakers have also vowed to try to block the move. “We hope that Congress will recognize that this is legitimate executive function,” Perdue told reporters on Thursday.

A federal department must pass a “very low bar” in providing reasons for reassignments, Neal said. “The ability of Congress, with split control of the House and the Senate, to stop something like this in its tracks is questionable.""

House appropriators recently prohibited funds for the move in a 2020 appropriations bill. “It is alarming that the administration is rushing ahead with this relocation in order to circumvent Congress,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement. Hoyer vowed “to explore all options to reverse this decision.”

Senate Democrats introduced a bill to keep the agencies in the national capital region, mirroring House legislation introduced earlier this year by Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine). Van Hollen said Thursday he would offer this legislation as an amendment to the defense budget bill recently released by the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I will continue to fight this tooth and nail,” he said in a statement.

Lawmakers have also questioned whether the secretary has the authority to relocate these offices without congressional approval, prompting an investigation by the USDA’s inspector general office.

Lawmakers urge DOJ to launch criminal investigation of generic drug makers,https://www.cnn.com,['Wayne Drash'],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/health/generic-drugs-doj-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) Two top lawmakers urged the US Department of Justice on Thursday to launch a criminal investigation into the nation's generic drug manufacturers to see whether their executives conspired to raise prices at the expense of the American public.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, made the request in a letter to Attorney General William Barr and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim.

""We urge the Department of Justice to investigate whether generic drug companies and executives violated criminal antitrust laws and ask that the Department of Justice pursue enforcement if warranted,"" the lawmakers said.

The news comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed last month by a coalition of 44 states, alleging that 20 major drug manufacturers conspired to artificially inflate and manipulate the prices of more than 100 generic drugs, with the companies making billions in the process.

Cummings and Sanders said they were particularly troubled by allegations raised in the lawsuit. ""Executives at Teva Pharmaceuticals allegedly orchestrated a sophisticated scheme to collude surreptitiously with competitors, artificially inflate the prices of over a hundred generic drugs, and destroy evidence of criminal conduct,"" they wrote.

Teva, one of the largest makers of generics in the world, denied any wrongdoing and said it has been cooperating with the Department of Justice in its ongoing probe.

""As reported in our public filings for several years, there has already been an ongoing DOJ criminal and civil probe into allegations of price fixing in the generic pharmaceuticals market,"" Teva spokeswoman Kelley Dougherty said in a written statement. ""Teva has been cooperating with these investigations and vigorously denies any of the alleged wrongdoing that has been circulated in the media.""

Cummings and Sanders said it is time to hold executives accountable for their alleged actions, beyond civil court. The two lawmakers expressed outrage about allegations in the civil suit that their offices were deceived by generic drug makers during a 2014 investigation.

""It is sick and disgraceful that generic pharmaceutical executives, who should be making medicines affordable for the American people, were instead busy coordinating a cover-up scheme to hide the truth about their price-fixing conspiracy when we asked about their skyrocketing prices,"" Sanders said in a statement.

Sanders cited an unredacted email uncovered as part of the civil suit in which the drug makers referred to a plan to coordinate ""polite f-u"" letters to his and Cummings' offices regarding the 2014 investigation.

""In my view, their 'polite f-u' letters designed to obstruct our investigation were clearly illegal,"" Sanders said. ""The Department of Justice must hold these bad actors accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

Cummings said he too was ""troubled by the allegations that Teva and its peers conspired to inflate the prices of lifesaving generic drugs, and that they obstructed our investigation in the process.""

""We cannot stand for this type of harm to the public or this interference with Congress' oversight responsibilities,"" he said in a statement. ""We will take all appropriate actions to ensure that generic manufacturers are held accountable for misconduct.""

The Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group representing generic drug manufacturers, said it ""believes in compliance with all competition and antitrust laws.""

""We take all instances of illegal behavior seriously. Anyone convicted of violating these laws should be punished appropriately,"" the group said in a statement. ""Vigorous, ethical competition is the foundation of the generic drug and biosimilar industry. Competition allows our companies to drive enormous savings and pass them on to patients, taxpayers and health care payors.""

The civil suit alleges that Teva and 19 other generic drug manufacturers schemed to increase prices affecting Medicare and Medicaid, the health insurance market and individuals. The lawsuit also named 15 senior executive defendants responsible for sales, marketing, pricing and operations. The drug companies have denied allegations of wrongdoing.

The lawsuit specified one report found that prices of more than 1,200 generic medications increased an average of 448% between July 2013 and July 2014.

At the time of the filing, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the suit may be the largest cartel case in the history of the United States.

In Thursday's letter to the Department of Justice, Cummings and Sanders urged the agency to ""prioritize criminal enforcement of federal antitrust laws against generic drug manufacturers."" They asked to be briefed by the agency by June 21.

""We are concerned about the lack of enforcement, particularly given serious allegations of anticompetitive behavior by generic manufacturers,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Vigorous antitrust enforcement is vital to ensuring that millions of Americans can afford the medications they need."""

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."

Holds Back Documents

Updated at 5:53 p.m. ET

The separation-of-powers standoff between Congress and the executive branch deepened on Wednesday over a dispute about access to materials involving the controversial citizenship question planned for the 2020 census.

The Justice Department notified the House oversight committee that it's withholding documents sought by the panel's chairman because it says they're shielded by executive privilege — the doctrine that permits an administration to conceal some of its internal workings.

The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd arrived electronically at the Capitol at the same time Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had convened a hearing at which the committee debated whether to find Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

After a day's worth of discussion and amendments, it did, voting 24 to 15 by the late afternoon on contempt for the Cabinet officials.

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., who has lately stepped up his criticism of Trump, broke with Republicans to support the measure.

The dispute over documents

Boyd's letter blamed Cummings for the administration's invocation of privilege.

The Justice Department has already provided tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses but nothing is ever enough, officials say — and Democrats' threats of contempt meant these talks can't continue.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said after the Oversight Committee contempt vote made no sense.

""The committee's attempt to define the Department of Justice's good-faith cooperation as 'contempt' defies logic,"" she said. ""Today's action by Chairman Cummings and his committee undermines Congress's credibility with the American people.""

The Justice Department has provided Congress with tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses on the census matter, Kupec said, over months of prior negotiations.

Cummings and the Democrats blame Barr, Ross and the administration for what they've called an effort to ""stonewall"" their investigation.

Critics argue that Trump's administration wants to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to suppress some responses, including those of Latinos, and Democrats say they want unredacted communications to see how the question was discussed inside the government.

""The census is critical to our democracy and our constituents,"" Cummings said. ""We must protect the integrity of the Census, and we must stand up for Congress' authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.

The action in the committee on Wednesday followed a vote by the full House on Tuesday authorizing chairmen such as Cummings to file civil contempt lawsuits in order to try to obtain testimony or evidence.

That's what may happen now following the oversight committee session on Wednesday: Cummings, with the assent of the House leadership, could file suit and ask a judge to order Barr and Ross to provide the census materials he wants.

Republicans have criticized Democrats' litigation strategy as a waste of taxpayer dollars given the court costs involved and also as a dangerous road for the House. If members of Congress file suit but lose, Republicans warn, they could harm the oversight powers of the House over the long term."

""We have identified now more than 4,800 family units that were fraudulent as they presented at the border,"" acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday. The family units tally represents the number of individuals, either a child under 18 years old, parent, or legal guardian, apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol, according to the DHS.

The new DHS chief said some migrants seeking to gain entry into the U.S. are paying smugglers to rent a child because families from countries other than Mexico and Canada cannot be held in federal custody more than 20 days.

However, the percentage of migrants using unrelated children to avoid immediate deportation is very low compared to the number of related families.

McAleenan also said the department has ""uncovered multiple child smuggling rings"" but did not share additional information.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the DHS agency that takes custody of people after Border Patrol have initially processed them, said it found more than 400 ""fraudulent"" family members over the most recent six week span measured, from mid-April to May 31.

Waxman'],,,,https://time.com/5605930/executive-privilege-history/,"When Congress issues a subpoena for documents, usually they get what they want. But that’s not the case for certain documents related to the 2020 Census question about citizenship, the Department of Justice said on Wednesday in a letter to Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The reason: President Trump is invoking executive privilege.



The committee voted to recommend holding Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoenas — though the committee’s Republicans say that the administration has already provided thousands of pages of relevant documents — but Trump is unlikely to face consequences for failing to comply. That’s because the doctrine of executive privilege, which Trump invoked for the first time in his presidency just a month ago, to block House Judiciary Committee Democrats from seeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s un-redacted report, gives presidents wide leeway to keep secrets.

So what is executive privilege? TIME once summed up the evolution of the concept as: “George Washington invoked it, Dwight Eisenhower named it and Richard Nixon abused it.” Here’s what else to know about the term and how its use has evolved over time.



What is executive privilege?

One oft-cited definition comes from Mark Rozell, author of two books on executive privilege and the Founding Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. He defined executive privilege in a 1998 Minnesota law review article as “the right of the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts and ultimately the public” when it comes to “(1) certain national security needs and (2) protecting the privacy of White House deliberations when it is in the public interest to do so.”

The term “executive privilege” is not in the U.S. Constitution, but it’s considered an implied power based on the separation of powers laid out in Article II, which is meant to make sure one branch of government doesn’t become all-powerful; executive privilege is one way the legislative branch’s power over the executive is limited. For example, when Congress investigated George W. Bush’s firing of eight U.S. Attorneys in 2006, the White House Counsel at the time, Fred Fielding, alluded to executive privilege in a letter referencing the “the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency.” But prominent constitutional law expert Raoul Berger famously called it a “constitutional myth” in his 1974 book, literally entitled Executive Privilege: A Constitutional Myth.

Why do presidents need executive privilege?

The basic idea behind executive privilege is that an entity like the U.S. government requires a lot of transparency, but also can’t function if there’s no possible way to speak about things confidentially.

“All reasonably complicated organizations need some space in which people can discuss what they’re going to do, with some degree of confidentiality. Why? If you know everything you consider is going to made public, or shared in some way, then that’s going to chill your ability to have frank and open discussion,” says Michael Dorf, a constitutional law expert at Cornell Law School. “The early understanding is simply that this is just a logical consequence of separation of powers, that each branch has to be able to assert its powers relative to the other branches.”

Generally, presidents will invoke executive privilege in matters relating to national security, the military and foreign affairs, for example to protect the names of spies and informants.

Who was the first President to invoke executive privilege?

The idea can be traced all the way back to President George Washington, who claimed it in 1792 when Congress asked him to turn over documents related to an unsuccessful military operation against Native Americans, according to Rozell’s report on the history of executive privilege for the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson once wrote that, after conferring with his cabinet members, Washington believed “that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit & ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public.” Washington also claimed it when Congress requested documents related to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty with England, arguing that “the nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy.”

And Jefferson is considered the first president to establish the precedent of only releasing parts of subpoenaed material; when he was subpoenaed by his political rival Chief Justice John Marshall to present documents for the treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr, who was accused of plotting to carve out the Western territories to form an independent republic, Jefferson initially refused to turn over the requested materials. The president must be able, he wrote, to “decide, independently, what papers coming to him as President, the public interest permit to be communicated, & to whom.” Jefferson eventually turned over the papers but maintained that he couldn’t be forced to do so; Burr was acquitted.

“Jefferson says that the court doesn’t have any power to issue this but I’m going to hand it over anyway because I’m a cooperative kind of guy,” says Dorf. “That set a pattern that I think we’ve seen ever since — that the President or members of an administration will cooperate to some degree, but say they’re doing so voluntarily.”

The specific phrase “executive privilege,” however, is more often said to have emerged in the 20th century. President Dwight Eisenhower invoked executive privilege more than 40 times. “Eisenhower took a very strong stand, especially during the McCarthy hearings,” Rozell told TIME in 2007. When Senator Joseph McCarthy demanded that White House officials testify in 1954 about suspected communists, “Eisenhower responded that any man who testifies to Congress about what advice he gave me will not be working for me by nightfall.”

How has executive privilege evolved?

One president who significantly changed the usage of executive privilege was Grover Cleveland, who “almost single-handedly” increased the power of the presidency in “his use of executive privilege in refusing to hand over department files to Congress in the fight over presidential appointments,” wrote Henry F. Graff, Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University.

But Cleveland isn’t the president most people think of when they think of executive privilege. Graff goes on to say as much: “No President prior to Richard M. Nixon had ever made such an extreme assertion of executive privilege in peacetime.”

Though plenty of others have invoked the idea, Nixon remains to this day the president most closely associated with the concept. In fact, the only Supreme Court case on executive privilege is United States v. Nixon (1974), which came about when he claimed executive privilege during the Watergate investigation to get out of a grand jury subpoena and avoid handing over recordings of his conversations in the White House.

In a unanimous decision — meaning that even the conservative justices whom Nixon appointed agreed — the court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes, arguing that presidents can’t just say that material is confidential in order to withhold criminal evidence. Here’s how TIME summarized the key points of the case in the Aug. 5, 1974, issue:

> The court firmly rejected Nixon’s argument that as head of the co-equal Executive Branch of the Government, he was entitled under the Constitution to determine finally the scope of his own privilege. On the contrary, the main theoretical plank of the court‘s opinion was the assertion of its supremacy in all matters of the law. The Judiciary’s power to interpret the law, the decision said, “can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a presidential veto.” Quoting directly from Chief Justice John Marshall’s decision in Marbury v. Madison, the court said, “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is” with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case. > The President’s claims of Executive privilege must give way to the needs of the courts to settle a criminal case. Neither the separation of the Executive and Judicial branches nor the need for confidentiality “can sustain an absolute, unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.” The court found that President Nixon’s claim of Executive privilege was too “broad” and “undifferentiated.” It showed no danger to the nation if the tapes were turned over to Sirica for in camera inspection. “We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.” …[T]he ruling was a narrow one. For one thing, as the President pointed out the day the decision was announced, the court “reaffirmed both the validity and the importance of the principle of Executive privilege.” The court, agreeing that “deference” should be accorded the “President’s need for candor and objectivity from advisers,” stated that the Chief Executive must be assured of confidentiality when discussing policy alternatives. Thus “the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”

Sixteen days after this decision was handed down, Nixon resigned.

Why is executive privilege still controversial?

While the court clearly upheld the idea of executive privilege, scholars say it’s still unclear how the decision applies beyond that particular case, leaving the potential for the idea to be exploited. What is the limit to its use and how will it be enforced are questions that continue to be debated.

Many scholars worried about that problem as soon as U.S. v. Nixon was decided; because Chief Justice Burger had taken care to lay out examples of moments when executive privilege was merited (concerning “military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets”) it seemed possible that future presidents merely had to invoke those ideas to hide whatever information they wanted.

Scholars say there hasn’t been enough case law to clarify whether a congressional investigation can override executive privilege. “Lower courts have tried to avoid the issue but have come down on the side of saying, ‘it’s a balancing test,’ Dorf says. “In the past, whenever possible, courts have tried to avoid making those judgments. So presidents have been very reluctant to assert executive privilege, and then the courts have tried to duck the issue, and they can. But the way things are going now, it looks not likely to be duckable — although you never know.”

Number of criminal environmental cases referred to DOJ by Interior at nearly 25-year low,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448342-number-of-environmental-criminal-cases-interior-referred-for,"The number of criminal environmental enforcement cases brought by the Interior Department has decreased by nearly 40 percent since 2016, according to internal data shared with The Hill.

Criminal environmental cases that often deal with unlicensed big-game hunting, illegal drug running, or oil and gas theft have all dropped to an almost 25-year low, according to the Interior data.

The tanking case referrals to the Department of Justice (DOJ), prosecutions filed and convictions come as law enforcement officer employment numbers at Interior are also on a downward swing.

Officers within the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and National Park Service are increasingly stretched thin, with employment numbers at both agencies at an all-time low, according to another set of information shared with The Hill.

The information was obtained by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) through Freedom of Information Act requests obtained personally and through the use of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The number of cases referred by Interior to the DOJ to prosecute in fiscal 2018 stood at 132, down from 154 in 2017 and 216 cases in 2016, Obama’s last year in office. At the height of referrals in 2000, 835 cases were sought.

The number of cases ultimately taken up by the DOJ to convict has also significantly decreased. In 2018, the agency prosecuted 161 cases, the lowest number of cases taken up since 1991, according to the Interior data. The highest number of cases brought in one year was in 2007, with 644 cases prosecuted.

The pattern of shrinking referrals largely aligns with the drop in law enforcement numbers across the agency. Bureaus within the Interior Department have historically witnessed a decrease in full-time law enforcement staff. The effect spans multiple presidencies.

The National Park Service has experienced steady declines in its permanent law enforcement workforce. Rangers dropped by nearly 14 percent between 2005 and 2016, from 1,548 rangers to 1,331, according to internal data.

At the BLM, after a beefing up in ranger numbers in 2009, law enforcement numbers drooped. In 2016 there were 185 rangers within the BLM compared to the high of 224 in 2012. In 2017, the BLM increased ranger numbers to 202.

Jeff Ruch, Pacific PEER director, said the data highlighted the importance of a robust Interior law enforcement crew.

“America’s natural resource heritage is at a growing risk of being looted with fewer cops on the beat inside agencies that are starving by attrition,” Ruch said in a statement.

“While there is growing attention to the infrastructure gap for capital improvements on national parks and other federal lands, we also need to start looking at the escalating human capital needs of these land management agencies.”

Interior did not return a request for comment.

Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service in the past year also canceled its permanent dual-function officer law enforcement program at Wildlife Refuges across the U.S. as a way to cut costs.

The department is facing a more than $11 million maintenance backlog, a reality Trump administration officials have pointed to for cuts. Yet the Trump administration's budget proposal released in March suggested cutting funding to Interior by 14 percent."
Newly released documents detail EPA's concerns over PolyMet,https://www.mprnews.org,"['Dan Kraker', 'Jim Mone', 'Ap Photo']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/13/newly-released-documents-detail-epas-concerns-over-polymet,"A former iron ore processing plant near Hoyt Lakes, Minn., that would become part of a proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine is seen in February 2016.

Updated 7:57 p.m. | Posted 5:23 p.m.

Staff scientists at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had serious concerns last year that the PolyMet copper-nickel mine might not be able to meet state and federal water quality standards under the Clean Water Act, according to documents released Thursday.

The scientists' comments were written more than a year ago in response to a key permit the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued to PolyMet Mining. But they were never submitted. Instead, they were released this week as part of a Freedom of Information Act case an environmental group filed against the EPA in an attempt to make them public.

In court filings, the St. Paul-based advocacy group WaterLegacy questioned whether the EPA comments had been suppressed as the MPCA developed the final water quality permit it eventually granted to PolyMet last December.

WaterLegacy and Minnesota U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum applauded the documents' release.

""All Minnesotans have a stake in ensuring that the quality of our water is protected, and the public has a right to access essential information about whether a project of this magnitude meets the spirit and letter of the law,"" said McCollum, who, as chair of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the EPA, had also pushed for the release of the documents.

The water quality permit and an air quality permit were the last two state approvals PolyMet needed to move ahead with its NorthMet copper-nickel mining project, which would be located near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes in northeastern Minnesota. It capped a review and permitting process for the controversial development — which is set to become Minnesota's first copper-nickel mine — that's stretched well beyond a decade.

Copper-nickel mining poses potentially more severe environmental risks than the state's long-established iron ore mining industry because the process used to extract the minerals from the sulfide rock can result in acid mine drainage, which can leach heavy metals and other pollutants into nearby surface and groundwater.

That's why the project's water quality permit, which sets limits on the pollutants that can be released into groundwater, lakes and streams, was so heavily scrutinized when the MPCA announced it had been issued in December.

Four environmental groups — the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness and WaterLegacy — along with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, quickly challenged the water quality permit at the Minnesota Court of Appeals. They argued the permit failed to comply with federal and state standards.

Soon after, in January, retired EPA attorney Jeffry Fowley filed a complaint with the agency's inspector general, alleging that administrators in the EPA's Chicago office had ""suppressed"" staff comments that were critical of the PolyMet water quality permit.

But in a brief filed Wednesday in the appeals court case, the MPCA acknowledged it had come to an agreement with the EPA ""that EPA would provide oral [rather than written] comments to MPCA."" The documents EPA released Thursday show that EPA staff had significant concerns about the permit. EPA scientists were especially concerned that it failed to include specific limits on the amount of pollutants the mine can discharge, — known as ""water quality-based effluent limits"" — which are put in place to ensure that projects can meet federal environmental standards.

EPA staff had prepared detailed written comments, but the agency never filed an objection to the MPCA's permit plan. And instead of publicly submitting those comments in writing during the public comment period part of the permitting process, staffers at both agencies agreed that the EPA would read them to MPCA staffers over the phone.

As a result, the EPA scientists' concerns did not become a part of the administrative record, which appeals courts rule on — and which the Minnesota Court of Appeals will rely on in its review of the MPCA's decision to issue the permit.

Fowley, the former EPA attorney who filed the inspector general complaint, said in a filing included in WaterLegacy's appeals court case that it was ""highly unusual"" that written comments on such a complex permit would not be part of the public record. ""In all of my years of experience,"" he wrote, ""I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone.""

Fowley worked for 37 years at the EPA office in Boston and specialized in Clean Water Act compliance. ""The apparent purpose for only receiving such comments over the phone would be to obtain them off the record — to avoid the MPCA receiving written comments which it would then need to be put into the administrative record for the permit and to which it would then need to respond,"" he wrote.

Fowley told the court last week that the EPA's inspector general had begun a preliminary inquiry into his complaint. The office announced Wednesday it was beginning an audit of the water quality permit issued by the MPCA ""to determine whether the EPA followed appropriate Clean Water Act ... regulations to review the PolyMet permit approved by Minnesota and issued in 2018.""

But in interviews and court filings, the MPCA argues it engaged in a robust back-and-forth with EPA staffers for several years in developing PolyMet's water quality permit. Officials insist it was neither out of the ordinary — nor unethical — for the agency to receive comments from federal regulators over the phone.

""I think it was the most effective way for [EPA] to make the comments and for us to react to them,"" said John Linc Stine, who was MPCA commissioner while the PolyMet water quality permit was being developed.

""There had been years and years of document exchange and comment back and forth,"" he continued. ""So, it seemed right to me to handle it by phone calls, so that we could get the permit finally resolved and drafted.""

Linc Stine said it wasn't unusual for the EPA not to submit written comments. MPCA officials said the agency's staffers engaged in regular conference calls with their EPA counterparts, and continually incorporated their feedback into the draft water quality permit.

But Paula Maccabee, WaterLegacy's attorney and advocacy director, said it's commonplace for the EPA to provide written comments on major industrial permits in Minnesota — and for the MPCA to provide detailed responses.

MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton emphasized that staffers from the state and federal agencies had frequent conversations during the permitting process. Those conversations, he said, resulted in substantive changes to the permit along the way, including additional limits on the discharge of several pollutants — including arsenic, lead and mercury — and ""language prohibiting violation of water quality standards.""

Broton said that's why the EPA did not object to the MPCA's final permit when the state agency sent it to them for final review.

But the Fond du Lac Band and environmental groups that brought the appeals court case argue that the limits included in the permit are weak and unenforceable, and aren't the same kind of restrictions that EPA scientists asked for in the comment letter released Thursday.

They also argue the permit, as written, could actually act as a shield to protect the company from potential liability.

""Without those effluent limits, Minnesota water quality won't be protected from the state's first proposed toxic sulfide mine,"" Water Legacy's Maccabee said.

WaterLegacy's appeals court case is one of several lawsuits making its way through state and federal courts seeking to overturn various approvals PolyMet received to build its mine.

Barring a successful legal challenge, PolyMet is clear to begin construction of the state's first-ever copper-nickel mine, once it raises the estimated $1 billion it will cost to build it. Later this month, PolyMet is expected to conclude a stock offering to clear debt from its balance sheet, which could result in the Swiss mining and commodities giant Glencore winning majority ownership of the company."
"Utah GOP Sens. Mike Lee, Mitt Romney split on Trump's Saudi Arabia arms sale",https://www.ksl.com,"['Lisa Riley Roche', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Jun']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46572706/utah-gop-sens-mike-lee-mitt-romney-split-on-trumps-saudi-arabia-arms-sale,"SALT LAKE CITY — Sen. Mike Lee has signed on to a Democratic-backed effort to block President Donald Trump's arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other countries, saying ""Congress has ceded too much authority to the executive branch.""

Lee, R-Utah, also said the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will support their involvement in the ongoing civil war in Yemen that Lee has strongly opposed.

But Sen. Mitt Romney is not among the four Republicans so far who are co-sponsoring a series of resolutions of disapproval, giving Senate Democrats enough votes to stall the $8 billion deal.

Still, Romney, R-Utah, has some reservations, even though he backs the sale.

“I support the Saudi arms sale,"" Romney told The Hill. ""I’m concerned about the process the administration has undertaken, and that’s something I’m taking a look at.”

Lee railed against the process in a statement issued Wednesday, after he joined fellow Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Todd Young of Indiana in opposing the deal.

""Circumventing Congress to sell arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE without following the standard statutory procedure undermines Congress' role in conducting oversight of the arms sales process and ignores the rule of law,"" he said.

What he said is a ""rarely used emergency loophole"" being used by the president to make a total of 22 sales to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan ""highlights the unfortunate reality that Congress has ceded too much authority to the executive branch.""

Trump has invoked an emergency provision in the federal arms exports law to bypass a congressional review period, amid concerns about Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen's civil war as well as in the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Lee said the sales ""will support Saudi Arabia and the UAE waging war in Yemen, even though it is long past time that we end U.S. involvement in this unauthorized, unjustified and immoral war that has caused immense suffering.""

In April, Lee and Utah's lone Democrat in Congress, Rep. Ben McAdams, were the only members of the state's delegation to vote for a resolution calling on Trump to remove U.S. forces from Yemen, later vetoed by the president.

US report finds sky is the limit for geothermal energy beneath us,https://arstechnica.com,['Scott K. Johnson'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/report-geothermal-could-power-up-to-16-of-us-grid-by-2050/,"With all attention focused on the plummeting prices and soaring popularity of solar and wind, geothermal energy is probably under-appreciated. Sure, you might think, it’s great where you can get it—in, say, Iceland or the Geysers area of California—but those are exceptions, right? Not entirely. Geothermal power sources come in many forms, and they're typically much more subtle than steam shooting out of the ground. In reality, geothermal energy could be a big player in our future mix.

That is made clear by the US Department of Energy’s recently released “GeoVision” report. The report follows similar evaluations of wind, solar, and hydropower energy and leans on information from national labs and other science agencies. It summarizes what we know about the physical resources in the US and also examines the factors that have been limiting geothermal’s deployment. Overall, the report shows that we could do a whole lot more with geothermal energy—both for generating electricity and for heating and cooling—than we currently do.

Heat and power

There are opportunities to more than double the amount of electricity generated at conventional types of hydrothermal sites, where wells can easily tap into hot water underground. That's economical on the current grid. But the biggest growth potential, according to the report, is in so-called “enhanced geothermal systems.” These involve areas where the temperatures are hot but the bedrock lacks enough fractures and pathways for hot water to circulate freely—or simply lacks the water entirely.

The technology used in natural gas fracking—injecting pressurized fluid underground to form fractures in the rock that released trapped gas into horizontally drilled wells—could be adapted to generate electricity in sites like these. Creating fractures and/or injecting water to get heated by these rocks eventually results in a similar geothermal plant setup, but it takes a lot more engineering than just jamming a straw into a source that's already sending hot water to the surface.

Advancing enhanced geothermal techniques alone could produce 45 gigawatts of electricity by 2050. Add in the more conventional plants, and you’re at 60 gigawatts—26 times more than current geothermal generation. And in a scenario where natural gas prices go up, making geothermal even more competitive, we could double that to 120 gigawatts. That would be fully 16 percent of the total projected 2050 generation in the US.

Additionally, that electricity can be generated around the clock and can even be flexibly ramped up or down, making it an excellent pairing with intermittent forms of renewable energy like wind and solar.

On the heating (and cooling) side, there are two main areas of opportunity. Traditional ground-source heat pumps circulate fluid through loops in the ground to provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and they could be much more widely adopted with minimal effort. The report estimates that installations could increase 14 times over, to 28 million homes by 2050, covering 23 percent of national residential demand. Accounting for limitations in how quickly the market could realistically change brings the number down to 19 million homes—still a massive increase.

There’s even more potential for district heating systems, where a single, large geothermal installation pipes heat to all the buildings in an area. There are only a handful of such systems operating in the US today (Boise, Idaho, has an example), but the report finds more than 17,000 locations where it would make sense, covering heating needs for 45 million homes.

Limited adoption

The report focuses a great deal on the barriers that have so far prevented this eye-popping potential from being realized. Some barriers are indeed technological—those enhanced geothermal systems have yet to reach maturity, for example. Some barriers are simply down to a lack of awareness that things like ground-source heat pumps are already viable options.

But the biggest barriers are financial. Geothermal power plant projects suffer from much higher capital costs (and therefore slower payback times) than other forms of renewable energy. Techniques for placing wells at traditional hydrothermal sites are surprisingly unsuccessful, with many wells failing to produce enough to go into use. With better maps and more advanced site characterization, the misses could be reduced, bringing down costs.

The report also highlights permitting on federal lands as less than smooth. Between awkward overlaps when multiple agencies are involved and backlogs in understaffed departments, it points to approvals that could be consolidated to simplify the process. Streamlining, the report says, could shorten the time it takes to complete a project and reduce the financial risk of starting one. Separately, the constant uncertainty surrounding short-term tax credits for renewable projects also does geothermal no favors.

The 2050 scenarios in the report are based on plausible improvements to these barriers combined with modeling of the economics and operation of the nation’s energy grid. To make the projected numbers a reality, a set of key steps are laid out. Those include the streamlining of permitting, continuing research into the engineering of “enhanced geothermal systems,” improving methods for reducing trial and error at new installations, and outreach to increase awareness of geothermal options.

The other key is maximizing the value of each project. As flexibility is increasingly valued on the grid, compensating geothermal for that value would make it more profitable. There are also a variety of possible industrial uses for heat across the range of ground temperatures—everything from warming greenhouses to aiding cement production. A broader set of applications could help grow the geothermal industry, bringing costs down with scale.

If you’re a geothermal fan and an optimist, the report lays out a tantalizing amount of potential, although it lists plenty of challenges between here and there. In an intro to the report, DOE Geothermal Technologies Office Director Susan Hamm writes, “[T]his report shows us how to move the geothermal dial from what we know exists to what we envision is possible over the next 30 years. The GeoVision analysis takes us beyond a declaration of resource potential by illustrating what is real today and painting a picture of what could be real tomorrow.”"
US Treasury yields tick lower as jobless claims data add to economic concerns,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-as-trade-tensions-continue.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell Thursday after President Donald Trump refused to set a timeline for levying tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods and jobless data showed more Americans filing for unemployment benefits than expected.

At around 2:17 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at 2.08%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down to around 2.597%.

Prices climbed 1.8% from the previous year while the so-called core gauge rose 2%, both falling short of economists' expectations.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week and fostered mounting worries that the labor market is losing steam after job growth decelerated in May. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended June 8, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

The Treasury Department auctioned $16 billion in 30-year bonds at a high yield of 2.607%. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.32. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 60.8%. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 15.1%."
"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior",https://www.sciencemag.org,['Paul Voosen'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/keep-landsat-data-free-panel-urges-interior-department,"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior

A federal advisory panel today called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to keep access to the imagery from its long-running Landsat satellite program free and open. Any effort to collect fees for such data would generate little money and would actively damage the U.S. remote sensing industry, the panel said in a report.

The Landsat program, which began in 1972 and is managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has produced the world’s longest-running series of satellite images, documenting the vast global changes caused by humanity over the past 47 years. Two Landsat satellites are now in orbit, taking 1200 images a day at a 30-meter resolution. In 2008, USGS stopped charging for use of Landsat images, creating a surge of academic research, along with users in government and industry. The move created about $2 billion in annual economic benefits, according to estimates from earlier this decade. The Landsat annual budget, meanwhile, is about $80 million.

In 2017, DOI asked its National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) to evaluate the possibility of once again imposing charges for using Landsat data, among other approaches to raising revenue. The move, when reported last year, was met with an outcry from scientists in the United States and abroad, along with federal and state agencies and nonprofits running a diverse range from the Wyoming state engineer to the Global Forest Observations Initiative. “The community was very vocal regarding the value of a free and open data policy,” said Frank Avila, a remote-sensing scientist at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Springfield, Virginia, who leads the NGAC subcommittee that authored the report approved today.

The NGAC report echoes those sentiments, according to a presentation by Kevin Pomfret, a lawyer at Williams Mullen in Tysons, Virginia, who led the NGAC study and specializes in remote sensing. An effort to charge for Landsat data would largely drive users to free alternatives offered by the Europeans, while still costing the government a significant sum to run. The net result would be a drain on the U.S. economy, the study said. “Charging a fee for Landsat data will result in negative economic impacts,” Pomfret said at the meeting, and “would not be worth the economic, legal, societal, or political costs.”

The report also explores whether USGS, which runs Landsat, might instead keep the core Landsat data free, while charging for “value-added” imagery or specialized tasks carried out by the satellites. Such a move might raise revenue, the report says, but it could also require substantial regulatory or legal changes. Similarly, money could potentially be saved by hiring a contractor who could more efficiently manage digital access to the Landsat data, but USGS must study this idea more closely.

If DOI is concerned about the cost of the Landsat program, the report concludes, it would be better served by looking at how to reduce the cost of the satellites themselves, rather than attempting to reap revenue from their data. Although the next Landsat satellite, the ninth in the series, is set for a launch in December 2020, USGS and its partners, including NASA, are mulling what the future of the program should look like, especially given the rise of competitors such as the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellites and commercial constellations like Planet. A study on the program’s future architecture is due later this year.

Although the NGAC report was approved unanimously by the panel’s members and will be available online this week, it is ultimately up to DOI to decide whether it will go through with any fees, says Timothy Newman, program coordinator for national land imaging at USGS. But given the report and the nearly universal negative reaction to charging fees, he says, “The reality is that I just don’t see it happening.”"
"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

DOJ watchdog: FBI lost track of 62 foreign cooperators in U.S.,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/international/448271-doj-watchdog-fbi-lost-track-of-62-foreign-cooperators-in-us,"The FBI lost track of more than 60 foreign cooperators in the U.S. after sponsoring them to aid in investigations, according to a report released Tuesday by the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Office of Inspector General.

In addition, the watchdog's audit identified 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was not provided information on in February 2018. By that August it was still seeking information from DOJ on 665.

While DHS facilitates the cooperators' entries into the U.S., the DOJ takes custody of them once they are in the country.

“We believe that all DOJ components need to improve their execution of the responsibilities integral to the sponsorship programs, including enhancing the policies for monitoring the locations and activities of sponsored foreign nationals and the management information systems used within the program,” the report says.

The 62 people that absconded included both “benign” absconsions by foreign nationals who simply failed to notify their sponsoring agent of a move and “deliberate” ones by people purposely evading law enforcement. The report does not specify how many of each it identified.

The OIG found 22 cases of people who absconded without the DOJ notifying the DHS until a 2018 review.

In another 18 cases, the DOJ let foreign nationals’ sponsorship lapse, which put them at risk for being detained and deported while the DOJ was still using them for investigations, according to the report.

To address such issues going forward, the report states, the DOJ should ensure the DEA and FBI take all necessary steps to help DHS located absconded people, as well as developing compliance processes for DHS reporting requirements.

The department should also “institute a more efficient process to resolve DHS’s existing unresolved sponsorship matters and ensure that any future sponsorship matters needing resolution are addressed expeditiously,” the report states."
DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech that low prices or free products won't protect them,https://www.foxnews.com,['Christopher Carbone'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/doj-antitrust-big-tech-low-prices-free-products-wont-protect,"The Justice Department's assistant attorney general highlighted the antitrust case against Silicon Valley's major players during a Tuesday speech.

Makan Delrahim described a range of possible arguments against tech companies as his office takes the lead in probing Google and, possibly, Apple. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is overseeing inquiries into possible antitrust practices of Facebook and Amazon.

After discussing the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the 1982 dissolution of AT&T into the ""Baby Bells"" and the government's successful monopoly case against Microsoft in 2001 – which arguably helped lay the foundation for the success of Google and Yahoo – Delrahim explained several arguments that could be made against the world's most powerful tech companies on antitrust grounds.

Offering Low Prices or Free Services

Critics have pointed out Amazon's undeniable power in the area of American e-commerce and its foray into the world of bricks-and-mortar retail, but the company's defenders note the consistently low prices it offers on a gigantic array of consumer goods. In addition, Facebook and Google offer a multitude of services for free.

SILICON VALLEY IN THE CROSSHAIRS: GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AMAZON AND APPLE FACE BIPARTISAN ONSLAUGHT

WHY IS NANCY PELOSI IGNORING FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG?

But Delrahim said the Justice Department takes a much broader view.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low,"" he said in his speech at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference. ""It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.""

Besides price, ""diminished quality"" is a factor the Justice Department would consider.

""As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection. Moreover, two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,"" Delrahim said.

Exclusive Agreements

Delrahim said the Antitrust Division has a history of investigating ""exclusive conduct"" under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

""[Exclusivity agreements] also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition,"" he said. ""This is true in digital markets as well.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO RADICALIZATION, TOP TWITTER EXEC SAYS

The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft focused in part on that company's inclusion of its own browser in its Windows operating system, which the federal agency found discouraged users from seeking alternatives.

“This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim added.

CREEPY DEEPFAKE AI LETS YOU PUT WORDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH

Swallowing Up Competitors

Facebook and Google have gobbled up hundreds of other companies – some of them former competitors – over the last two decades. Delrahim indicated that this type of behavior could be considered anticompetitive.

“It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality,"" he said. ""Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.”

According to The New York Times, Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades, including YouTube, which was a competitor to Google Video; Waze, which competed with Google Maps; and DoubleClick, which had been the tech giant's chief advertising competitor.

Facebook has acquired 92 companies since 2007, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The Menlo Park, Calif. based company also bought and shut down other social networks, including Gowalla, Beluga and Nextstop, the Times reports.

AMAZON'S SECOND NEW YORK GO STORE SERVES COFFEE, ACCEPTS CASH

Still, Delrahim said that acquisitions can be positive if they ""combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise.""

Although these investigations may take years to complete, Delrahim made it clear that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at Silicon Valley's main players.

""While antitrust is not a panacea for every policy challenge presented by the digital market, the Antitrust Division will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anticompetitive conduct and transactions where justified,"" he said. ""That is because where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections.""

President Donald Trump Reveals First Design Mock-Up of New Air Force One,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-06-13/president-donald-trump-reveals-first-design-mock-up-of-new-air-force-one,"President Donald Trump shared never-before-seen photos of the proposed redesign of Air Force One.

The president showed the mock-ups to ABC News as part of an interview that aired Thursday and said he designed them himself. The new designs feature an American flag on the tail of the plane with a red, white and blue design along the body.

Trump announced he would redesign Air Force One about a year ago, saying the planes were outdated. He said he would do away with the iconic baby blue color scheme, which date back to President John F. Kennedy's administration, and design the planes to be more patriotic

In July, it was announced that Boeing Co. was awarded a $3.9 billion contract to manufacture two 757-8 aircraft to serve as the new Air Force One. Trump told ABC that the new planes are ""a 747, but … it's a much bigger plane"" with a larger wingspan.

The reveal comes after lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to restrict spending on renovation plans, ABC reported.

Although the term Air Force One can be used to describe any Air Force aircraft carrying the commander in chief, it typically refers to one of two highly modified and customized Boeing 747-200B series planes.

The 4,000-square foot aircraft include a presidential suite, medical operating room and a large kitchen, ABC reported.

The president said the new aircraft will come with new features and ""a couple of secrets."" The new planes will not be ready until 2024.

House Dems push Trump to fill high-level Interior vacancies,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448467-house-dems-push-trump-to-fill-high-level-interior-vacancies,"House Democrats are pushing the president to speed up nominations to the Interior Department on the heels of a complaint the agency is temporarily filling roles with existing staff to avoid seeking Senate confirmation.

“Fifty-nine percent of key [Interior] positions have yet to be filled; fewer than half of those vacant even have a nominee awaiting Senate approval,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, wrote in a letter to President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel OKs space military branch Harris calls Trump 'a national security threat' after he says he'd take information from foreign power Harris calls Trump 'a national security threat' after he says he'd take information from foreign power MORE.

“Your administration is abdicating its constitutional duty to nominate qualified individuals into these important roles, instead enlisting individuals in an acting capacity who are more loyal to a political agenda than the missions of the agencies and departments they should be leading,” the letter said.

The administration has numerous vacancies in high-level positions across multiple departments and agencies.

Grijalva’s letter outlines a long list of positions that have gone unfilled at Interior, ranging from the deputy of the department to agency heads that oversee offshore oil and gas leasing, land management and mining.

On Tuesday, an ethics group filed a complaint with the agency's Office of Inspector General, saying the department had shuffled controversial employees into roles using steps that avoid Senate confirmation.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility argued the agency is violating federal law on vacancies by “temporarily redelegating” roles to existing employees for the 27th time under the Trump administration.

A May 23 order from Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was the latest example of the maneuver.

Grijalva asked the administration to produce a detailed timeline of when they plan to make nominations for the numerous vacancies."
"South Delta residents, enduring the longest flood since 1927, hope the EPA reverses course on Yazoo Pumps",https://mississippitoday.org,"['Alex Rozier', 'Mississippi Today', 'Phil Mccausland', 'Nbc News']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://mississippitoday.org/2019/06/13/south-delta-residents-enduring-the-longest-flood-since-1927-hope-the-epa-reverses-course-on-yazoo-pumps/,"Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

REDWOOD, Miss. — The chest-deep water currently surrounding Stormy Deere’s house is expected to remain there until at least July. The home she lives in with her husband is safely elevated on a mound of dirt and brick, but she has had to take a boat to reach it since early March.

Nothing has changed for months.

Deere, 44, loads her dogs on the boat twice a day when she must take them for walks, though she leaves the smallest one at home for fear of the alligators that live in these waters. This way of life, she said, is untenable.

“Emotionally, I have good days and I have bad days,” she said. “Some days I’m ready to go, some days I look outside and I want to despair. I want to just lie down and die. But that’s not an option.”

Record rainfall has led to the persistent flooding this year. That’s caused the Mississippi River at nearby Vicksburg to remain above flood stage, which is the water level that can cause massive flooding, for more than 114 consecutive days. That’s the longest span since 1927, according to the Mississippi River Levee Board. The water has also reached the highest level since 1973.

And while 2019 has been extreme, flooding in the Yazoo backwater area, as this part of the state is known, happens nearly every single year. Since 2000, there have only been five years when it hasn’t flooded here.

Families that call this southern part of the Mississippi Delta home have put up with standing water for months. Via community meetings and social media, they have attempted to draw attention to their plight — all to little avail.

The river has now laid waste to 550,000 acres of the Mississippi Delta, including 225,000 acres of farmland, and affected more than 500 homes. But it is expected to rise again this week, entering a major flood stage, according to the National Weather Service, and those waters won’t recede until at least July.

“It is unbelievable just the vastness of this, and the hundreds of homes that are flooded, and the highways that are underwater, and the hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland that are underwater,” Peter Nimrod, chief engineer of the levee board, said.

Dubbed “the forgotten flood” by locals, it comes amid natural disasters that have caused billions of dollars of damage across the Midwest in the past several months and in turn claimed the national spotlight.

The difference is that in this part of the country, many residents believe there is a solution to their persistent, yearly flooding woes — if only the government would cut through the red tape to enact it. Locals like Deere believe that an unfinished U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project known as the Yazoo Pumps, a potential drain for the levee system that protects the Delta, would hold back the floodwaters that regularly threaten almost 20,000 people here.

On Wednesday, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith sent a letter to President Donald Trump requesting approval for temporary pumps, referencing pumps the Corps installed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina as a precedent. The letter did not include details on costs or impacts on wetlands, which have long stalled such a project.

Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

Environmental advocates and longtime civil servants who have worked on the project, however, argue that the pumps come at a high cost, potentially draining tens of thousands of vital wetland acres that supports one of the most unique wildlife habitats in the country.

The project has been debated for almost 80 years, with frustration and anger building with the passing time.

Residents of the region, local farmers and Mississippi politicians are calling for the revival of the pumps — a project vetoed by George W. Bush’s administration, called “one of the worst projects ever conceived by Congress” by Sen. John McCain in 2004, and endlessly decried by environmental advocates.

Some believe the pump project could now find new life, despite unparalleled hurdles, thanks to renewed interest from the Trump administration. A few enterprising locals have even gone so far as to pitch in for two billboards that read: “President Trump, finish the pumps!”

As if in answer, the Trump administration announced that the Environmental Protection Agency would review the project after prodding from Mississippi’s congressional delegation.

Now Deere, like many here who have suffered from the widespread flooding, wants the government to act quickly and build the pumps, despite the fears of massive environmental degradation and the four years and hundreds of millions of dollars it would require.

“No one’s asking for the Delta to not flood. No one’s trying to drain wetlands. No one’s trying to kill the gnat or the pondberry bush. No one’s trying to take away the waterfowl hunting because we duck hunt as well,” Deere said. “We just want what they promised.”

A silver bullet or a lie?

The pumps are a civil works project that have long loomed over this region since they were first proposed and authorized in 1941. Though they were never built, plans for the pumps were reviewed by the Corps in every ensuing decade except the 1970s — often at the direction of Mississippi politicians.

That still holds true.

Both Mississippi senators — Republicans Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker — as well as Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents the Delta region, and Republican Gov. Phil Bryant have recently voiced their support for the pumps. It’s also a topic in a tight Mississippi governor’s race.

“It’s like the third rail of Mississippi politics: You have to be for the pumps,” said Leonard Shabman, a water and environmental researcher who has worked with the Corps and the EPA on the pumps since the 1980s.

Now Mississippi politics has pushed the current administration to act, many noting that there are 22 federally funded pumps within 200 miles of the Yazoo backwater area. Every levee system in the lower Mississippi Valley has a pump plant except here.

The levees at these different sites create a bowl shape, and during high-flood events, those bowls begin to fill with water. A pump, the Mississippi Levee Board said, is the only effective way to help drain that water away and is necessary in this region.

Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

An EPA spokeswoman said in an email that the agency has noted the “economic and disruptive impacts” of the Mississippi flooding and planned to find solutions.

“The Agency strongly supports the goals of improved flood protection and wetland protection for the residents of the Mississippi Delta,” she wrote. “EPA will work with the Corps and the local Levee Board to review updated data and other information as it relates to our regulatory programs and oversight.”

The discussion of pumps appears to arise whenever the area faces intense flooding, but environmental protection advocates and former civil servants who worked on the issue for decades didn’t think it would come up again after the EPA, under the Bush administration, vetoed the pumps in 2008.

It was only the 12th time in history that a project was vetoed under the Clean Water Act, and a federal court upheld the EPA’s right to veto the project when the Mississippi Levee Board sued in 2011.

When it came time for the veto, Ben Grumbles, the former assistant administrator for water at the EPA and Maryland’s current secretary of the environment, said he “proudly signed the decision.”

“It was a hard decision because EPA knew the area needed flood protection but our analysis of widespread environmental impacts, costs, and other complications fully justified the veto at the time,” he said in a statement to NBC News that emphasized that his views did not necessarily reflect those of Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican.

Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

Conservationists say the Delta’s bottomland hardwood wetlands create one of the most important ecosystems in the country. Twenty percent of the nation’s ducks, 450 different species, including 257 species of birds, rely on these wetlands’ natural resources.

They could be devastated by the pumps, according to the EPA’s veto, which said that 67,000 acres of wetlands could be drained if the pumps were installed. The agency also commissioned a report prepared by Shabman during his tenure at Virginia Tech that concluded that even if the pumps could guarantee that the area would never flood again, the amount of money saved is “far below what would be necessary to … justify such a project.”

Now, after the veto, it would likely take an act of Congress to authorize the pumps that are expected to cost north of $300 million. That or the unlikely prospect of overturning an EPA veto, something that has never been done before and would likely lead to a lengthy court battle with environmental advocates.

Considering those requirements, many who have long followed the case say the pumps are a pipe dream

“There are layers of reasons why this is a bad project,” said Melissa Samet, senior counsel at the National Wildlife Federation, who has followed the project for decades, ”but worst of all is it really gives a false promise of hope to people who are suffering from flooding.”

Unexplored alternatives

Jack Branning, 87, has owned his 2,500 acres of land next to the Delta National Forest since 1996. He said there’s 5 to 10 feet of water on parts of his property now, but flooding has been a persistent problem for him since he started farming in the area.

The floodwaters have gotten exceptionally high 10 of the last 11 years, he noted.

Because of those rising waters, Branning entered his property into the Wetlands Preserve Program in 1999, which provides him compensation for the land that he can’t farm if he allows it to be reforested.

“We did that because the program added value, in my opinion, to the land because the land had been cleared and being farmed unsuccessfully numerous years,” he said. “It may do OK for two years and then in two years the high water comes and it didn’t do very well. We farmed it for three years, I did, and it didn’t do very well.”

Branning said he’s happy that it’s helping the environment and noticed that some wildlife has returned, which is good for him as a hunter. Nevertheless, while Branning thinks he’s better off than his neighbors, he still supports the pumps.

Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

“I try to see everybody’s point of view,” he said. “It all depends I guess on how you view the world. In the case of the backwater, I view the pumps as something that should have been done.”

Buyouts, wetland reforestation and raised homes and roadways are ideas proposed by Shabman in another report that he produced for the EPA about potential alternatives. Environmental advocates, however, claim local leaders were never curious to explore such ideas because they didn’t come with expensive construction contracts benefiting a small number of people in Mississippi.

Because of the environmental and financial costs, Grumbles said that the EPA moved forward with the veto in 2008 to clear the way for federal agencies to explore new solutions.

“Alternative, nonstructural flood control measures and measures that didn’t involve the large pumps (which would drain so many wetlands) never got much traction so the only solution at the time was to use the veto pen and commit to work with the Corps, the levee board, and impacted communities in the future on a more acceptable project,” Grumbles said in his statement.

Still, nothing constructive happened in the decade that followed the veto. And because of the project’s expense, Shabman added, it is unlikely the pumps would ever have received funding anyway.

“The veto just made the thing end. No one picked up an alternative. No one said, ‘What else can we do?’” he said.

Shabman also thinks there’s little hope for the Trump administration to come up with an answer.

Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/Report For America

“If you look at what could be done between FEMA, EPA, USDA, the Corps and others, it’s possible you could do something that passes muster with the current authorization that would pass Congress and actually get funded,” he said. “But I’m not sure there’s that much creativity in this administration.”

The debate matters little, however, to the people of the Mississippi Delta whose homes are now gone, damaged or under threat.

Mike Brown, a longtime resident who works as a trucker and farms corn and soybean on 700 acres near Redwood, said these alternatives ignore the simple fact that the place he calls home is now gone.

Four feet of water occupies Brown’s house right now, and he said he’s lost thousands of dollars renting a house south of Vicksburg for four months. In the meantime, he’s only received $500 from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency since he had to flee his home and abandon part of his livelihood.

“We just need the government to finish what they started, finish the pumps,” said Brown, who recently found a casket floating in the floodwaters. “The flooding seems to get worse every year. It’s really damaging our livelihood, I’ve also got cattle, I do a little farming. It’s damaged everything that it can damage.”

DOJ settles with First Merchants Bank after ‘redlining’ allegations,https://fox59.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://fox59.com/2019/06/13/doj-settles-with-first-merchants-bank-after-redlining-allegations/,"× DOJ settles with First Merchants Bank after ‘redlining’ allegations

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana filed a complaint and a settlement agreement resolving allegations against First Merchants Bank on Thursday.

In the complaint, DOJ claimed that First Merchants Bank practiced lending discrimination by “redlining” predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Indianapolis from 2011 to at least 2017.

“Discriminatory race-based lending practices have no place in our District,” said Josh Minkler, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. “This case involving First Merchants Bank shows our commitment to ensure this reality.”

The term “redlining” describes illegal practices in which lenders intentionally avoid providing services to individuals living in predominantly minority neighborhoods because of the race of the residents in those neighborhoods.

The complaint alleged that First Merchants adopted a residential mortgage lending policy that effectively denied residents of predominantly African-American neighborhoods equal access to credit in violation of the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

According to the settlement agreement, pending court approval, First Merchants will expand its marketing, lending and banking services to specifically include predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Indianapolis:

Invest $1.12 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase credit opportunities to residents of predominantly African-American neighborhoods

Devote $500,000 toward advertising, community outreach, and credit repair and education

Open a branch and loan production office to serve the banking and credit needs of residents in predominantly African-American neighborhoods

Employ a director of community lending and development who will oversee these efforts with bank leadership

“We commend First Merchants for cooperatively resolving this case by taking steps to ensure that its residential lending products and services are made available to everyone in Indianapolis, regardless of race,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division."

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) (Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

For the second time this year, workers at a science division of the Agriculture Department voted overwhelmingly to unionize in apparent revolt against the administration’s plan to relocate them from Washington, D.C., to a yet-to-be-announced location.

On Tuesday, employees at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which distributes $400 million in competitive grants to researchers around the country each year, voted 137 to 2 to be represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union. In May, the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency also included in the relocation, voted 138 to 4 to unionize with AFGE.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement distributed to reporters before the votes were counted. In August, Perdue announced the relocation as a cost-saving measure that would move scientists closer to those they serve, a claim critics dispute.

In early May, USDA announced that Kansas City, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and the state of Indiana had been selected as the leading candidates for relocation sites. The department has not said when it would make a final decision. “I truly believe that the relocation of ERS and NIFA will help to fulfill USDA’s commitment to be the most effective, most efficient and most customer-focused agency in the federal government,” Perdue said in the statement.

But former USDA officials and leaders in the agricultural community argue the relocation will paralyze the agencies, and have also warned that this proposal is an attempt to weaken the influence of scientists under the Trump administration.

Members of Congress were divided largely along partisan lines. At an Agriculture Committee hearing last week, Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the secretary “has broad support to move forward with this decision.” But Democrats in both chambers have introduced legislation to block the move, and they dispute whether the secretary has the authority to relocate the offices without congressional approval.

Peter Winch, a union organizer for AFGE, said that the newly formed union would ask the department to allow employees to visit the proposed relocation site and to give them more than 30 days to respond to reassignment letters.

The unionization vote comes as the Trump administration has taken a confrontational approach toward federal employees and their unions with executive orders, new policies creating a faster path to firing and tough stances at the bargaining table.

At a rally on Tuesday morning, about a dozen NIFA and ERS employees waved American flags and handed out pro-union stickers. Unionization would “delay changes to working conditions” and offer “protection from political interference,” according to the fliers they distributed. Those who spoke to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared professional repercussions. Many employees are applying for new jobs in the District, and few said that they would consider relocating.

A senior NIFA employee said that the push to unionize “would never have happened without the secretary of agriculture.” Another lamented the absence of a USDA chief scientist, who in previous administrations had been the voice of scientists in the department.

A third employee said the workload — the number of grant awards to be processed — has quadrupled due to high attrition and the lasting effects of the federal government shutdown this winter. NIFA’s $1.7 billion budget supports cutting-edge research as well as rural communities and programs like 4-H. “The mission still has to be done,” the person said, but the “morale is not great.”

Inside the NIFA office building, workers waited for up to an hour to vote. Three-quarters of NIFA employees eligible to cast a ballot did so. About 30 people watched as an official from the Federal Labor Relations Authority counted the votes. NIFA employees cheered when the final tally was announced.

“Waiting for the department to give us a voice was not going to happen,” the senior NIFA employee said. The relocation process, which has “generated considerable frustration,” the person said, “provided a lot of motivation for employees to form a union in order to have a voice.”

The administration has argued that its pro-management policies are an effort to make government and its employees more efficient and able to serve the public. But the actions have created anxiety in federal offices and resulted in court challenges.

Last year, a federal judge shot down the bulk of three White House executive orders that were designed to bring a pro-management atmosphere to federal offices.

Among the toughest provisions was a drastic cut to what is known as official time, legally mandated spans that union officials spend on the clock representing their members in grievances and other disputes. The executive orders also sought to make it easier for managers to fire poor performers.

The judge’s ruling is on appeal, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the administration has worked around the constraints of the court ruling at the bargaining table.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo energy & environment Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Story Continued Below

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.



The hilltop mine leases land owned by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"

""Afraid."" ""Concerned."" Or just plan ticked off.

That is what past leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency said they felt when they think about the direction the agency has taken under President Trump.

Four former EPA chiefs — three Republicans and one Democrat — spent Tuesday criticizing the EPA's shrinking size and ambition in testimony on Capitol Hill, saying the agency has moved away from its core duties under Trump, The Post's Brady Dennis and I reported.

“I’m deeply concerned that five decades of environmental progress are at risk because of the attitude and approach of the current administration” Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

""Climate change is real, and the administration is abdicating its responsibilities by denying it,"" added Whitman, once the governor of the coastal state of New Jersey.

Similar worries dominated the testimony of Gina McCarthy, who led the EPA during the final years of the Obama administration and has been an outspoken critic of the current one.

Like Whitman, McCarthy bemoaned the exodus of longtime EPA employees and what she calls the sinking morale of many career staffers. She and others raised questions about whether the Trump administration is adequately relying on science to drive its policy decisions, and said the White House is ignoring the threat of climate change amid an aggressive push to scale back environmental regulations.

And for McCarthy, the Trump administration is in the process of rolling back her own work.

“I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and it’s not to weep about all my precious rules being rolled back. Although I admit that the constant roll back is beginning to tick me off a bit,"" McCarthy said. ""Maybe even more than just a bit.""

""I’m here to remind the political leadership at the EPA that what they do matters, and it’s time for them to step up and to do their jobs. Just do your jobs,"" she continued, adding the current EPA seemed to value lowering costs to industry more than safeguarding public health.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the testimony. Earlier this year, the agency touted its work during the first two years under Trump, highlighting dozens of deregulatory actions and saying that it had “continued to deliver on its promise to provide greater regulatory certainty while protecting public health and the environment.”

The Hill hearing was intended to “address the mission and future” of the agency, according to Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee chairman. It comes after seven past EPA chiefs, representing Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote to House lawmakers in April, offering Congress help with oversight of the agency.

“We are united that there has never been a more important time for us to put aside our differences and advocate collectively for public health and the environment,” they wrote in the letter, which was first reported by E&E News.

The letter was signed by the EPA’s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, a Republican who also has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach, as well as a host of other past leaders.

The ex-EPA chiefs, who served under Reagan, Obama and both Bushes, pressed Congress to use its oversight power to rein in the current deregulatory push and to ensure the EPA relies on science over politics in its actions. House Democrats who invited the former officials echoed their concerns and promised they are already looking into the rollback of air and chemical rules.

“The four former administrators with us this morning truly know what is at stake and how to accomplish EPA’s mission,” Pallone said.

Some Republicans on the committee criticized McCarthy’s management of the EPA for what they saw as exceeding her authority, pointing to the EPA’s efforts to drastically slash emissions from coal-fired power plants.

“Under her leadership, I think the EPA went rogue,” Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.) said.

Other Republicans emphasized how often their constituents, many of whom are rural farmers, have to contend with difficult-to-understand regulations on pesticides and fertilizers. And at times, the former administrators acknowledged the challenges of making the public understand their work.

“It’s not an accident that the president can say the kind of things he said about wanting to break up EPA into little bits,” said former administrator William Reilly, who served under George H.W. Bush.

But Reilly still expressed apprehension with what he sees as the pro-industry direction the agency has taken, with its revisions to Obama-era air pollution rules on mercury and methane.

He noted that while the EPA needs to consider the ""economic impact"" of its actions, ""the environment and health come first.""

Lee Thomas, a Republican who led the EPA from 1985 to 1989, compared the current EPA management to the tenure of Anne Gorsuch Burford — Reagan’s controversial first EPA administrator.

Burford, the mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, resigned amid sharp budget cuts, a rift between political and career staff and a scandal over mismanagement of the Superfund cleanup program.

“EPA in 1983 was in the middle of chaos and turmoil,” Thomas said. “There were six different congressional committees that were investigating what was going on at EPA … There was a deregulatory agenda. There was an attack on science at many levels.”

“All that sound familiar?” he added. “ Well there’s an awful lot of that going on today.”

POWER PLAYS

— 2020 watch: Joe Biden told a Greenpeace activist he supports having a climate-focused presidential debate. “We should,” Biden said when asked on a ropeline after a speech in Iowa. “I think that’s what we should be doing. …Yeah, I’m all in. Take a look at what I’m talking about – and by the way, the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress? Biden.”

The context: “Biden has been at pains to emphasize his devotion to climate action, especially since an aide was quoted as saying Biden would take a ‘middle road’ to fighting climate change — a characterization he strongly disputes,” The Post’s David Weigel reports. Biden’s remarks make him the 15th Democratic candidate to endorse a climate debate.

Meanwhile: The chair of the Democratic National Committee defended his decision not to hold a single-issue debate. He called climate change an “urgent threat” and insisted he’s “confident that climate change will receive more attention than ever before — and deservedly so.” But he said “[t]o amend these rules now, after having enforced them throughout this primary process, would be putting our thumb on the scale,” he said in a post on Medium. “If we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had?”

In response: Democratic contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is running on a climate change platform, said the DNC “won’t recognize the climate crisis as an existential threat, but instead has chosen to treat it as a pet issue of one candidate.”

Trump in Iowa: While speaking at the Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, the president touted his work on ethanol while taking a jab at Biden. “I fought very hard for ethanol,” Trump told the audience. “Under the previous administration, our leaders rejected American energy and they rejected ethanol.""

Biden fires back: The former vice president criticized the Trump administration’s tariffs between the United States and China, which he said “crushed” the state’s farmers, during remarks in Iowa, The Post’s Matt Viser, John Wagner and Jenna Johnson report. “[Trump] thinks he’s being tough,” Biden said. “Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.”

Biden's legacy on ethanol: The ex-vice president ""was considered instrumental in orchestrating the blending cuts as a way to help struggling refineries on the East Coast deal with rising compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard,” per Reuters. “A federal court struck down the cuts in 2016. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to make the biofuel industry whole for the lost gallons despite repeated promises to do so.”

— It'll be harder for China to choke the U.S. of “rare earth” minerals than it thinks: Amid escalating trade tensions between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China is threatening to hold these minerals hostage as retaliation. The elements are linchpins of many high-tech products such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and nuclear reactors. And China’s share of global production was at more than 97 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But: According to The Post's David J. Lynch, the U.S. economy is more resilient to such a rare-earth ban than it appears. New mines in California, Australia and Myanmar have shrunk China's production share to 71 percent last year. And any embargo won't be foolproof, with rogue operations in China last year producing an estimated 60,000 tons of rare earths.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). (Damian Dovarganes/AP)

— Democratic chair wants an explanation for the suppression of congressional testimony on climate: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) sent letters to the State Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence demanding more information about the White House’s suppression of written testimony about “possibly catastrophic” consequences of climate change. The Post first reported last week that the White House blocked a State Department intelligence agency from submitting written testimony to Schiff’s committee about the national security threat from human-driven global warming. “

If these reports are accurate, I applaud your Bureau for standing by its analysts and the integrity of its analysts and the integrity of their work in the face of political pressure, but the Committee remains gravely concerned about the events surrounding [bureau senior analyst Rod Schoonover]’s withheld written testimony,” he wrote in the letter to State Assistant Secretary Ellen McCarthy, who oversees the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

Schiff’s demand: The chairman called for details about communications with the White House on any review process for the written testimony as well as testimony from McCarthy or other officials to explain the basis for Schoonover’s analysis.

— Bernhardt’s accidental interview: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt spoke with the Colorado Independent after remarks at the Western Governors Association meeting in Vail, Colo. He reportedly agreed to the interview because he thought it was with his hometown newspaper, the Glenwood Springs Post Independent. He spoke briefly about climate change and about national parks, mentioning that he recently saw structures in Acadia National Park that are “literally crumbling.” “You may go look at a campground and charcoal grills are falling down, the amenities don’t work, the water doesn’t turn on when you turn it on,” Bernhardt said, telling the publication he’s hoping to address park maintenance by raising entry fees and visitor costs.

— Adrift in the Arctic: This fall, scientists will launch the largest Arctic research expedition ever, to document how climate change is affecting the fastest-warming region on Earth, as The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports from Utqiagvik, Alaska. “What the scientists discover during their year in the frozen north will help them forecast the future of the entire planet,” she writes. “Struggling on the sea ice off Alaska during their training this April, they get a taste of how tough the task will be. They are steeling themselves for what awaits at the pole: profound isolation and protracted darkness, laborious experiments, cold that can plunge to 45 degrees below zero. There are countless ways the Arctic might thwart and threaten them at every turn.”

By the numbers: It will take one year and $134 million and will be part of a 17-nation project. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, a 387-foot research station, is scheduled to launch on Sept. 20 and will see a rotating set of 300 meteorologists, biologists, oceanographers and ice experts.

— A “new climate regime”: A study published this week in the journal Earth’s Future warned about a “new climate regime” with “extraordinary” heat waves, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. He points to heat waves that killed hundreds and hospitalized thousands across the Northern Hemisphere last summer, a pattern that may be part of a new normal. “The study’s modeling analysis, conducted by researchers in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, found heat events like last summer’s do ‘not occur in historical simulations’ and ‘were unprecedented prior to 2010,’ ” he adds. “As the climate warms, the study projects that the area affected by heat waves like last summer’s will increase 16 percent for every 1.8 degrees (1 Celsius) of warming.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is slated to speak to reporters at the Department of State on Thursday.

Pompeo's remarks follow attacks of unknown origin on two tanker ships off the coast of Iran, which stoked fears of conflict in the already high-pressure region of the Middle East.

Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration believes it knows who is responsible for the incident and will share its conclusions Thursday.

Oil prices shot up as much as 4% on Thursday after the attacks, which occurred near the Strait of Hormuz — the world's busiest sea lane for oil shipments.

Homeland Security’s Jeanette Manfra is coming to Disrupt SF – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/jeanette-manfra-disrupt-sf/,"We can’t talk cybersecurity without hearing from the government.

We’re thrilled to announce Homeland Security Assistant Director Jeanette Manfra, a senior executive at the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will be at Disrupt SF.

Manfra is one of the federal government’s most experienced cybersecurity civil servants. She currently leads CISA’s cybersecurity efforts in protecting and strengthening the country’s most important infrastructure, like the power grid and water supplies. A decade-long government career professional, she previously served as acting deputy under secretary for cybersecurity at the National Protection and Programs Directorate, a division of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting government networks and critical infrastructure, later absorbed by CISA after the agency was created by President Trump in November 2018.

Prior to Homeland Security, Manfra served in the U.S. Army as a communications specialist and a military intelligence officer.

For years, cybersecurity warfare was somewhat limited to governments attacking governments. But the threat landscape has changed, and the new battleground is both in government and in the private sector.

Now under one roof, CISA acts as the nation’s cybersecurity risk adviser — working closely with government departments to protect federal systems and networks, and private industry to advise and warn on ongoing and emerging threats.

The agency has recently doubled down on its efforts to ensure election security, as well as risks to the U.S. supply chain.

Cybersecurity is one of those universal topics that affects every consumer, business, enterprise and government. We’re excited to talk shop with Manfra about the state of the security union.

Disrupt SF is in San Francisco on October 2-4; tickets are available here."
