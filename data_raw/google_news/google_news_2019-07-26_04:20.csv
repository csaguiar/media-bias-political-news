How Trump Ended Up Onstage With a Fake Presidential Seal,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Sarah Mervosh', 'Niraj Chokshi']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/presidential-seal-trump.html,"“This is the most petty piece of art I think I’ve ever designed,” said Charles, who is based in Virginia and works in video production and graphic design. “This was every petty, little thing I could think of to needle him because he was driving me bananas with his politics.”

After he created the altered seal, Charles shared it with friends, who encouraged him to sell it online, so he created a website and store and quickly moved on with his life. Then, on Thursday morning, he said he was surprised to come across his creation in a news article while he was drinking coffee and scanning Reddit.

“It kind of made my day,” he said.

The doctored image quickly became a talking point among liberals and conservatives alike. Online, some delighted in the dig and called it “brilliant trolling.” Others denounced the switch as an offense worthy of dismissal.

The alterations were subtle enough.

The traditional presidential seal contains the image of an eagle, which holds arrows representing war in one talon and olive branches representing peace in the other. A banner above its head bears the motto “E Pluribus Unum,” Latin for “Out of Many, One.”

The eagle in the altered image had two heads, a symbol featured on the national emblem of Russia, the flags of several other countries and the logos for two Trump golf resorts in Scotland. The symbol is often associated with power and empire.

In that seal, the eagle clutches golf clubs and what appears to be a wad of money in its talons. The banner above its head reads “45 Es un Títere,” Spanish for “45 Is a Puppet.” And a shield across the eagle’s chest features five instances of the hammer and sickle, a Communist symbol associated with the Russian Revolution.

The event was an unlikely setting for criticism, and it is unclear if the president was aware of the fake seal. He spoke for nearly 80 minutes in front of a supportive audience. The real presidential seal appeared on the lectern and on another part of the screen.

President Trump Rips Sweden over A$AP Rocky Case,https://www.tmz.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/25/president-trump-rips-swedish-prime-minister-asap-rocky-case/,"TMZ

President Trump is sticking up for A$AP Rocky by dressing down the Swedish Prime Minister ... the Prez says he's very disappointed Sweden's leader didn't step in to help A$AP skirt an assault charge.

POTUS just went on a Twitter tantrum against the European nation and its government ... demanding the Swedes give A$AP his freedom and telling Sweden to fix crime in their country.

Trump says he's ""very disappointed"" Sweden's Prime Minister was unable to act, and he says the inaction has let down the African-American community in the United States.

The Prez claims he's watched the video footage of A$AP's street brawl in Stockholm, which shows him trying to play peacemaker before finally losing his cool and absolutely pummeling his attacker, who has a criminal record.

Trump also rips Sweden for not treating Americans fairly ... and he slams the country for not doing anything to help our citizens when ""we do so much for Sweden.""

As we reported ... A$AP was officially charged with assault Thursday, and he will remain in a Swedish jail as he awaits next week's trial.

Trump and the State Dept. already tried to butt in on behalf of A$AP before the Harlem rapper was charged, but to no avail.

Maybe Trump's new Twitter salvo will move the needle."

According to a Fox News poll released Thursday, the four highest-polling Democrats among primary voters nationwide are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.

The president also criticized another 2020 candidate, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling him a ""horrible mayor"" after viral videos surfaced earlier this week showing NYPD officers being doused with water while onlookers jeered.

TRUMP CALLS OUT DE BLASIO OVER ATTACKS ON NYPD OFFICERS: 'SHOULD ACT IMMEDIATELY!'

""They don't like him, they don't respect him,"" Trump said of de Blasio's relationship with the NYPD. The president cited numerous occasions where officers have turned their backs on de Blasio over his unwillingness to defend police officers against criticism by Black Lives Matter advocates.

""I think that was tragic watching that scene,"" Trump said of the videos, adding that he was in disbelief at one video that showed a person hurling a red bucket that hit an officer in the head while he was making an arrest in Harlem. Groups of bystanders could be heard mocking and taunting the officers as people splashed them with water.

""Let me see that again, I don't believe it,"" Trump said, rewatching the video multiple times.

The president said he spoke to the NYPD Thursday about the incident and decried the mistreatment of law enforcement.

""New York's finest ... they are devastated,"" he said."
"Automakers, Rejecting Trump Pollution Rule, Strike a Deal With California",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Coral Davenport', 'Hiroko Tabuchi']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html,"On Thursday morning, a wider group of automakers held a meeting to consider joining the pact, the executive said, although there were no immediate sign-ons. Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen had initially decided to keep the group small, he said, because a wider group would have been more difficult to bring together, raising the prospect that word would get out and the deal would collapse.

An executive at another large automaker said his company was considering joining the agreement because it included meaningful concessions by California. The executive, who spoke on condition that neither he nor his company be identified, said that the Obama-era fuel economy standards were difficult for the industry to meet because car buyers increasingly prefer sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that tend to have much lower fuel economy than sedans.

Margo Oge, a former senior E.P.A. official who worked on auto emissions policy and now serves as an informal adviser to several auto companies, said, “I have been calling all these companies and telling them to cut a deal with California. I think G.M. and Toyota will also have the courage to sign on.”

Trump administration officials said the California deal would not stop their plans to put forward a new federal rule to allow more tailpipe pollution. The deal “has no impact on E.P.A.’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act,” wrote Michael Abboud, an E.P.A. spokesman, in an email. “This voluntary framework is a PR stunt that does nothing to further the one national standard that will provide certainty and relief for American consumers.”

The new agreement would also give automakers more leeway in meeting the fuel economy standards through other means, like earning credits for fuel-saving technology.

Some environmental groups criticized the slower pace and expanded loopholes the deal awarded the automakers. “That means more pollution, less savings at the pump and a bad precedent for future standards,” said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit group based in Washington.

The carmakers are addressing a crisis that is partly of their own making. Soon after Mr. Trump was elected, the chief executives of the United States’ Big Three auto companies — Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler — met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and asked them to loosen the Obama emissions rules. But the automakers have since grown alarmed at the expanding scope of the administration’s plan."
The Trump administration is bringing back federal executions,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/25/8930191/federal-execution-death-penalty-bill-barr-trump-administration,"US Attorney General William Barr ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Thursday to resume capital punishment for federal prisoners for the first time in nearly two decades, and to change the drugs it uses to carry out executions.

Five people, all of whom have been convicted of murder and other crimes, now have executions scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020. There are currently 62 individuals on federal death row, and the federal government has executed only three people since 1988.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr said in a statement.

The five inmates to be executed are Daniel Lewis Lee, who murdered a family of three; Lezmond Mitchell, who killed a 63-year-old woman and her 9-year-old granddaughter; Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and killed a 16-year-old, in addition to two other victims; Alfred Bourgeois, who molested and killed his 2-year-old daughter; and Dustin Lee Honken, who fatally shot five people.

The death penalty has been on the decline in America: Although it’s still legal in 29 states, the number of executions carried out each year is falling, and the number of new death sentences is also on the decline. But at the federal level, the Trump administration wants to reverse the trend.

The federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003, and there’s a nationwide pushback against the practice

The death penalty as it was practiced in the US, including state and federal executions, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia in 1972, and then reinstated in 1988 when Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.

Federal executions, though, were not reinstated until 1988, and then for only a narrow range of cases, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 expanded the number of eligible offenses to 60, but the first federal execution still didn’t occur until 2001.

Federal executions are rare — only three people have been executed by the US government — because the death penalty, like most of the criminal justice system, works largely at the state level. The federal government continues to seek the death penalty, but federal executions were under an informal moratorium under President Barack Obama, who ordered the Justice Department in 2014 to conduct a broad review of its lethal injection practice and the drugs it uses.

Support at the state level is falling as well. In May, New Hampshire became the 21st state to abolish the death penalty. There are several explanations: Support from the general public is declining, there’s a persistent shortage of lethal injection drugs, the cost is high, and there’s a growing realization that the punishment is applied unequally.

The benefits of the death penalty are also simply questionable. As Vox’s German Lopez wrote:

The research and experts have long been skeptical that the death penalty actually deters or prevents more crime. As the Death Penalty Information Center noted, a 2009 survey of the US’s top criminologists found that 88 percent “do not believe the death penalty acts as a deterrent to homicide” and 87 percent “believe that abolition of the death penalty would not have any significant effect on murder rates.”

Experts also argue that the death penalty is inhumane. New York University professor David Garland, who has done extensive research on crime and punishment, called the practice “unnecessary and barbaric.”

“The idea that the government should be permitted deliberately to take the life of a living human being is an outrage when we have punishments — such as life in prison without parole — that serve the same criminal justice ends but do so more effectively and more humanely and in a more civilized way,” he said in an interview.

Amnesty International USA executive director Margaret Huang criticized the administration’s move, calling it out of step with both national and international trends.

“The Trump administration’s decision to restart federal executions after a 16-year hiatus is outrageous,” she said. “It is the latest indication of this administration’s disdain for human rights. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment. It is a system flawed beyond repair, and the federal government should not proceed with any executions.”

There are still states that practice executions regularly, such as Texas, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. But for many states, death penalty sentences have been rendered almost useless as governors have vowed to block them or courts have shut them down as unconstitutional. It seemed like the government was backing these states with its informal moratorium on executions — until now.

Using pentobarbital is the government’s solution to a shortage of traditional lethal injection drugs

Another major change to the government’s execution protocol is the swap from a three-drug cocktail to just pentobarbital. A traditional three-drug cocktail consists of sodium thiopental, which induces unconsciousness; pancuronium bromide, which causes muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.

But there’s been a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental. Since 2010, drug companies have refused to supply executioners with the drug for ethical reason or simply because they do not want to be associated with the practice.

In 2011, Hospira, the only US supplier of sodium thiopental, announced it would no longer produce the drug after pressure from a global campaign by death penalty activists. Since then, several states have had to delay their executions as they try to procure the drug from overseas.

Some states, however, have turned to pentobarbital, a drug that is commonly used as a sedative during surgeries. Before being used in the US as a substitute lethal injection drug, it was better known as a euthanasia drug in Europe. Texas was the first state to use the drug for lethal injection in 2012, and according to the Justice Department’s statement, 14 states have used it in more than 200 executions.

Yet the use of pentobarbital has been controversial because some claim it isn’t painless as promised. When Anthony Shore was executed with pentobarbital in 2018, he shouted, “I can feel that it does burn. Burning!” Several other Texan inmates made similar statements before their death. The Texas Department of Justice, however, refutes these claims and said the drug has been used for years without incident.

One big question is how the US will obtain pentobarbital, which is getting increasingly harder to obtain. Lundbeck, a Danish company that makes it, condemned the US for using its drug for execution and had even banned its US distributors from providing executors with the drug. Most states have a stockpile of lethal injection drugs — Texas has 27 doses left — but they’re quickly depleting.

It might not even matter that the US government won’t be able to proceed with the executions. If anything, the Trump administration is trying to make a political point here, Garland said.

“The federal death penalty being reinvoked and executions being scheduled is to make a political point, not because this is a government that feels that criminal justice can’t work if these individuals aren’t executed,” he said. “But purely to communicate that this is a tough government willing to put people to death to show its bravado and its masculinity.”"
"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says",https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-says-bitcoin-escrow-firm-bilked-investors-for-7-million,"U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
Lawmakers urge Trump to delay $10B defense contract over Amazon conflicts probe,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dozen-reps-urge-trump-to-delay-10b-defense-contract-over-investigation-of-amazon-conflicts,"The Pentagon is gearing up to award a massive $10 billion winner-take-all contract for cloud computing, but 12 members of Congress are pushing President Trump to hold off on the award until after the conclusion of an investigation related to one of the bidders.

The finalists for the large contract -- known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) -- are Amazon and Microsoft, but allegations about conflicts of interest related to Amazon are currently under investigation by the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office. The concerns are based on Defense Department staffers who worked on the deal who previously or subsequently worked for Amazon, or in at least once case, both. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as August 23.

ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR TARGETS FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND AMAZON IN BROAD ANTITRUST PROBE

""It is unclear if the [Inspector General's Office] will issue its findings prior to the [Department of Defense's] expected award date in August,"" the lawmakers wrote in their Tuesday letter, which was obtained by Fox News. ""Therefore, we request that your Administration instruct [the Defense Department] not to award JEDI until the [Inspector General's Office] has had an opportunity to complete and report on its investigation.""

The lawmakers who signed Tuesday's letter are all Republicans and include Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sent a similar letter to national security adviser John Bolton last Thursday, seeking a delay to the awarding of the JEDI contract due to a ""lack of competition.""

A bid protest complaint from Oracle, who had also bid on the contract, pointed to the involvement of former Defense Department employee Deap Ubhi, who worked at Amazon before joining the Defense Department in August 2016. Ubhi is now at Amazon once again -- working with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), the entity that handles cloud computing.

Oracle claimed that Ubhi influenced the decision to grant a single contract so that Amazon could get it. They also said he was involved in setting high standards for bidders that essentially limited the field to Amazon and Microsoft. AWS said in a court filing that Oracle overstated Ubhi’s role in JEDI.

Defense Department spokeswoman Heather Babb told Fox News that the department investigated allegations of conflicts of interest, but ultimately found that the JEDI process was not improperly affected.

""While some potential ethics concerns were raised that have been referred to the DoD OIG, DoD has concluded that there is no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process,"" Babb said.

A federal judge ruled against Oracle earlier this month, leaving the Defense Department left with Amazon and Microsoft as the two finalists.

Last week, President Trump commented on the JEDI contract and said that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at it.

""I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” Trump said when asked about the matter. ""They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid.""

AMAZON ASSISTANT BROWSER PLUGIN RAISES PRIVACY CONCERNS

Trump has feuded for years with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The president has also criticized the Washington Post, which Bezos owns.

Meanwhile, Rep. James Langevin, D-R.I., has expressed opposition to any interference from Trump, given challenges to the bidding process have already been addressed.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
US Department of Justice Accuses Crypto Exec of $7 Million Fraud Scheme,https://cointelegraph.com,['Max Boddy'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-justice-accuses-crypto-exec-of-7-million-fraud-scheme,"Federal authorities in the state of New York have unsealed fraud charges against the principal of a purported cryptocurrency escrow company Volantis in the amount of over $7 million.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business."

She also reportedly suggested that Obama was trying to convert the U.S. to Sharia law and that conspiracies about his birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns.""

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" Crowley wrote in an April 2011 post.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she said.

Trump was one the most prominent proponents of the birther movement, which falsely held that Obama, who was born in Hawaii, is not actually an American citizen.

In a 2013 blog post, Crowley suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

US to resume executions of federal death row inmates after 16 years,https://www.yahoo.com,['Nick Allen'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-resume-executions-federal-death-173547732.html,"Across the United States there are more than 2,600 people on death row, - Los Angeles Times

The US government is to resume executions of death row inmates after a hiatus of 16 years.

Lethal injections have been scheduled for five convicted child killers, beginning in December.

Across the United States there are more than 2,600 people on death row, but the vast majority are under the jurisdiction of individual states.

A total of 62 prisoners are on the federal US government's death row, and the new policy of implementing sentences applies to them.

The move follows Donald Trump's vocal support for capital punishment, which has included praise for Singapore's application of the death penalty, and suggestions it should be extended to drug traffickers.

Federal executions had lapsed since 2003 due to several factors including doubts over the efficacy of lethal injection drugs, and opposition from some justice department officials in the Obama administration.

Bill Barr, the current US attorney general, said: ""The justice department upholds the rule of law and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.""

He said the five scheduled to die had been convicted of ""murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society - children and the elderly,"" and their final appeals were already exhausted.

The first inmate to be executed, on Dec 9, will be Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist convicted of murdering a family of three, including an eight-year-old girl.

Also among those given executed dates was Lezmond Mitchell, who was convicted of murdering a woman and her granddaughter.

The others were Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and murdered a teenage girl, Alfred Bourgeois, who sexually molested and killed his young daughter, and Dustin Lee Honken, who shot dead five people including two children.

High profile prisoners on federal death row, who were not among the five, include the Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and Charleston church mass shooter Dylann Roof.

The move comes after a procession of states abolished the death penalty, or allowed it to lapse, over the last decade.

Story continues

In March, California, the state with the largest death row, introduced a official moratorium on executions.

The five federal inmates are all due to be executed at a US government jail in Indiana.

Lethal injections will be performed using a single drug - phenobarbital - replacing the three-drug protocol previously used in federal executions.

However, Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said there could be legal challenges to that.

He said: ""You can't just say it and have it happen. There is a legal process for a protocol to go into effect and there is a legal process for challenging the protocol."""
Republican lawmakers issue dueling letters over Pentagon 'war cloud' contract,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/454829-republican-lawmakers-issue-dueling-letters-about-pentagon-war-cloud,"Republican lawmakers this week issued dueling letters over the Pentagon’s $10 billion “war cloud” contract, with one group calling for the deal to be delayed amid concerns that it favors Amazon above other companies, while others insisted the cloud-computing contract should be wrapped up by this summer.

In a letter obtained by The Hill, a dozen GOP lawmakers urged President Trump Donald John TrumpMcConnell, Paul offer bill to cement tax provision benefiting bourbon makers Creating opportunity for all Scarborough implores Democrats: Go hard after Trump or he'll win in 2020 MORE to delay the war cloud contract over long-standing allegations that the contract is biased toward Amazon.

The letter, dated July 23, asked Trump to discourage the Department of Defense (DOD) from awarding the contract before the Pentagon’s watchdog office has completed an investigation into potential conflicts of interest. The Pentagon inspector general's office is looking into allegations that some DOD employees drew up the contract with Amazon in mind due to close ties with the company.

The 12 House Republicans who signed on to the letter are not on the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the Defense Department. Most of the lawmakers do not sit on any defense-related committees, and the letter does not mention Amazon by name.

""JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure) is a winner-take all contract that will go to a single company to provide cloud computing services to DOD for ten years,"" they wrote. ""OIG [Office of Inspector General] is investigating because DOD employees involved in JEDI had previous ties to or left DOD to work for a company bidding for the contract without properly recusing themselves.""

""It is unclear if OIG will issue its findings prior to the DOD's expected award date in August,"" they continued. ""We request that your Administration instruct DOD not to award JEDI until the OIG has had an opportunity to complete and report on its investigation.""

In a separate letter on Thursday obtained by The Hill, two members of the House Armed Services Committee — Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Rep. Paul Cook Paul Joseph CookRepublican lawmakers issue dueling letters over Pentagon 'war cloud' contract Native American groups press Congress to rescind Wounded Knee medals House lawmakers look to reassure Australia after Mattis resignation MORE (R-Calif.) — argued the contract should be awarded as soon as possible for national security purposes.

“This contract has already been delayed a year for investigations and court filings,” Banks and Cook wrote. “Further delays make DOD fall behind and DOD needs this technology now. The cloud makes the military a more lethal, agile and innovative force.”

“Awarding JEDI now means our warfighters will have access to critical information faster, which will help them accomplish missions and safely return to their families,” they added.

The document echoes a separate letter sent last week from four GOP House Armed Services Committee members, including ranking member Mac Thornberry William (Mac) McClellan ThornberryOvernight Defense: Trump vetoes Saudi arms sale resolutions | A look at Esper's first day as Pentagon chief | Iran, 'forever chemicals' mark early priorities | Budget deal set for Thursday House vote New Pentagon chief to tackle Iran with Centcom Hillicon Valley: Intel chief creates new election security position | Privacy groups want role in new tech task force | Republicans urge Trump not to delay Pentagon cloud contract MORE (Texas).

""Our committee has conducted oversight of this contract from the beginning,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""While it is understandable that some of the companies competing for the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of the finalists, further unnecessary delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract.""

The letters, both addressed to Trump, are the latest attempts by lawmakers to weigh in on how the contract — also known as JEDI — was constructed and how it will be doled out.

This week’s action from Capitol Hill follows critical remarks from Trump, who said last week that he would ask his administration to look “closely” at allegations that the Department of Defense favored Amazon when it drew up the contract.

“Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it, having to do with Amazon and the Department of Defense,"" Trump said, adding, “I have had very few things where there’s been such complaining.""

A stream of Republican lawmakers in recent weeks have sent letters to the president over the contract. Sen. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioTensions flare amid Saudi fight in Senate Technology companies press Trump as Huawei deadline nears Ana Navarro lashes out at Rubio for calling outrage over Trump's 'go back' tweet 'self righteous' MORE (R-Fla.) — who has been accused of having close ties to one of Amazon's top competitors in the process, Oracle — penned a letter to Trump asking him to delay the deal earlier this month, followed by others.

Rubio, critics have pointed out, received millions of dollars from Oracle during his presidential campaign.

Nearly all of the lawmakers involved in the discussions have received thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Amazon and Microsoft, the two top contenders for the JEDI contract. And some have received contributions from Oracle, a smaller competitor that has launched an aggressive campaign to open up the cloud-computing deal to other companies.

The bitter battle over the lucrative JEDI contract, which would allow one company to create cloud-computing infrastructure for the department, has dragged on for more than a year. The contract is expected to be awarded sometime next month to either Microsoft's cloud-computing arm, Azure, or Amazon's, Amazon Web Services. Experts have noted it's most likely to be Amazon, given the company's cloud-computing capabilities.

Oracle, a smaller software company with cloud-computing services, has accused the DOD of writing the contract specifically for Amazon, which the Pentagon and Amazon have both categorically denied. The DOD has responded that Oracle did not meet the standards laid out by the JEDI contract, and a federal judge earlier this month ruled Oracle did not have evidence to substantiate its claims.

Several government investigations have cleared the DOD of nefarious activity, though the Pentagon’s inspector general is continuing to investigate some ethics concerns. Amazon has continued to insist it is the company best-equipped to handle the breadth of sensitive and classified data that the contract calls for.

A group of former military leaders and chief information officers this week also released a report calling for JEDI to be “rescinded and revised,” arguing it is counter to the DOD’s cloud strategy.

“Where the JEDI RFP [request for proposal] stipulates a single, static cloud solution, the strategy outlines a rich environment including multiple cloud solutions,” the report from the Information Technology Acquisition Advisory Council reads.

The DOD declined to comment to The Hill on Thursday."
John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after the president fired ex-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, testified that he was not involved in the approval chain for the final FISA renewal."

SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes has become one of the company's biggest problems.

In recent weeks, Hughes, who left the social media giant in 2007 and cashed out his nearly $500 million worth of stock, has been making the rounds in the nation's capital, visiting a dozen lawmakers and regulators at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies which are all interested in examining whether Facebook has amassed too much power. He's talked with the attorney general of New York's staff.

In those meetings, which he sometimes attended on his own, he has presented a 39-page slide deck that makes a point-by-point legal case for breaking up the social network drawing on decades of antitrust law precedent.

The crux of the case, designed by two antitrust scholars: Facebook's wealth and power and massive user base have pushed it into monopoly territory, and its acquisitions of rivals have squashed competition. More than 2.7 billion people use Facebook or its other platforms, which include Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, at least once a month, Facebook said Wednesday.

""I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what's going on,"" Hughes said in an interview Thursday. ""And I think there's a lot to be concerned about.""

Hughes, who helped develop the social media giant with Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard college dorm, has become a critical weapon to trust busters in a fight that keeps expanding in scope, threatening tech giants including Amazon, Apple and Google with potential new regulation or even a breakup. Just this week, the Justice Department said it was launching a new, expanded probe targeting ""market-leading online platforms,"" And on Wednesday, Facebook disclosed it is facing an antitrust probe by the FTC.

He has become one of the most powerful in a new breed of antagonists to Facebook: A former executive who believes he created something is now harmful to society.

Facebook declined to comment. Some of Hughes' lobbying was first reported by the New York Times.

The growing momentum in the District of Columbia to more closely scrutinize the role of tech giants in consumers' lives and the effect on competition - one of the few bipartisan issues emerging among lawmakers and candidates across the nation - has often been fueled by private complaints by small businesses and rivals that feel they've gotten a raw deal as the massive companies dominant their relative spaces.

Facebook, for its part, has argued vociferously that it is not a monopoly and should not be broken up. Testifying before Congress in April 2018, Zuckerberg responded to a question about the competition Facebook faces by pointing out that the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with friends. ""It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,"" Zuckerberg said when asked if Facebook was a monopoly by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Hughes started his campaign publicly. After leaving Facebook to volunteer for President Barack Obama, he worked for years in politics and nonprofits, plus a four-year stint as owner of publication New Republic. In 2016, he helped found a think tank focused on inequality, a topic he wrote a book about last year. The research prompted questions regarding the dangers of the concentration of corporate power.

""I had a very personal realization that I cannot speak to anything that has to do with antimonopoly work without wrestling with my own past,"" he said. ""The huge monopoly power is why I have the financial resources that I have.""

Hughes wrote a widely read New York Times op-ed this summer arguing that the company he helped found should be broken up.

The decision to come out publicly in the op-ed was a difficult one, Hughes said.

""I knew I would lose some friends over it. And that's OK because some things are that important,"" he said. ""But it's been nice on the other side of it too, to have the argument out there, to speak my mind about what I think and believe.""

Facebook's Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, responded to the op-ed by writing his own several days later arguing that Facebook should not be dismantled. ""What matters is not our size but rather the rights and interests of consumers, and our accountability to the governments and legislators who oversee commerce and communications.""

Soon after, Hughes was contacted by two prominent antitrust scholars, Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School and Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. The two academics and longtime collaborators had been developing an argument for breaking up Facebook. To them, the purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp represented a ""plain vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit,"" Wu said in an interview. They began to pitch lawmakers and regulators together.

Academics and lawmakers who have worked with Hughes say he has been helpful in explaining the motivations and viewpoints of key players at Facebook, including Zuckerberg -- though Hughes says he has no specific inside knowledge. They say Hughes can frame the business practices of present-day Silicon Valley in ways that jive with largely untested antitrust laws that were written for major oil and rail companies decades ago.

After House lawmakers embarked on their sweeping antitrust investigation of Facebook and its fellow tech giants in June, one of the first people they consulted was Hughes, said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the panel's chairman. Hughes quietly paid a visit to members of the House's top competition-focused panel earlier this month, meeting with lawmakers and their staff to pitch many of the issues he raised in his op-ed.

Hughes presented his views as a former Facebook insider, something that loaned credence to his arguments, Cicilline said. ""It's remarkable and significant to me and my colleagues that someone with such a role in creating the company has the capacity and courage, really, to say, 'We have some challenges, some things to look at.' ""

The case Hughes and academics lay out in their presentation centers around the Sherman Act, the government's primary law for investigating and penalizing anticompetitive practices. Congress adopted the law in 1890 at a time of rapid consolidation in the U.S. that created oil and railroad giants the government later challenged as monopolies.

The law and its later updates prohibit acquiring another company with the main purpose of getting rid of a potential or actual competitor.

Facebook was doing just that when it acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the team's PowerPoint argues. While Instagram was still tiny Zuckerberg identified its explosive growth on mobile phones as the obvious antidote to Facebook's largely desktop product. Mobile was viewed as a clear weakness for Facebook as the company headed into its public offering in 2012.

Hughes' feedback shaped the scholars' case, as he helped them understand how executives in Silicon Valley think about competition -- it tends to be measured by viral growth rather than by size, said Hemphill, the New York University professor. At the time, the two professors were working on a roadshow, which they asked Hughes to join.

While Instagram was tiny, it was growing rapidly. ""That must have been terrifying"" for Facebook, Hemphill said. ""It helps bring home the threat, the observability of the threat and the intensity of it.""

Motivation can be the determining factor when it comes to successfully bringing an antitrust case against a giant corporation, Hemphill said. For example, a memo from CEO Bill Gates suggesting rival Netscape was leading in an ""Internet tidal wave"" became a smoking gun in a case that suggested why the company was protecting its operating system.

The trio also flags Facebook's enormous balance sheet and user base, something that impressed House lawmakers when Hughes presented to them this month.

""The thing that stuck with me. . . was he focused on Facebook's revenue as a true measure of its role in the marketplace,"" recalled Rep. Cicilline. ""Facebook captures over 80 percent of all global social media revenue and controls 58 percent of the U.S. social media market. That's significant.""

Across the Capitol, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn sought out Hughes for a meeting earlier this month to talk privacy and competition. The Republican lawmaker recently launched a special ""task force"" to study those issues and potentially endorse legislative solutions in the coming months.

Blackburn has pitched legislation for years that would limit how tech giants collect and monetize users' data, a bill that Facebook long has opposed through its lobbying organizations. But she said Hughes was ""very familiar"" with it, and during her meeting, encouraged Blackburn in her efforts generally to ""begin to put some guidelines and some guardrails in place.""

Lawmakers and regulators have also held meetings with other antitrust experts, according to those leaders, such as Barry Lynn from the Open Markets Institute, and Gene Kimmelman, a former top DOJ antitrust official who until recently ran Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group that has lobbied for stronger competition enforcement against tech and telecom consolidation.

Hughes spoke to Public Knowledge in June after meeting Kimmelman at an event.

""I think he's extremely interested in this as part of his broader philosophy,"" Kimmelman said. ""He's very concerned with the concentration of wealth and power in society.""

Hughes said that he has not heard from his longtime friend and cofounder Zuckerberg since publishing the oped."

Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images

Compared with some of the other events taking place on Capitol Hill this week, Mark Esper’s confirmation as defense secretary on Tuesday was a largely drama-free affair: Esper, a former lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon, sailed through with a 90–8 vote, ending the longest period without a confirmed secretary in the history of the Defense Department.

Esper is one of three acting secretaries who’ve served since Jim Mattis resigned in December, including Patrick Shanahan, who was initially nominated by President Donald Trump to take on the role permanently but withdrew from consideration in June amid revelations of domestic violence involving his ex-wife and son. At a time when the president is casually talking about killing 10 million people in Afghanistan, it makes sense that Esper was an uncontroversial nominee, but outside the Trumpian context, it’s still regrettable that he didn’t face a little more scrutiny. At this point, senators might have voted for anyone with a pulse to take over the Pentagon. Esper boasts not only a pulse but a résumé that includes fighting in the Army during the first Gulf War, extensive experience in defense policy, and a positively regarded tenure as secretary of the Army. The answers he gave during his written and public testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee reveal very conventional defense establishment—as opposed to Trumpian—views: He believes in the value of U.S. alliances including NATO, views Russia as an adversary, and is wary of hasty troop withdrawals.

But as Edwin Djabatey and Kate Brannen of Just Security note, it’s astonishing that Esper did not face a single question about Afghanistan—America’s longest war—in his confirmation hearing. In his written testimony, he said that the withdrawal of troops from the conflict should be “conditions-based”—but we have very little idea from his testimony what those conditions might be. As Djabatey and Brannen also point out, Esper listed three objectives for the ongoing U.S. military mission in Syria: fighting the remnants of ISIS, reaching a political settlement for the Syrian civil war, and pushing for the withdrawal of Iranian troops from the conflict. The last two objectives were definitely never authorized by Congress. The first arguably isn’t either; U.S. troops were sent to Syria by the Obama administration under the auspices of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, passed before ISIS even existed. (Esper opposes canceling or amending the authorization.)

Esper also supports keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, and keeping active-duty troops on the southern U.S. border.

Then there’s the Raytheon issue. The contractor produces electronics for a wide array of U.S. combat systems. Esper spent seven years as the company’s top lobbyist in Washington. The most contentious moment of Esper’s confirmation hearing on July 16 came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed him on his ties to his former company and refusal to pledge to recuse himself from any decisions affecting Raytheon’s business throughout his tenure in government. Esper said he could not do that based on the advice of department ethics advisers, though he did promise to recuse himself from discussions involving a proposed merger of Raytheon and another company. Warren wasn’t having it, noting that Shanahan had made such a pledge with regard to his former employer, Boeing, and telling Esper, “This smacks of corruption, plain and simple.”

With Esper’s confirmation, four Trump Cabinet departments will be led by former lobbyists. Despite Trump’s executive order requiring officials not to lobby the agencies where they once worked for five years after leaving government, ProPublica reported in February that at least 33 former officials have found their way around the pledge. The swamp is far from drained.

Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe actually apologized to Esper for Warren’s questioning. Sen. Rick Scott joked, “I guess she just needed a moment for her presidential campaign.”

It is true that of the eight Democratic senators who voted against Esper’s confirmation, five—Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar—are running for president. Bernie Sanders did not vote.

Republicans would describe this as campaign grandstanding, but it is notable that none of the senators whose records will face the greatest public scrutiny in the coming year wants a vote for Esper on that record.

The problems with Esper may not rate high on the scale of Trump-era outrages. They’re not even new. Esper and Republican senators pointed out during the hearings that Barack Obama had also named officials with lobbyist backgrounds to senior Pentagon positions, including Deputy Defense Secretary Bill Lynn, another former Raytheon lobbyist. In both his views on military force and his career path, Esper demonstrates problems in Washington—and reasons for public frustration— that predated this administration."
Gay couple sues State Department for denying daughter's citizenship,https://www.cnn.com,"['Rebekah Riess', 'Jay Croft']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/gay-couple-daughter-citizenship-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) A gay married couple in Georgia sued the US State Department on Wednesday for refusing to recognize their daughter as a citizen.

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders.

This pesticide is closely related to nerve agents used in World War II. Trump’s EPA doesn’t care.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joseph G.

Joseph G. Allen is assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and faculty adviser to the Harvard Healthy Building Materials Academy.

Here’s a question: Do you think that a chemical cousin of nerve agents used in World War II that alters the brain function of children should be used as a pesticide? I’d hazard a guess that most people think this is a bad idea. The Trump administration, on the other hand, thinks this is just fine.

What I’m talking about here is the decision from President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency — going against decades of science and its own scientist’s advice —to reject an Obama-era petition to ban the pesticide called chlorpyrifos.

What we know about chlorpyrifos is alarming. Perhaps the most well-known study is one done by researchers at Columbia University who performed brain imaging on young kids with high exposure to chlorpyrifos. The results are shocking and unambiguous. In the words of the researchers: “This study reports significant associations of prenatal exposure to a widely used environmental neurotoxicant, at standard use levels, with structural changes in the developing human brain.”

Yes, you read that right. The pesticide the Trump administration wants to continue to use interferes with childhood brain development. Trump’s EPA assured the public in a statement that “there is good reason” to continue allowing farmers to use the chemical, arguing that “critical questions remained” regarding its harmful effects. Let’s explore the science.

Chlorpyrifos operates by targeting the nervous system of living animals. Here’s how it works: When a nerve cell in our body is stimulated and wants to pass that message to an adjacent nerve cell, it needs a means to pass that message along. Nerve cells do this by releasing a small amount of acetylcholine (ACH) at their terminal end so that adjacent nerve cells can pick up that signal and pass that message along. The receptors on the adjacent nerve cell detect the ACH, which triggers them to “fire,” and the cascade continues, thereby transmitting the signal throughout the brain and body. For that reason, ACH is what is called a neurotransmitter.

The ACH released into the synapse between nerve cells has to be cleaned up quickly so the nerve cells can fire again. Our bodies do this with an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE), that breaks down ACH in less than a millisecond, thus resetting the system.

Here’s where chlorpyrifos comes in. Chlorpyrifos specifically targets this AChE enzyme, thereby preventing the ACH from getting cleared up at the synapse. The result, as you might expect, is an overstimulated nervous system. High levels of chlorpyrifos can cause dizziness, confusion and death. At low levels, it impacts cognitive function — and brain development.

Chlorpyrifos also crosses the placenta.

In this light, the results from the Columbia study make sense and may even be intuitive. Disrupting the finely tuned symphony of messages in our body necessary for normal brain development can lead to changes in brain structure and function.

Other studies have shown harmful effects on kids, too. Chlorpyrifos is associated with reduced IQ and working memory among children as well as delays in psychomotor development. In another study, chlorpyrifos exposure was associated with autism spectrum disorder. In that study of nearly 1,000 pregnancies, proximity to agricultural lands that used chlorpyrifos during the second trimester was associated with a threefold greater likelihood of having a child with ASD.

Of course, it’s not only humans who are at risk here. Chlorpyrifos acts on the same biological pathways in other living species. The National Institutes of Health has labeled chlorpyrifos as “toxic” to birds and “extremely toxic” to fish and bees.

We’ve known this science for a long time now. In fact, chlorpyrifos was banned for use in homes almost 20 years ago in the George W. Bush administration because of concerns over toxicity. The Obama administration followed that with proposing a complete ban in 2015. EPA scientists in 2016 reported that, “expected residues of chlorpyrifos on food crops exceed the safety standard” and “the majority of estimated drinking water exposure from currently registered uses, including water exposure from non-food uses, continues to exceed safe levels.” Now, the Trump administration is denying that ban.

Let’s cut right to the chase: A war on health is underway, and it is being waged through attacks on the environment. To date, the Trump administration has reported more than 80 rollbacks of environmental protections.

Even more disturbing, Trump’s war on health is targeting children. Just a few months ago, his administration announced that it was cutting funding to the Children’s Environmental Health research centers, the flagship institutions around the country that focus on studying how kids are impacted by environmental hazards. In fact, one of these centers at Columbia University produced the landmark research showing that chlorpyrifos altered children’s brains.

One has to wonder: Was the cutting of federal research funds all part of a bigger plan in Trump’s war on kids' health? Consider that Trump’s inauguration fund accepted a $1 million donation from the maker of chlorpyrifos, Dow Chemical Company. The Trump administration also appointed then-Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris to head a White House manufacturing working group, which supported an executive order that mandated the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations.

Shortly thereafter, the EPA announced its intent to deny the chlorpyrifos ban proposal, a decision that Dow supported, unsurprisingly. Today, the toxic chemical has been unleashed, and the pesky scientists warning about it are defunded.

Now ask yourself: Who stands to benefit from this approach? I have the answer: It’s not our kids.

Justice Department refuses to charge William Barr and Wilbur Ross over House contempt vote,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-refuses-to-charge-william-barr-and-wilbur-ross-over-house-contempt-vote,"The Department of Justice has declined to prosecute Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The decision comes after Barr and Ross refused to submit documents requested by congressional subpoenas related to the Trump administration's attempts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The House then voted 230-198 to hold both Cabinet officials in contempt of Congress.

""The Department of Justice’s long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

Rosen said the pair's decision to not comply with the subpoenas ""did not constitute a crime."" The DOJ had not been expected to prosecute either Barr or Ross for contempt.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee issued the subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April seeking information about why the president wanted to add the citizenship question to the census. When both Cabinet officials declined to respond to the subpoenas, Trump asserted executive privilege and ordered Barr and Ross not to hand over documents related to the investigation.

Rosen cited prior Justice Department cases to justify his decision not to prosecute the Cabinet officials, including investigations into both the Bush and Obama administrations.

""[A]ccordingly the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general or the secretary,"" Rosen said.

Trump has been accused by opponents of the citizenship question of attempting to deter both legal and undocumented immigrants from engaging in the census. The Supreme Court ended up blocking the Trump administration from adding the question to the census last month."
DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"
US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Voices New Pessimism About Bitcoin’s Future,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Bitcoins', 'Ivan Franciscovich', 'Real John Smith', 'Jim Bone', 'Brewdog Paradox', 'John Smith', 'Tom Gilchrist']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-voices-new-pessimism-about-bitcoins-future,"United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced new bearish views on Bitcoin today, saying that he probably will not be talking about the number one cryptocurrency in as soon as five years. In an interview with Squawk Box CNBC on July 24, Mnuchin said:

“I won’t be talking about Bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that […] I would bet even in 5 or 6 years I’m no longer talking about Bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I’ll have other priorities […] I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on Bitcoin.”

Mnuchin’s latest remarks follow a recent statement about how cryptocurrencies primarily exist as a vehicle for crime and speculative investment, saying, “I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

However, CEO and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert celebrated the Treasury Secretary’s remarks, saying that they were “complete and total validation of Bitcoin.”

Money Laundering

Mnuchin also recently claimed that fiat money is not laundered to the extent that Bitcoin is. In a separate Squawk Box interview, Mnuchin said that the U.S. has the strongest Anti-Money Laundering system in the world. Bitcoin, on the other hand, he believes is vulnerable to money laundering.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, economist and anti-cryptocurrency pundit Nouriel Roubini recently wrote an essay with high criticism of the crypto exchange BitMEX, implying that the exchange knowingly launders money for terrorists and criminals:"
DOJ Opens Antitrust Probe of Big Tech,https://patriotpost.us,[],,,,https://patriotpost.us/articles/64487-doj-opens-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech,"On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that it is opening an antitrust probe into America’s biggest tech companies. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, explained that the broad and sweeping investigation would seek to determine whether tech giants have engaged in monopolistic practices that have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.” This latest DOJ probe is now the second investigation launched by the government into Big Tech, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently conducting a smaller investigation into potential abuses by Facebook and Amazon.

Back in January, Attorney General William Barr expressed concerns over Big Tech’s rapid growth when he told lawmakers, “I don’t think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers. You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.” It now appears that Barr is seeking to answer these questions.

Criticism of Big Tech has become a uniquely bipartisan issue in this era of heightened partisanship. However, the reasoning behind that criticism is not uniform. Conservatives accuse Big Tech of free-speech infringement specifically related to the censorship practices against conservative social-media figures. Leftists like anti-corporate socialist Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), on the other hand, call for tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up simply for being too big.

News of the DOJ’s new antitrust probe sent shares of the four top tech companies down, as Apple, Alphabet Inc. (Google’s and YouTube’s parent company), Amazon, and Facebook combined to lose an estimated $33 billion in premarket trading Wednesday morning. As Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives observed, this investigation is a “shot across the bow.”"
Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454805-interior-whistleblowers-say-agency-has-sidelined-scientists-under,"Former Interior Department employees who say they experienced retaliation at the agency for their work on scientific endeavors appeared before lawmakers Thursday, sparking political wrangling over the role of scientists in the Trump administration.

Republicans used the appearances to accuse Democrats of political theater, while Democrats in turn stepped up calls for scientists to be protected.

Among those testifying were Joel Clement, a whistleblower who said he was removed from his work on climate change and reassigned to an accounting role.

Also testifying was Maria Caffrey, who said she had to fight with the Interior Department to keep references to the human contributions to climate change in a report on how sea level rise would impact national parks.

Clement said under the Trump administration, the Interior Department “has sidelined scientists and experts, flattened the morale of the career staff, and by all accounts, is bent on hollowing out the Agency.”

Clement, now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said he was removed from his work with 30 Alaska Native communities that were “one big storm away from being wiped right off the map” and needed to be immediately relocated.

Caffrey, whose research was funded by the Interior Department, said she found herself repeatedly demoted at the agency after pushing to keep references to the human impacts of climate change in her report.

“It removes the meaning from my study. I prepared four different climate scenarios for those three different time periods, so those scenarios hang on how much greenhouse gases we produce in the future,” she said, including how much humans contribute to the atmosphere.

“I had become at outcast for standing up,” she added, noting the department told her they didn’t want her help even on a volunteer basis. She is now looking for work in the Denver area.

The hearing was to discuss the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoAutomakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California Overnight Energy: House Democrats offer rival to Green New Deal | Zinke clients include industries he regulated | Oil companies dealt blow in Rhode Island climate lawsuit House Democrats announce climate plan to rival Green New Deal with 2050 goal MORE (D-N.Y.) that would add protections for government scientists, including allowing them to publish research outside of government channels and establish a Scientific Integrity Officer.

Several Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee complained the hearing was political theater centered around a bill that would have to pass out of the committee.

They said there were more complaints about misuse of science under the Obama administration.

“In listening to some of our panelists today you would think that the Trump administration was the only one where there have been issues regarding scientific integrity, and that certainly is not the case,” said Rep. Jody Hice Jody Brownlow HiceThe 27 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block Trump from taking military action against Iran Conservatives ask Barr to lay out Trump's rationale for census question GOP moves to block provision banning use of Defense funds for border wall MORE (R-Ga.).

Tonko said such instances should only strengthen their interest in joining their bill.

“If you believe in science and scientific integrity we should have learned from that past and not look for a reason not to do this,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that ""it’s no secret that the Trump administration is not a fan of science.”

“There are the stories that career scientists at Interior are too afraid to share. And with good reason. They have seen their colleagues, like our witnesses, get threatened, harassed, reassigned, and retaliated against,” he added.

Scientists have been vocal about what they view as mistreatment under the Trump administration.

They have cited examples, ranging from limiting government-funded scientists from sitting on an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) board to a proposal to limit what kind of studies can be considered by the EPA, to recent plans to relocate U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers and Bureau of Land Management policymakers.

“To purge the language of climate change from the agency entirely is a direct assault on the science we know is very prominent and very clear on the risk to the mission of the agency that we act now to protect real people in harm’s way,” Clement said.

Interior was invited to attend the hearing but did not send a representative.

""The Department of the Interior diligently works to accommodate Congressional invitations to testify,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill, saying it had participated in 59 of 62 Congressional legislative and oversight hearings that the Department has been invited to, or 95 percent, and provided over 65 witnesses for Committees."""

Déjà vu: Mueller again causes confusion on his reason for not charging Trump,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deja-vu-mueller-again-causes-confusion-on-his-reason-for-not-charging-trump,"Robert Mueller caused confusion during his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee as he appeared to contradict Attorney General William Barr, as well as declined to stand by a previous official statement from his own special counsel’s office, related to the decision-making behind not charging President Trump with any crimes.

Mueller’s report did not reach a determination on obstruction of justice in his 448-page report, although he laid out 10 possible instances of obstruction. Mueller’s report referenced a longtime Office of Legal Counsel opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but his report did not explicitly claim that that was the only reason Trump wasn’t charged in the investigation. Moreover, Barr said in April that Mueller told him that Mueller was not saying that he would have charged Trump with a crime but for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and, in addition, a joint statement from the offices of Mueller and Barr in May reiterated that point.

But Wednesday, Mueller appeared to reverse course, appearing to say that he would have charged Trump with a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California asked, “I’d like to ask you the reason, again, you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?”

“That is correct,” Mueller said.

Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona pressed him on this, saying “that is not what you said in the report and that is not what you told Attorney General Barr.” Lesko also pointed to the joint statement he put out earlier this year, saying there was no daylight between himself and Barr on that issue. She quoted from that statement, reading, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice.”

“So, Mr. Mueller, do you stand by your joint statement that you issued on May 29th as you sit here today?” Lesko asked.

Mueller declined to stand by the official statement from his own office from less than two months ago.

“I would have to look at it more closely before I said I agree with it,” Mueller said.

“My conclusion is that what you told Mr. Lieu really contradicts what you said in the report and what you said apparently repeatedly to Attorney General Barr,” Lesko replied. “And then you issued a joint statement on May 29.”

Lesko was referencing a nearly identical controversy which took place following Mueller’s press conference in late May. “The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,"" Mueller said at that time. ""The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation.""

After Mueller's roughly nine-minute statement, politicians, pundits, and journalists interpreted Mueller’s remarks as a clear break from what Barr stated, suggesting that Mueller was saying that the only reason he didn’t charge Trump was the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

But Barr said in April that he and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Mueller in early March and that they “specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion.”

“And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position,” Barr said in April. “He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime.”

Barr and Rosenstein concluded that obstruction had not occurred.

After the May press conference, the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel put on a united front that was intended to end speculation that Mueller contradicted Barr on the decision-making on whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice during his public address.

“The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements,"" a joint statement from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec and Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said at the time.

Before the joint statement came out, Mueller's office released a handout comparing his assertions about obstruction of justice to what Barr said about it. The document, which apparently sought to provide context, contained quotes from Barr's press conference before the release of Mueller's report in which he said Mueller repeatedly assured him that he did not think they would have found a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion."
Amazon ‘destroyed the retail industry across the US’ says Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708398/amazon-destroyed-retail-industry-mnuchin-us-treasury-secretary,"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Amazon “destroyed the retail industry across the United States” and that it’s appropriate for the attorney general to investigate the company alongside other tech giants in the sweeping antitrust review that the Justice Department announced yesterday. “There’s no question they’ve limited competition,” Mnuchin told CNBC’s Squawk Box.

Mnuchin said that “although there’s certain benefits” to Amazon’s success, the company has “really hurt small businesses” in the process. “I think it’s absolutely right that the attorney general is looking into these issues,” he said this morning.

The Justice Department said yesterday that it would begin a review into whether major online platforms have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.” While Amazon was not mentioned by name, the assumption is that the DOJ will be looking at it alongside other tech giants, like Facebook and Google, that also vastly dominate their fields.

Amazon responded to Mnuchin’s remarks with a comment saying that its platform helps small businesses and that physical stores still dominate retail sales. “Small and medium-sized businesses are thriving with Amazon,” a spokesperson said. They said that Amazon represents “less than 4 percent of US retail,” and that 90 percent of retail sales “still occur in brick-and-mortar stores according to the US Census Bureau.”

Mnuchin’s feelings on Amazon won’t make a difference as far as the review is concerned — the Treasury Department isn’t involved — but his comments speak to the way public opinion has quickly changed on tech giants’ dominance, as well as the way that opinion has taken hold in the Trump administration. President Trump has long taken issue with Amazon and its CEO. Last year, speaking to the dominance of Amazon, Facebook, and Google, he said that “many people think it is a very antitrust situation.”

The Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown on Nigeria is targeting high-powered politicians,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1674848/trump-us-state-dept-issues-travel-ban-on-nigerian-politicians/,"Ahead of Nigeria’s general elections back in February, the United States government said it would consider placing visa restrictions on individuals who undermine the process or are involved in organizing electoral violence.

Earlier this week, it made good on its promise and issued visa restrictions on Nigerians who, it says, “operated with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people and undermined democratic principles and human rights.” Despite email inquiries from Quartz, the US State Department did not name the banned individuals or state how many politicians are affected.

One reason for that, says Matthew Page, a Chatham House fellow and former US State Department official: “The US doesn’t name and shame because visa information is covered by privacy regulations and thus confidential.” The uncertainty around “who or what type of person was targeted or how many” could also see bad actors continue to fear they are at risk, he adds.

While unconfirmed, it’s likely the visa restrictions have been issued to high-level politicians who typically have enough power and access to resources to possibly “undermine” elections or co-ordinate violence.

The restrictions come after elections which were marred by sporadic violence across several parts of the country: according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based geopolitical intelligence firm, over 600 (pdf) people were killed during the last election season. YIAGA Africa, a coalition of election observers, also described the polls as a missed opportunity for Nigeria’s electoral commission to improve the quality of elections.

On the face of it, a US visa ban does not serve as much of a deterrent for errant politicians who will retain the ability to travel elsewhere or simply choose to remain in Nigeria. But such bans, even when not publicly confirmed, are often politicized as indictments on a politician’s transparency record by opponents. One of the more prominent examples is former vice president and 2019 presidential aspirant Atiku Abubakar who has long struggled to shake off talk of being subjected to visa restrictions by the United States over bribery scandals.

While there is some uncertainty as to the visa bans for politicians, the Trump administration has been explicit about its other clampdown measures on visas for Nigerians: it indefinitely suspended an interview waiver program for Nigerian applicants in May.

Even though the US State Department emphasized the actions are “specific to certain individuals and not directed at the Nigerian people or the newly elected government,” it is likely to further unsettle Nigerians interested in applying for US visas and likely spark more speculation.

"Sprint, T-Mobile merger: DOJ reportedly in talks with states for support",https://www.cnet.com,['Corinne Reichert'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sprint-t-mobile-merger-doj-reportedly-in-talks-with-states-for-support/,"Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly in talks with states to gain their support for the Sprint merger with T-Mobile. The talks include attorneys general of states that didn't join the antitrust lawsuit to block the merger last month, The Wall Street Journal said citing sources.

Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a group of 10 state attorneys general in June sued to block the two carriers from merging.

Also joining were attorneys general from Colorado, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Connecticut, Virginia and Wisconsin, who said the transaction would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services.""

T-Mobile and Sprint are nearing a sale of assets expected to include the Boost Mobile prepaid wireless service and wireless spectrum in a move to gain regulatory approval for their $26.5 billion merger. Satellite TV provider Dish is believed to be the frontrunner in the $6 billion asset acquisition, with the deal rumored to be announced this week.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai green-lighted the merger in May, on the condition that T-Mobile and Sprint divested Boost Mobile as well as requiring them to build out 5G in rural areas and offer wireless home broadband good enough to substitute fixed line service.

However, a May Bloomberg report said the DOJ wants T-Mobile and Sprint to form a new wireless carrier. The merger would reduce the number of major carriers from four to three, with Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim wanting four carriers to remain for more competition, according to Bloomberg.

Sprint declined to comment. T-Mobile and the DOJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."
Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

""I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin"" in 10 years, says Treasury Secretary Mnuchin #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/0J5acWQwRO — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) July 24, 2019

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

The Justice Department’s antitrust investigation is cause for caution,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-justice-departments-antitrust-investigation-is-cause-for-caution/2019/07/24/0ae8725e-ae43-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html,"BIG TECH, meet Big Brother.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday a broad-based antitrust review of “the practices of market-leading online platforms,” without naming any names — and without explaining exactly what practices officials believe could be anti-competitive. The country is still catching up to a new era in which a handful of Internet companies have substantial power over Americans’ daily lives, and that power is worth examining. But the scope and circumstances of the investigation announced this week are cause for caution.

Increased interest across the government in scrutinizing top tech firms’ market behavior signals the erosion of the argument that platforms providing free services cannot possibly run afoul of authorities. Some critics believe industry giants are unfairly leveraging their dominance to bury rivals on the Web where Americans cannot see them or sucking up their data to drive them out of the game. Others think so much control resting with so few is itself a problem. President Trump and his allies, however, have seized on a highly specific grievance: Silicon Valley is too liberal, and its leaders are censoring conservatives online.

There is no evidence to support claims of censorship, yet conservatives have turned multiple oversight hearings into circuses full of rhetorical acrobatics and accusations. Only this month, Mr. Trump convened a “social media summit” similarly designed to bully companies for not behaving the way he wants. Last week, he promised to “take a look” at Google after allegations that the company was committing treason by working with the Chinese government. And in June, he explicitly connected Facebook, Google and Amazon to his electoral prospects. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.) “The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies,” he told CNBC. “They were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, ‘If you don’t have them, you can’t win.’ Well, I won. And I’ll win again.”

It is wishful to think that an increasingly political Justice Department operates independent of these pressures. We already know the president reportedly sought to push authorities to block a major media merger because of his animosity toward CNN. And last September, officials said outright that a meeting with state attorneys general about antitrust would revolve around concerns that companies were “intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms” — giving the lie to the argument that enthusiasm for a probe is untethered from the president’s perennial personal gripes.

Antitrust investigations should be targeted to particular practices by particular companies that hurt consumers or impede competition. They should not be a cudgel brandished against an entire industry for a vague set of violations that could well include having Democratic employees and leaders. Antitrust advocates worried about the concentration of power in one place should take care not to champion an even more dangerous accumulation in another."
A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia faces conflict of interest problem in labor lawyer brother,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/labor-secretary-nominee-eugene-scalia-faces-conflict-of-interest-problem-in-labor-lawyer-brother,"Labor secretary nominee Eugene Scalia may be obligated to recuse himself from some agency litigation, ethics experts say, because his younger brother John is a high-profile management-side lawyer involved in cases before the agency.

The situation would be an unusual one, because it doesn't involve a financial conflict of interest, just a familial one, and it is not clear how it will be addressed by the administration.

Family ties can create tricky situations for officials regardless of how they handle them. For example, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts slammed then-Securities and Exchange Committee Chairwoman Mary Jo White in 2015 for recusing herself from SEC cases in which her husband was a litigator, arguing her recusals disrupted the SEC by stalling prosecutions.

President Trump last week tapped the elder brother, Eugene, 55, to replace the departing labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, who stepped down following criticism of his 2008 prosecution as a U.S. attorney of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Scalia has worked with the private sector management-side firm Gibson Dunn, where he has led its Labor and Employment Practice Group for the past 12 years.

John, the second-oldest son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is a shareholder at the firm GreenbergTraurig, where he also practices labor law. According to John's bio on the firm's website, ""He practices regularly in federal and state courts, in private mediation and arbitration proceedings, and before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and equivalent state administrative agencies.""

In a 2008 case, for example, John Scalia defended a company, L-3 Services, when the Department of Labor, then headed by now-Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, alleged it violated overtime rules. It eventually agreed to pay $700,000 in backpay to victims. In a 2015 case, he defended the chief operating officer of a company, Chimes DC, alleged to have violated fiduciary duties. A district court threw out the charges against his client late last year.

The Scalia brothers' overlapping business is a potential problem, said Wilma Liebman, former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board, a separate federal agency that enforces labor laws.

""Surely Eugene’s involvement as secretary in any matter in which his brother John is involved would scream conflict of interest, or at least appearance of conflict — equally critical. I would think that he would have to recuse himself from any involvement in such a case,"" said Liebman, now a senior research associate at Harvard Law School's labor and worklife program.

It doesn't matter if the elder brother isn't directly involved in any litigation, she said. ""I don’t think the department head is sufficiently removed from litigation that it does not matter. For one, litigation brought by or against the department is in the name of the secretary,"" she said.

The proper course of action, said Scott Amey, chief counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group, would be for Scalia ""to be recused from handling or participating in any cases that would involve his brother or possibly even his brother's firm, just make sure there isn't even an appearance of a conflict of interest."" All matters regarding the litigation would have to be handled the next in line at the department, the deputy secretary. That would likely be Patrick Pizzella, who is the department's acting secretary until the Senate confirms a new head of the cabinet agency.

Amey said that, in the Scalias' case, Eugene would also need to ensure that there is no ""trickle down effect"" where cases brought by his brother's firm receive preferential treatment by people in the department who think it might win favor with the department head. What complicates the situation, Amey noted, is that most ethics rules are written to prevent financial conflicts of interest. Family connections don't necessarily involve such financial ties, but can still represent a potential conflict. There is little precedent for addressing the possible conflicts, according to Amey and others contacted by the Washington Examiner.

The elder Scalia will likely address the matter in an agreement made with the Office of Government Ethics, said an individual with knowledge of the process. All nominees for a cabinet-level position must make such an agreement, which is then reviewed and agreed upon by the cabinet agency’s chief ethics official and OGE. The agreement outlines any conflicts and how they will be addressed. It is posted publicly.

""We are mindful of ethical obligations and it is our duty to comply with them. In the event where an attorney would need to appear before a family member we would adhere to all applicable ethical guidelines,"" a spokesman for Greenberg Taurig told the Washington Examiner.

The White House has not said whether Scalia has submitted anything to OGE, though Amey noted it is still early in the nomination process. The White House and Labor Department declined to comment.

Kansan is 3rd on the list as Justice Dept. resumes first executions since 2003,https://www.wibw.com,"['Nick Viviani', 'Michael Balsamo']",,,,https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Kansas-man-is-3rd-on-the-list-as-Justice-Dept-resumes-first-executions-since-2003-513198431.html,"A Kansan is slated to be among the first people put to death after the Dept. of Justice says it will begin carrying out executions of death row inmates for the first time since 2003.

In making the announcement Thursday, the agency listed five inmates who are scheduled to be executed starting in December.

The third person on that list, Wesley Ira Purkey, was convicted of raping and murdering a teenage girl at his Lansing home in January 1998. His execution date is set for December 13.

According to prosecutors, Purkey went to Kansas City, Missouri, on January 22, 1998, for a job interview. Afterwards, he smoked crack and began driving around when he spotted 16-year-old Jennifer Long. Luring her into his truck and refusing to let her go, Purkey drove back to his home where he raped he,r then stabbed her repeatedly until his blade broke. Over the next several days, he dismembered, burned, and dumped Long's body into a septic tank.

He was convicted of kidnapping a child, resulting in the child's death on November 5, 2003, and sentenced to die.

Separately, Purkey has been convicted of using a claw hammer to bludgeon to death a 80-year-old woman who suffered from polio and walked with a cane, the Justice Dept. pointed out.

The DOJ noted that Purkey, like all of the other inmates who have had their execution dates scheduled, have exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies. They do not foresee any impediments to stop the executions.

In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, then-President Barack Obama directed the department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs. It remains unclear today what came of that review and whether it will change the way the federal government carries out executions.

That review has been completed and the executions can continue, the department said.

Executions on the federal level have been rare. The government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988, the most recent of which occurred in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a news release. ""The Justice Department upholds the rule of law and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.""

Capital punishment has emerged as a flashpoint in the Democratic presidential primary, with former Vice President Joe Biden this week shifting to call for the elimination of the federal death penalty after years of supporting it. Biden's criminal justice plan also would encourage states to follow the federal government in ending the death penalty, 25 years after he helped pass a tough crime bill that expanded capital punishment for more potential offenses.

The lone Democratic White House hopeful who has publicly supported preserving capital punishment in certain circumstances is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who has said he would leave it open as an option for major crimes such as terrorism.

Investing.com - rose above the key $10,000 level on Thursday in Asia even after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced new pessimism about Bitcoin’s futures.

Bitcoin rose 4.9% to $10,145.8 by 11:48 PM ET (03:48 GMT).

The gains came even after Mnuchin said he thinks the outlook for the crypto king is bleak.

“I won’t be talking about Bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that … I would bet even in 5 or 6 years I’m no longer talking about Bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I’ll have other priorities … I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on Bitcoin,” Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview.

“I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation,” he added.

Regulators around the world have expressed concerns about Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project over privacy and security.

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said at an academic conference last week that the possible illegal activities and instability brought by cryptocurrencies are changing the U.S. currency system, while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that Facebook’s plans for its cryptocurrency Libra “cannot go forward” until serious concerns are addressed.

G-7 finance ministers and U.S. President Donald Trump also warned against Libra this month.

Prices of other major cryptocurrencies also gained today despite the negative sentiment surrounding Facebook’s proposed coin. rose 7.3% to $220.20, climbed 4.0% to 0.31899. surged 7.1% to $95.284."
Facebook and Other Big Tech Stocks Are Barely Moving on the DoJ’s New Probe. Here’s Why.,https://www.barrons.com,['Eric J. Savitz'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/doj-investigation-tech-stocks-51563989279,"Text size

Large-cap tech shares are mostly shrugging off the news that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review “the practices of market-leading online platforms.” Indeed, today’s news is brimming with reports on regulatory actions against tech businesses—but the real market moving news on tech this week will be financial.

Facebook (ticker: FB) reports earnings Wednesday; Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report Thursday. On Tuesday, Snap (SNAP) reported huge user growth, and the stock is on fire. Investors don’t believe that Washington’s investigations will have a material impact on big tech’s financial results, so they are largely ignoring them for now.

It’s a busy day on the regulatory front, even aside from the DoJ story.

Facebook (FB) reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to pay a $5 billion fine over the company’s data privacy practices. In announcing the penalty, the FTC said the agreement also “requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.”

Facebook said the agreement “provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.”

But Democrats on the Commission observed that the penalties were more or less meaningless in the larger scheme of things—something investors had already figured out.

“The proposed settlement does little to change [Facebook’s] business model or practices,” writes Commissioner Rohit Chopra in a dissenting opinion. “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.”

Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter writes in her own dissent that in the interest of shedding a spotlight on Facebook’s behavior, the FTC should have litigated the matter. “The Commission would better serve the public interest and be more likely to effectively change Facebook by fighting for the right outcome in a public court of law,” she writes.

Meanwhile, Facebook yesterday also reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a $100 million fine “for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of Facebook user data,” a case tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (On Wednesday, Netflix happened to unveil a new documentary on Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica story called The Great Hack.)

Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple (APPL) appears to be favoring its own apps in App Store searches. The Journal writes that “the company’s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for ‘maps,’ the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps.”

While the DoJ announcement Tuesday didn’t name names, there’s little mystery about which companies the government has in mind.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the government said in a press release.

“The goal of the Department’s review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.”

The language suggests they are going after four of the world’s largest companies by market cap—Alphabet’s Google unit dominates search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon.com is synonymous with online retail. Apple likely falls under the online retail rubric, as well, given its dominant App Store platform.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on the DoJ announcement directly, and instead pointed to testimony last week by Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, during a House subcommittee hearing on online platforms. “In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,” he said. “We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals. We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”

Apple declined to comment on the DoJ announcement, while Facebook and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft (MSFT), largely a cloud play now and the world’s most valuable public company, was once the government’s favorite tech target. It appears to have avoided the investigators this time around.

It’s not entirely clear how the DoJ announcement relates to previous news that the FTC and the Justice Department had agreed to divvy up their investigatory responsibilities, with Justice taking on Apple and Google, and the FTC focusing on Amazon and Facebook. But the overall intent seems the same—to curb the behavior of tech giants.

So how is this likely to play out?

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Wednesday that any push to break up the companies is likely to fail. Current antitrust law is intended to protect consumers against predatory pricing, not punish companies for being big and successful.

In the cases of Google and Facebook, the companies don’t charge for their primary products—so there’s no pricing, let alone predatory pricing. To assess the market effect of the companies on other measures isn’t impossible, but, Ives notes, it would likely require changes in antitrust law, and in the current political mood in Washington, that seems “exceedingly unlikely.”

Legislation could have a more immediate impact, though, particularly the pending California Consumer Privacy Act, which Barron’srecently covered. The law goes into effect in January and is intended to force changes in the way companies collect and sell personal information. For Google and Facebook, and increasingly for Apple and Amazon, the ability to sell targeted ads is of huge value. Federal legislation to do the same could be the route to real change in the tech business, with a higher probability of success than antitrust enforcement.

Ives predicts that Congress and the DoJ will investigate, and find “no harm, no foul.” He thinks investors should buy all of the big four stocks on any weakness relating to the investigations.

In afternoon trading, Facebook is down 0.4% to $201.51; Alphabet is down 1.2%, to $1,134.75; Apple is down 0.4%, to $208.03; and Amazon is 0.3%, to $1988.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%.

"After Trump’s DOJ instructed Mueller not to answer questions, House GOP attacks him for complying",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-doj-instructed-mueller-not-to-answer-questions-house-gop-attacks-him-c5a231353ab7/,"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department wrote to former special counsel Robert Mueller this week, instructing him to limit his congressional testimony to what was in his report. On Wednesday, House Republicans openly attacked him for doing just that.

“Any testimony must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege, including information protected by law enforcement, deliberative process, attorney work product, and presidential communications privileges,” Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer instructed Mueller in his letter. “These privileges would include discussion about investigative steps or decisions made during your investigation not otherwise described in the public version of your report.”

In his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday, Mueller answered questions cautiously, frequently declining to respond to queries that strayed from those boundaries and referring committee members to the written report.

But Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tweeted out an attack on Mueller during the hearing, calling it “remarkable” that “Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information.”

This is remarkable. Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information, and admitted he denied exoneration of Trump over a standard that doesn’t exist. No one needs to discredit this process. Team Mueller and House Democrats are discrediting it by themselves. — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) July 24, 2019

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) tweeted Meadows’ smear.

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ) also joined in, accusing him of “having trouble answering basic questions.”

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) accused Mueller of being “intellectually disheveled.”

“He seemed to not have a strong command of the facts and he seemed unwilling to answer basic questions the American people want to know,” he told the Miami Herald.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) complained in a tweet that “Mueller said he won’t answer any questions about what started the false accusation that the President conspired with Russia.”

It does not appear any of these lawmakers has publicly objected to the Justice Department’s letter restricting Mueller’s answers.

Readers respond: A thank you to the VA,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Letters To', 'Editorial.Oped Oregonian.Com', 'Letters To The Editor']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2019/07/readers-respond-a-thank-you-to-the-va.html,"I would like to thank the Portland Veterans Administration Hospital and its staff. My husband spent a week there and received wonderful care. What we appreciated most was the staff: doctors, nurses, techs, maintenance people and office personnel. They were all courteous, kind, friendly and respectful. The VA’s customer service training, “I care core values,” should be a model for other businesses (Starbucks, for example). Also, thank you, President Trump and the new Department of Veterans Affairs. Attitudes about veterans sure have changed since the ’60s, when misdirected war protesters disparaged my husband after he returned from serving in the infantry in Vietnam. I am now seeing similar misdirected anger and mistreatment of our police. The military serves our country. Our police serve our community. Both should receive respect.
