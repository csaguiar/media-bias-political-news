Trump’s Rollback of Auto Pollution Rules Shows Signs of Disarray,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Coral Davenport', 'Hiroko Tabuchi']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/climate/trump-auto-emissions-rollback-disarray.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The White House, blindsided by a pact between California and four automakers to oppose President Trump’s auto emissions rollbacks, has mounted an effort to prevent any more companies from joining the other side.

Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors were all summoned by a senior Trump adviser to a White House meeting last month where he pressed them to stand by the president’s own initiative , according to four people familiar with the talks.

But even as the White House was working to do this, it was losing ground. Yet another company, Mercedes-Benz, is preparing to join the four automakers already in the California agreement — Honda, Ford, Volkswagen and BMW — according to two people familiar with the German company’s plans.

Mr. Trump, described by three people as enraged by California’s deal, has demanded that his staff members step up the pace to complete his plan. His proposal, however, is directly at odds with the wishes of many automakers, which fear that the aggressive rollbacks will spark a legal battle between California and the federal government that could split the United States car market."

In a final scene of the Netflix documentary “American Factory,” the chairman of a Chinese auto glass company walks through the sprawling floor of one of the company’s factories in Dayton, Ohio, as an aide points to different departments where employees will soon be replaced by robotic arms and other machines.

“We’re hoping to cancel four workers in July or August,” the aide tells him, almost proudly, before adding, “They are too slow.”

Scenes like this are typical in the film, which depicts the fallout after Shanghai-based Fuyao Glass revives a former GM plant and hires many of its former American workers. The employees are at first excited to find new jobs, but soon find themselves struggling to swallow a fraction of their former pay, difficult working conditions and the prospect that, no longer protected by a union, they could be fired at any moment.

The documentary, which debuts on Netflix on August 21, never mentions President Donald Trump by name—but its message is clear: Trump’s promise to reinvigorate the industrial heartland is going to take a lot more than a campaign slogan. There are no easy solutions. And if some manufacturing jobs do come back, they’re going to look nothing like they used to. Americans will have to accept a new reality to stay competitive in the global marketplace—one that they might not like, and one that Trump doesn’t acknowledge.

This message is also coming straight from Barack and Michelle Obama. “American Factory” is the first project to come from the Obamas’ production company, Higher Ground, as part of the deal they made with Netflix to produce a slate of series, movies and documentaries that reflect their values. Higher Ground acquired the movie after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival.

The Obamas have largely kept a low profile as the 2020 presidential race heats up. The former president reportedly has met with a number of Democratic contenders, and has criticized divisive rhetoric “from our leaders” without mentioning Trump by name. But this film is a statement all on its own. Even though the Obamas have avoided overtly partisan material for their Netflix slate (other projects include a biopic of Frederick Douglass and a preschool series called ""Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents”), “American Factory” hits right at a central issue of the last presidential election—and likely the next one.

Reviving American manufacturing is also an issue that Obama has tried to tackle before. His stimulus package pumped billions into green manufacturing projects. And his reelection campaign in 2012 leaned heavily on the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, saving auto manufacturing and related jobs across the industrial Midwest. The results of Obama’s efforts, though, were mixed. His administration touted the growth of the wind and solar industries, but overall job gains are unclear. While the manufacturing sector turned around following a precipitous dive during the Great Recession, the growth was slow and steady, and never not quite returned to where it was when he first took office. Now, not only is Obama watching Trump reverse much of his green economy agenda through deregulation, he’s also watching Trump claim to know how to produce the manufacturing boom that eluded him.



***

Since he announced his run for president in June 2015, Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign centered on his promise to revive manufacturing in areas of the industrial Midwest that had been wiped out by globalization. “We can turn it all around,” he said in one June 2016 speech, “and we can turn it around fast.” Today, Trump is campaigning for reelection heavily in the industrial Midwest, touting a strong record. He told a crowd in Lima, Ohio, earlier this year that when it comes to manufacturing, “We’re bringing it back in record numbers.”

The reality isn’t so rosy. U.S. factory job growth has accelerated since Trump took office. But growth has slowed this year and U.S. manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent in July amid Trump’s trade spat with China. Moreover, a recent study by Economic Innovation Group showed that the largest manufacturing job gains have been in western and Sunbelt states like Texas, Nevada and California. Traditional manufacturing hubs like the industrial Midwest have not seen a similar boost.

And when the jobs do come, they don’t look the same as they once did. “American Factory,” set smack in the middle of the industrial heartland, resets expectations about what it means to be a blue-collar middle-class worker in the United Sates.

The movie begins in December 2008, at the early days of the Great Recession, as the GM plant is shuttered and 10,000 local jobs are lost. The movie then jumps seven years, to 2015, when Fuyao reopens its new sprawling facility in the old factory to great fanfare, hiring a workforce of thousands of American workers and a pool of transferees from China to help them.

But the revival of the factory is far from glorious. One worker says she made $29 per hour “and some change” at GM; at Fuyao, it was $12.84. An early attempt for the workers to organize is met with a warning. When Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) appears at the factory’s opening ceremony and calls for United Auto Workers representation, the Fuyao executives are blindsided. The chairman of Fuyao, Cao Dewang, makes clear that were that to happen, the plant would be shuttered again.

A chunk of the movie focuses on the U.S.-China culture clash that sets in as Chinese workers arrive to work in the plant and as Fuyao tries to impose new standards on the American workforce. In one instance, an American worker complains that the lunchroom’s three microwaves, the only means of a hot meal during breaks, have been on the fritz for weeks. In another part of the factory, a Chinese worker seems unfazed by the reality that he has little time for lunch at all, as he feasts on a diet of just two Twinkies.

The cultural differences are magnified as a group of American supervisors visit the Fuyao headquarters in Shanghai. There, they watch wide-eyed as Chinese workers line up for the start of their shifts as if they were participating in a military drill. One evening, the Americans attend a New Year’s company event that is a strange mixture of corporate pride and patriotism, in which performers sing of “waste eliminated and revenues generated,” and a half dozen couples appear on stage to be married. The American supervisors are amazed. They also are a bit shocked by some of the working conditions they witness at the plant in China, as when they spot a woman sifting through a mountain of discarded glass without much protective gear.

For their part, Fuyao’s Chinese executives struggle with what they see as a slower, more casual American workforce, to the point that it replaces its American management team with a Chinese one, led by Jeff Liu. Liu looks for ways to try to improve the American workers’ performance, even instructing some of his Chinese employees that the best way is to try to flatter them. “You need to use your wisdom to guide them and help them, because we are better than them,” he says.

Yet there is also a weariness among some of the Chinese workers in the U.S. about the sacrifices they have made in the company’s Darwinian push for bottom line results. Some express a bit of regret that their marathon work hours leave them little time for their spouses and children. Even the chairman, Cao, is a bit wistful about the modernization sweeping his country and his own role in leading it.

“I don’t know if I’m a contributor or a sinner,” he says candidly.

The overarching focus is on what modernization and global competition mean for American workers. Directors Stephen Bognar and Julia Reichert, who gained access to the plant and Fuyao executives, following them around over a span of several years, live in the region of the factory. Dayton used to be a community of “folks that worked in factories, but they were middle class citizens. We don’t have that anymore,” Bognar said in an interview. “Workers’ expectations of the security of their life, of their future, are really going down,” Reichert added. “There’s more of an anxiety of the future, and honestly I think that is going to play in the next election, certainly in the heartland of America, where we live.”

The film starts before Trump took office and ends almost a year into his presidency, when life for the workers is still uncertain and wages are still not what they once were. The anxiety captured by the film may have propelled Trump’s victory in 2016, but the high costs of keeping the plant competitive in the global marketplace are not something Trump’s policies have been able to remedy.

This is a problem that resonates far beyond Dayton—and is one to which there are no easy solutions. Trump says his tax cuts have spurred companies to return to the U.S., but there are signs that business investment is getting weaker. Other politicians pitch unionization, but there’s always the possibility that the company would just close the plant rather than see workers unionize. Even Chinese buyouts—not a perfect solution, as the movie makes clear—have slowed. According to the Rhodium Group, overall investment from China fell to a seven-year low in 2018, in part because of the uncertain environment for U.S.-China relations.

As the movie is released, another GM plant in another part of Ohio plans to shut down—this time to sell it to an American electric truck maker. Trump has touted the plans as “great news,” but there are questions whether the prospective new owner has the financial wherewithal to be a savior of lost jobs.

That’s indicative of the way that “American Factory” presents the uncertainties facing the blue-collar workforce.

Near the end of the film, after the Fuyao employees soundly reject UAW representation in a November, 2017 vote, Liu gathers the Dayton workforce for a pep talk and tries to paraphrase Trump.

“We need to create success forever,” he tells them. “Let’s make America good again.”

In a time of diminished expectations, it’s right on the mark."
"Megan Rapinoe believes dad voted for Trump, questions how family could support her and still watch Fox News",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Nicole Darrah', 'Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking', 'Trending News For Foxnews.Com. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/megan-rapinoe-dad-voted-trump-fox-news,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe said she thinks her father voted for President Trump in 2016 — a political choice that provides a stark contrast in her family, as the World Cup-winning forward is nearly as well known for launching broadsides at the Trump administration as she is for launching soccer balls into the back of the net.

Rapinoe, 34, said in an interview published Saturday that she questions how her parents can support her and still watch Fox News (which heavily covered the leadup to the World Cup, the tournament itself and the aftermath).

MEGAN RAPINOE SAYS TRUMP'S MESSAGE 'EXCLUDES PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME' AND 'A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HIS BASE'

""I’m very similar to how they are, even though I think my dad voted for Trump and I’ll say, ‘I don’t get it. How are you simultaneously as proud as punch of me, and watching Fox News all the time, [who are doing] takedowns of your daughter?’"" she told the Guardian. ""That’s why I’m like, ‘You guys need to go to therapy.’”

She said there have ""been some major blow-ups"" with her family, but noted she's very close to them.

""It’s not like, ‘Ugh, I’m from a conservative town and I never talk to them anymore.’ I talk to my parents all the time, every day,"" she said. ""And I feel like I have seen progress and growth. I would love it if people understood you should never say racist things and be O.K. with gay people, or whatever it is. But, obviously, it doesn’t happen that quickly.”

RAPINOE SAYS US WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM WOULD BE 'VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT' SCHUMER'S INVITE TO SENATE

Rapinoe came out as gay in 2012 and often uses her platform as one of the prominent faces of the U.S. women's soccer team for political activism, includes hitting back at the Trump administration.

Despite visiting the White House in 2012, when Barack Obama was president, Rapinoe — who has kneeled during ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before soccer games and otherwise often protests by not placing her hand over her heart during the national anthem — said she would never visit the White House as long as Trump is president. Before her team's FIFA Women's World Cup win in July, Rapinoe said she's ""not going to the f---ing White House,"" and questioned whether the women's squad would even be invited.

Trump in June tweeted he's a ""big fan of the American Team, and Women's Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!""

""We haven’t yet invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!"" Trump added.

MEGAN RAPINOE: 'I'M UNIQUELY AND VERY DEEPLY AMERICAN'

In a later interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Rapinoe said she doesn't “think anyone on the team has any interest in lending the platform that we’ve worked hard to build and the things that we fight for and the way that we live our life.""

“I don’t think we want that to be co-opted or corrupted by this administration...There are so many other people that I would rather talk to and have meaningful conversations that can really affect change in Washington than going to the White House,"" Rapinoe said.

She said that Trump's message is about ""excluding people. You’re excluding me. You’re excluding people that look like me. You’re excluding people of color. You're excluding Americans that maybe support you.""

Rapinoe added: ""We need to have a reckoning with the message that you have and what you're saying about 'Make America Great Again.' I think you are harking back to an era that was not great for everyone.""

How Jill Biden gave away the secret to Joe Biden's 2020 plan,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/joe-biden-2020-electability-trump/index.html,"(CNN) It doesn't take long for Joe Biden's first TV ad in Iowa to get to the point.

""We know in our bones this election is different,"" the ad's narrator says at the start of the commercial. ""The stakes are higher. The threat more serious. We have to beat Donald Trump. And all the polls agree Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job.""

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

On that last line, a series of bar graphs pop up on screen, showing a variety of polls where Biden is beating Trump in hypothetical 2020 matchups.

The ad, which started running Tuesday morning, comes on the heels of the most blatant appeal to electability yet from the Biden camp.

""I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that,"" Jill Biden, the former vice president's wife, told a crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire on Monday . ""But I want you to think about your candidate, his or her electability, and who's going to win this race.""

Added Jill Biden: ""Your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is, but you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'OK, I personally like so-and-so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.""

Which is, well, putting it out there!

The decision by the Biden camp to lean in so heavily on the electability issue is a risk -- albeit a calculated one. Traditionally, primary voters vote with their hearts, not their head. That is to say they tend to choose the candidate that inspires them, not the candidate they think can win. Primary voters don't tend to cast strategic votes with an eye toward the general election. They vote for what they want their own party to look like.

There are, of course, exceptions -- most notably the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in which Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders at least in part because Democrats believed she represented a better chance to keep the White House in Democratic hands.

Clinton's loss to now-President Donald Trump would have seemed to set back the electability argument in future races. (The fact that Trump is president is, in and of itself, a pretty strong argument against prioritizing supposed electability when choosing a candidate.)

And yet ... the new CNN-SSRS poll , which shows Biden maintaining a double-digit lead over Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), suggests that at least at the moment, the electability argument has real salience for Democratic voters. A majority (54%) said that they prioritize nominating a candidate who can beat Trump in November 2020 while just 39% say the most important thing in picking a candidate is that the nominee agrees with their views on issues. (Worth noting: The electability numbers have fallen slightly in the CNN poll; in late June, 61% said a candidate who could beat Trump was the most important element of their vote.)

It's not terribly complicated to understand why electability matters more to Democratic voters in 2020. It's Donald Trump. That's it. While Democratic base voters are rarely thrilled with the actions of a Republican president, Trump's willful disregard of even a semblance of presidential norms coupled with his appointment of two Supreme Court justices, his rolling back of a slew of environmental regulations, his provocations on race and his bullying have made Democrats absolutely desperate to beat him in 2020.

If ever electability was going to be the deciding factor in choosing a Democratic nominee, it's this moment.

The one obvious problem for Biden is that if voters come to believe that while he is the best person to beat Trump, he's not the only person who can do it. Take the latest Fox News poll . Yes, it showed Biden ahead of Trump by 12 points -- 50% to 38%. But it also showed Biden's main rivals for the nomination -- Sanders, Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris -- also all leading Trump by between 6 and 9 points.

If more results like that one come out, the question voters will have to ask themselves is whether a 12-point lead over Trump is so much larger than, say, a 7-point lead that they have to -- to borrow Jill Biden's words -- ""swallow a little bit and say, 'OK, I personally like so and so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.""

How Democratic voters decide that question remains to be seen. But there is now no question that Joe Biden is running on electability, electability, electability."
"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

Justice Dept. again sides with Trump over House in personal financial records fight,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/justice-trump-financial-records/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's Justice Department has again taken President Donald Trump's side in a fight between him -- as a private citizen -- and the US House of Representatives over subpoenas for his personal financial records.

The Justice Department argues the two banks shouldn't have to hand over the subpoenaed information and accuses lawmakers of not taking the correct steps to seek the documents.

This is the first time the Justice Department has spoken up in this subpoena fight. Its foray into the case comes as House Democrats' attempts heat up to get Trump's financial records and to consider formal impeachment proceedings of the President.

On Friday, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to consider whether two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, will have to turn over Trump's information to House committees. Judge Jon Newman, a Jimmy Carter appointee, and Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Peter Hall, both appointed by President George W. Bush, will hear the arguments.

In its legal brief Monday, the Justice Department broadly criticizes how the House authorized the subpoenas before taking a full House vote. They also allege that House Democrats are unfairly targeting the President.

""At best, DACA is legally questionable,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in legal briefs. ""At worst, it is illegal.""

Francisco stressed that the executive branch was within its authority to phase out the Obama-era program and that the lower courts ""erred"" in ""second-guessing"" the Department of Homeland Security's ""entirely rational judgment to stop facilitating ongoing violations of federal law on a massive scale.""

As things stand, two nationwide preliminary injunctions issued by lower courts have forced DHS to continue to allow renewals in the program for nearly two years.

The legal brief comes as the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on November 12. The program has become a focal point in the debate over Trump's proposed US-Mexico border wall and efforts to crack down on immigration. A decision siding with the administration could strip protections for nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers in a case that will come down in the heat of the next election.

Back in 2017, the Trump administration announced it was going to phase out DACA, which it said had been created ""without proper statutory authority.""

The move was immediately challenged in court by the University of California, a handful of states and DACA recipients who argued that the phase-out violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs how agencies can establish regulations.

Courts agreed and issued nationwide injunctions that allowed renewals in the program to continue.

""We conclude,"" wrote a panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, that the rescission of DACA ""is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.""

The Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and last June, the justices agreed to hear the appeal for the upcoming term.

At issue before the Supreme Court is not the legality of the program but how the administration decided to wind it down.

In the new briefs, Francisco argues that the decision to terminate the program was reasonable because the Department of Homeland Security had ""serious doubts"" about its legality. He said the decision was ""more than justified by DHS's serious doubts about the lawfulness of the policy and the litigation risks in maintaining it.""

Supporters of the program urged the court to reject the administration's arguments."

In a legal brief submitted to the court, the lawyers asserted that the president was fully within his rights to eliminate the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and said the lower courts were mistaken when they said Mr. Trump’s action almost two years ago was arbitrary.

The Department of Homeland Security “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” the lawyers argued, disputing the conclusions by the lower court judges about the three reasons the administration gave for ending the program. “None of those three grounds is remotely arbitrary or capricious, let alone all three.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments about the fate of the program in November. The justices could decide the case next spring or summer, just as the presidential election campaign is in full swing."
Bureau of Prisons chief removed in wake of Jeffrey Epstein suicide,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/bureau-of-prisons-director/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr removed the acting head of the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department said Monday, replacing the agency's top official in the wake of the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein earlier this month.

Dr. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, who led the bureau from 1992 to 2003, will be the new director, Barr said.

Barr has said he was ""appalled"" and ""angry"" to learn of the suicide, and cited ""serious irregularities"" at the Manhattan facility where Epstein had been detained.

Barr had already shaken up the top leadership at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, announcing last week that the facility's warden would be reassigned while the FBI and Justice Department's inspector general investigated the conditions leading up to the suicide.

Former US attorney expects 'blockbuster' FISA abuse report from DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-us-attorney-expects-blockbuster-fisa-abuse-report-from-doj-inspector-general,"Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis predicted the Justice Department inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will be ""hard-hitting,"" with multiple recommendations for prosecution.

During an interview Monday on Fox News, Lewis said he used to work with Inspector General Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department and called him as ""tough as a nail."" Lewis added, ""He’s tough, he is smart, and I think the report will be a blockbuster,"" and said, he expects Horowitz's findings to make special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election ""look like a sixth grade book report.""

Asked to explain why, Lewis said, ""It’s going to come out. It’s going to be hard-hitting. [Horowitz] spent almost two years interviewing various people — witnesses. Looking at what he describes [as] almost a million documents. And I think he’s going to make recommendations regarding prosecution and turn this whole FISA — this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the submissions, I think he will turn them on their head.""

British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

[Analysis: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover]

Although some Trump allies have expressed high expectations for Horowitz's report and Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation, others are preaching caution. ""Republicans usually set the bar so high that when we don't meet it, the media narrative then becomes Republicans don't even own their promises. Just promise a fair investigation that goes wherever the facts take us,"" former Republican South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News last month.

Lewis, who served with Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, was reacting an interview Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham did over the weekend in which he said he believes the IG report would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ and its handling of the Russia investigation.

Graham said he wants ""as much as possible"" declassified from Horowitz's report as possible, but former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu warned former FBI Director Christopher Wray might fight to keep its contents classified because he has been ""co-opted by the FBI bureaucracy.""

Lewis said he does not agree with Sununu's assessment, calling Wray a ""good, honest broker,"" but advised the FBI chief to ""err on the side of transparency"" because he suspects the FISA Court may have been used by the FBI to target President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Asked where the investigation is headed, Lewis said former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe ought to be ""worried"" about submissions that were made to the FISA Court.

“You know, Donald Trump the other day said that ‘if he tells a soldier to commit a war crime, the soldier will just go do it,’ ” the video shows Pompeo saying at a March 2016 event in Wichita. “He said, ‘They’ll do as I tell them to do.’ We’ve spent seven-and-a-half years with an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution. We don’t need four more years of that.”

The event took place on the day of the Kansas presidential caucuses, and Pompeo had endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.); after listening to Pompeo’s remarks from backstage, Trump demanded to know who Pompeo was, the New Yorker reported.

Pompeo had come to more enthusiastically embrace Trump by the time the real estate mogul accepted the Republican presidential nomination that summer, and Vice President Pence later recommended him for a job in the Trump administration, according to the magazine.

Trump nominated Pompeo to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency in November 2016, and tapped him to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state in March 2018. As a member of Trump’s administration, Pompeo has been one of the president's most forceful defenders, often sparring with reporters and members of Congress who question Trump’s statements and policy decisions.

In one exchange this year with Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace, Pompeo dismissed the anchor’s questions about Trump’s position on accepting foreign opposition research as “a Washington piece of silliness.”

In another interview with CBS’s Margaret Brennan, Pompeo bristled when asked about the discrepancy between his own statement that China was holding a million Chinese Muslims in “reeducation camps” and Defense Department figures, which put the number closer to 3 million.

“Don’t play ticky-tack,” Pompeo said. “There’s no discrepancy.”

Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil rights statute in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“You have one of the biggest media companies in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in America, in this Amicus Brief they delivered last Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast had no comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."
U.S. Grants Huawei Another Reprieve,https://www.eetimes.com,"['Dylan Mcgrath', 'Brian Santo']",,,,https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335047,"By , 0

SAN FRANCISCO— The U.S. again granted Huawei Technologies a reprieve, extending by 90 days the temporary license program that allows the Chinese telecommunications giant to buy chips and other components from U.S. suppliers.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which announced the extension Monday, said the temporary general license was being extended ""to afford consumers across America the necessary time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent national security and foreign policy threat.""

The Trump Administration in May added Huawei to its ""entity list,"" blacklisting the company from doing business with U.S. companies due to concerns about Huawei's affiliation with Chinese intelligence services. Huawei has long been suspected by U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials of ties to the Chinese government and the potential for Huawei's technology to be used for espionage.

Huawei Ban Could Come Back to Bite U.S.

The ban is widely expected to have a crippling effect on Huawei, which incorporate chips from U.S. companies in much of its infrastructure equipment and smartphone handsets. The Commerce Department on Monday also added 46 additional Huawei affiliates to the entity list.

The temporary general license, which was first announced in May, just days after Huawei was blacklisted, authorizes ""specific, limited engagements in transactions involving the export, reexport, and transfer of items to Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates on the entity list, according to the Commerce Department.

“As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,” said Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, in a statement. “Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the entity listing or temporary general license.”

The semiconductor industry has lobbied the Trump Administration heavily to make exceptions to the export restrictions on Huawei, particularly involving less critical technologies were they argue there is no threat to national security. Chip industry insiders were also critical of the terms of the general temporary license when it was announced in May, with many suggesting it was too vague and too restrictive.

John Neuffer

On Monday, Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) CEO John Neuffer said through a statement that the SIA continues to urge the administration to ""take prompt action on license approvals where there is no nexus to national security."" Neuffer noted that President Trump said at the G-20 meeting in May, that U.S. companies should be allowed to sell products to Huawei as long as the sale does not negatively impact U.S. national security.

“While we are reviewing the announcement today and its implications for the semiconductor industry, we urge the Commerce Department to expedite the review, approval, and issuance of licenses for sales of commercial products that do not raise national security concerns, particularly for items that can be easily substituted by foreign competition not subject to the entity listing,"" Neuffer said.

The Reuters news service initially reported last week that the Commerce Department would extend the temporary general license to allow U.S. companies to continue selling to Huawei. However, Trump said over the weekend that there would be no extension to the general license."

USDA: National THC test for hemp ‘as challenging as you think it is’,https://hempindustrydaily.com,['Et On'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://hempindustrydaily.com/usda-national-thc-test-for-hemp-as-challenging-as-you-think-it-is/,"Federal agriculture authorities are struggling to craft a nationwide THC testing standard so that state and local regulators can tell hemp from marijuana, complicating the release of standardized production rules, according to an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

William Richmond, head of the Specialty Crops Program in the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, told a group of dietary-supplement and CBD business owners last week the agency hoped to have hemp rules prepared by now.

But he said that the USDA is grappling with the Farm Bill‘s requirement for a national THC testing protocol “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“We need to have testing procedures in place,” he said. Coming up with reliable testing methods, he added, is “as complicated as you think it is.”

He gave no timeline for the USDA finishing its work, but said after his speech that USDA still plans to have rules done in time for the 2020 growing season,

The USDA has been “bombarded with questions” about hemp, he added, and is “working hard to issue the hemp regulations.”

He reminded the CBD companies that the USDA’s hemp regulations won’t be final until the industry has had a chance to see them and share feedback.

“Tell us what we got right – and more important, tell us what we got wrong, because we have the opportunity to fix it,” Richmond said.

Which THC?

THC testing has proven a major challenge in moving the hemp industry to a standardized commodity.

Law enforcement authorities from Texas to Florida have said they don’t have tests that can differentiate between legal hemp and illegal marijuana, and the patchwork of testing standards is complicating the Farm Bill’s goal of allowing nationwide commerce for the new crop.

“What we grow in Oregon needs to be able to go to Colorado, to Kentucky, to whatever state and not run into issues with law enforcement,” said Sunny Summers, who coordinates hemp policy for the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

Talking to the same group, a CBD conference in Denver by the American Herbal Products Association, Summers called THC testing “a big, big situation that as an industry we need to deal with.”

The Farm Bill’s direction, she said, doesn’t tell states how to prepare tests “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“This is the No. 1 issue that I have – what the heck does that mean?” Summers said. “What is THC? Which version?”

Industry fears

THC testing protocols coming from the USDA could dramatically shake up the growing hemp industry, growers say. That’s because most U.S. hemp farmers are producing cultivars rich in cannabinoids other than THC – the same types of hemp most likely to violate THC limits depending how and when they are tested.

If post-decarboxylized tests are used, “most of the cultivars and most of the varieties that we’re currently using in U.S. would no longer be defined as hemp,” said Matt Cyrus, who raises hemp along with hay and cattle in Sisters, Oregon.

Talking to Hemp Industry Daily, Cyrus said the USDA’s looming hemp rules could throw many entrepreneurs back to the black market, depending on the testing standard.

“In theory everybody who is has hemp biomass on hand anywhere in the U.S. … would suddenly be outside the law,” said Cyrus, who is also president of the Deschutes County (Oregon) Farm Bureau.

USDA wants to make it easy

Richmond told dietary supplement manufacturers that USDA understands how complex it is to set a national THC testing standard – but he promised that federal authorities are scrambling to give farmers and state and local regulators a solution that simplifies interstate hemp commerce.

“Our goal is to provide a consistent, easy-to-follow regulatory framework around hemp production,” he said.

“I can’t speak to whether that means a hard, prescriptive set of requirements for everybody at this stage. But our goal is to provide consistent standards that make sense for growers and for the industry.”"
Lindsey Graham says Horowitz FISA report will be 'ugly and damning' for DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-horowitz-fisa-report-will-be-ugly-and-damning-for-doj,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted Sunday that the upcoming report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ.

The Republican Senate Judiciary chairman spoke with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures, saying the much-anticipated Horowitz report was “coming out in weeks, not days, not months.” In explaining to Bartiromo why the release of the report had been repeatedly delayed — Attorney General William Barr predicted early this year it would come out in May or June — Graham said “every time you turn around you find something new.”

Graham predicted Horowitz would have a lot to say about ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" at the FBI and DOJ, and would likely have recommendations about what should be done to fix it.





Graham also said once Horowitz finishes his report, it will be sent to the Justice Department for a review for any classified information. The senator said he was meeting with Barr next week to ensure as much of the report as possible is made public.

“I want to declassify as much as possible,” Graham said. “I want the American public to hear the story. I want all of this information to come out. I don’t want people to believe what I say about it — I want them to read for themselves how bad it was.”

""I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russia probe,"" Graham added.

The FBI and DOJ obtained four FISA warrants and renewals against Trump campaign associate Carter Page beginning in October 2016 through June 2017. The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm, and the campaign was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race. Steele’s funding from Democrats was never revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

And newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI too.

Graham explained today that Horowitz “is doing a very in-depth dive about the FISA warrant application” and is looking into “the behavior regarding the counterintelligence operation.” Graham said he believed the evidence would show the FBI’s FISA filings were “a fraud on the court.”

The senator specifically pointed to the FBI being “on notice” that Steele “hated Trump, that he was an unreliable informant,” as well as Steele’s information — “unverified to this day” — allegedly coming from Russian sources and allegedly exonerating nonpublic transcripts of interviews of Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos with an FBI informant, likely Cambridge professor Stefan Halper.

The interactions that Papadopoulos had with the mysterious Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016. Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 about the Russians having “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos then allegedly mentioned this to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who later passed the information along to the FBI, triggering what the FBI dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane.” Republicans now say exonerating information about Papadopoulos was concealed from the FISA Court.

“I want it all out,” Graham emphasized. “I want people to see how off the rails this investigation got, and I want people to be held accountable. And I am patient, I’m not in a hurry to do it, I want to do it right.”"
The 6 things you most need to know about Trump’s new climate plan,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/19/20812243/trump-epa-climate-plan-ace-cpp-6-things,"In June, the Trump administration unveiled its proposed replacement for the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Last week, a coalition of 29 states and cities filed a lawsuit to block the rule, claiming that it violates Trump’s obligations under the Clean Air Act.

And on Sunday, nonpartisan research firm Resources for the Future, along with researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Syracuse University, and the Boston University School of Public Health, released new research showing that even Environmental Protection Agency’s meager projected pollution reductions from its rule are likely overestimated.

The story of EPA carbon regulations is long and tangled, but if you’re in a hurry, here’s the short version: The president’s plan is the bare minimum the EPA thinks it can get away with. It won’t reduce emissions much; in fact, it is likely to increase both carbon dioxide and local air pollutants, along with their health impacts, in more than a dozen states. (Seriously.) And the EPA is going to have a hell of a time justifying it to a court.

Now let’s walk through the longer version of the story. Most coverage so far has focused on the plan’s striking weakness (for obvious reasons), but there are several other aspects of the fight over power plant emissions that are worth understanding. How these policy and legal questions get resolved will have enormous influence on what the next administration — if we ever make it to another administration — can do to address climate change.

So, with that in mind, here are the six things you need to know about Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan.

1) Trump’s EPA is regulating carbon because it has to, not because it wants to

The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed skepticism toward climate change, hostility toward regulation, and an all-consuming hatred for anything with former President Barack Obama’s fingerprints on it. If it had its druthers, it wouldn’t regulate carbon emissions at all.

But it has to. In 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that if the EPA finds that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health, it must regulate them as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In 2009’s Endangerment Finding, the EPA found that, yes, greenhouse gases are a danger to public health.

Those twin developments created a set of legal obligations for the agency. It must:

regulate mobile sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., vehicles — that was Obama’s fuel economy standards, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate new stationary sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., power plants and refineries — that was Obama’s 2013 limits on new sources, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate existing stationary sources of greenhouse gases — that was the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which Trump is now gutting.

Some of the wackier denialists in the conservative coalition were pressing the EPA to challenge the endangerment finding (and former Administrator Scott Pruitt considered it). If successful, that would negate all these obligations. But, perhaps perceiving how futile and silly such an effort would be, the EPA elected not to.

So it was forced to replace, not just cancel, Obama’s fuel economy standards, replace, not just cancel, Obama’s regulations on new power plants, and replace, not just cancel, the Clean Power Plan. Thus, ACE.

2) The legal question at the heart of the dispute over CPP has never been decided by courts

The Clean Air Act (specifically, Section 111) calls upon the EPA to set air pollution standards by determining “the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction … adequately demonstrated.”

Just what constitutes the “best system of emission reduction” is at the heart of the dispute between CPP proponents (environmentalists and Democrats) and critics (polluting industries and Republicans).

After studying the issue for several years, Obama’s EPA realized a few things. First, power plants do not operate in isolation; they are parts of a large, interconnected grid, a single machine, and their operations are determined by its needs. And second, states are already busy reducing greenhouse gas emissions using a variety of policy tools connected to grid operations — fuel-switching from coal to natural gas, adding renewables, energy efficiency, etc.

The EPA concluded that the “best” (most efficient and economical) way to reduce power plant emissions is to support those efforts by requiring states to reduce the average carbon intensity of their overall power sectors. They could reduce the emissions of individual plants, or increase energy efficiency, or build more renewables, or replace coal plants with natural gas. In the argot, the plan allowed emission reductions “beyond the fenceline” of individual power plants.

By setting targets at the aggregate level, rather than at the level of individual power plants, the CPP gave states maximum flexibility (something conservatives ostensibly support in general). It left them more than one tool for compliance.

The alternative — requiring only emission reductions “within the fenceline,” at individual plants — was seen as untenable. The fact is, an individual fossil fuel power plant just doesn’t have the capacity to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions much (absent carbon capture and sequestration, which is still wildly expensive). It can operate more efficiently, getting more power per unit of fuel, but those are improvements at the margin. The only practical way to get substantial reductions from the power sector is to require aggregate reductions.

As soon as the CPP was proposed, a large coalition of 24 states, along with several companies and other groups, sued. (There were actually multiple suits that eventually got consolidated into one.)

The main legal critique was simple: By regulating beyond the fenceline, the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority. (For an in-depth look at the fenceline question, you can read this post.)

In January 2016, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion to stay the CPP while it was under legal consideration. Just a few weeks later, in February, the Supreme Court overrode that decision with a 5-4 decision of its own, issuing a stay on the CPP until the litigation was settled.

Although both sides had already made their case in circuit court, the court agreed to the EPA’s request that it withhold judgment until EPA issues a replacement plan. Since, as was inevitable, that replacement plant has sparked a lawsuit, it will end up in court anyway.

Long story short: Despite what you’d think from listening to Trump administration rhetoric, no court has yet ruled on the fenceline question. And a court eventually must.

Obama’s EPA did its homework, and beyond-the-fenceline proponents are confident of their case, at least in circuit court. But the case is likely to go back to the Supreme Court, and, well, we all know how that’s going.

If courts end up rejecting the Trump EPA’s inside-the-fenceline interpretation, it would throw the agency into chaos. But it would give a Democratic successor administration free rein to issue a new, stronger CPP (which the Resources for the Future analysis says could reduce electricity sector emissions 37 percent above the baseline case by 2030).

If courts accept the narrow interpretation, it would be an enormous blow to Democratic efforts on climate change going forward, putting the Clean Air Act, at least Section 111, out of reach as a carbon reduction tool.

3) ACE is so weak, it could potentially lead to higher emissions

Trump’s EPA accepted the inside-the-fenceline restriction that Obama’s EPA found untenable, so ACE only applies to individual plants. Consequently, it won’t reduce carbon emissions much.

The CPP did not set mandatory carbon reduction targets, but the EPA calculated that if states opted for the most stringent pollution control plans, the CPP would yield electricity sector emission reductions of 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. (Since EPA’s 2015 analysis, progress on clean energy has been incredibly rapid. We now know that most of the emission reductions CPP targeted were going to happen anyway. Thus the need for an updated CPP.)

ACE, on the other hand, might not reduce emissions at all relative to baseline. It might even raise them. Yes, you read that right: Trump’s pollution rule might produce more pollution than no rule at all.

How is that possible? Well, remember, ACE applies only to individual power plants (coal plants, mostly), and the only way to improve the emissions performance of individual power plants is through efficiency upgrades. But efficiency upgrades — heat rate improvements (HRI), in the lingo — make those plants cheaper to run.

If they’re cheaper to run, utilities will run them more often. That will increase their net emissions. Resources for the Future refers to this as “rebound” and says the EPA underestimates it in several ways.

First, the agency plans changes to New Source Review — pollution standards that must be met by new or upgraded plants — to make it easier to upgrade coal plants without triggering new standards. (See No. 4, below.) That will have the effect of boosting HRI. In the initial draft release of ACE, those standards changes were included. But in the final rule, they were left out, enabling the EPA to lowball HRI.

But the agency still plans to make those changes to New Source Review; by failing to include them in its analysis of ACE, it is deliberately hiding the ball.

Second, in its analysis, the EPA excluded two of the best technologies for HRI (blade path upgrades and redesign/replace economizers — don’t ask). And third, the agency’s analysis excludes the Section 45Q tax credit passed by Congress, which would offer tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration.

Long story short, even the administration’s paltry project carbon emission reductions from ACE — between 0.7 and 1.5 percent lower than baseline — are likely overstated. In fact, coal plants are likely to run more than EPA estimates, will means CO2 will fall less (or not at all) and other local air pollutants will increase in many states, with all their concomitant health effects.

A final note: reductions of 0.7 to 1.5 percent are basically a rounding error and they hinge entirely on the market fate of coal plants. Resources for the Future ran an analysis of several different market scenarios and found that even small changes in market assumptions — demand, the price of natural gas, etc. — could wipe out those gains.

Basically, ACE isn’t a serious plan to reduce carbon emissions. It’s more of a statement by Trump’s EPA that it doesn’t have the power to reduce power sector carbon emissions.

4) Gutting New Source Review (which goes along with ACE) could also raise emissions

From an environmental perspective, the original sin of the Clean Air Act (at least the 1970 and 1990 amendments to the CAA) was grandfathering.

The presumption was that new power plants would be built with modern pollution controls and old plants would gradually phase out and close down. So existing plants were grandfathered in — they didn’t have to meet the new standards.

To ensure that existing plants didn’t increase their pollution in the meantime, the CAA standards applied not only to new plants but to existing plants that made substantial upgrades that would increase their pollution. More specifically, “any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted” would trigger the standards.

Any utility planning a new plant or a plant upgrade has to submit to the New Source Review to ensure they’re meeting pollution standards.

So if utilities built new plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. If they upgraded old plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. But if they just kept their polluting old plants running and running forever, without upgrades, they didn’t have to meet modern pollution standards. And so that’s what they did.

Consequently, the US has been saddled with a large, old fleet of dirty coal plants for decades, with utilities making just enough repairs to keep them in operation but not enough modifications and upgrades to trigger New Source Review. The average age of a US coal plant is 39 years — roughly its rated life span.

Environmentalists have complained about these plants for ages, saying that utilities should shut them down. Utilities have also complained, saying the prohibitive costs of NSR are preventing them from upgrading their fleets.

Obama’s CPP was supposed to finally get at those old plants. Given the way NSR has traditionally worked, ACE would have too. It would have forced plants to make efficiency improvements, which would have triggered NSR, which would have triggered tighter standards. (By EPA’s own estimate, 80 percent of coal-fired power plants do not meet current NSR standards for local air pollutants.)

Trump’s EPA doesn’t want utilities to face the terrifying prospect of being forced to clean up their old fleets (“enormous new permitting burdens”), so it plans to “reform” New Source Review. It will no longer be an increase in total emissions that triggers the review — only an increase in a plant’s hourly emissions rate. If a plant reduces its hourly emissions rate, increases its total runtime, and thus increases its total emissions, no problem.

New Source Review is one of the very few regulatory tools available to reach these existing, dirty plants, and EPA wants to take it off the table. Long-term, that could free lots of utilities to update their dirty old coal plants (to comply with ACE) and keep them running even longer.

5) Even after torturing the numbers, the EPA couldn’t make ACE look like a good deal

The awkward fact for Republicans has always been that air quality regulations work. They produce social, economic, and health benefits well in excess of their compliance costs. There is a robust literature and a long practical history showing as much. (See here for the EPA’s cost-benefit analyses on the CAA, which links to dozens of independent sources.)

At every new round of regulations, conservatives and polluting industries complain that they are too onerous, that they will destroy the economy, cost jobs, raise energy prices. And every time, it doesn’t happen. Compliance proves cheaper than expected, the economy continues growing, and public health improves.

Republicans have not responded to this reality by accepting that they were wrong about air quality regulations. Instead, they’ve responded by trying to game the numbers, massaging cost-benefit calculations to give more amenable outcomes.

That continues in the ACE proposal. As Brad Plumer reported in a great New York Times piece, the EPA no longer counts climate benefits that occur outside US borders, which is both morally and atmospherically daft.

But even more daft, rather than the Obama administration’s 3 percent discount rate, Trump’s EPA is using a discount rate of 7 percent.

Discount rates refer to how much future benefits are “discounted” when expressed in today’s dollars — or more colloquially, how highly we value future benefits. (A higher rate means we value them less; a lower rate, more. A rate of zero means we value them equally as much as present benefits.)

A 7 percent discount rate is at the high end of what markets and governments use for personal investments, i.e., how much individual investors value their future profits. But applied to intergenerational investments, i.e., how much sacrifice we’re collectively willing to impose on future generations, it is sociopathic.

“If you use a rate above 5 percent,” Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland, told Plumer, “you’re essentially saying that we shouldn’t worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now.” (If you want to dig deeper, here is a post I once did on discount rates, using otters.)

Using these tricks and others, all of which make the rule more legally vulnerable, EPA cut its estimate of the “social cost of carbon” — the total societal value of a ton of GHG emission reductions — from around $50 (the Obama administration’s median number, arrived at after an extensive interagency process that Trump has tried to cancel) to between $1 and $7 (a value rectally extracted by Trump’s EPA over the course of months).

Naturally, that makes cutting greenhouse gases look a lot less attractive. But here’s the first twist.

Even if the climate benefits of the CPP are cut close to nothing, the other benefits, primarily in reductions of local air pollutants like SO2 and NOx, still more than pay for it. That’s true even though the EPA ignored many benefits it claimed to be unable to quantify.

EPA says they are ""unable to quantify the economic value of changes in exposure to mercury, carbon monoxide, SO2, and NO2, ecosystem effects or visibility impairment"" in regulatory impact analysis https://t.co/YDFACjisfg — ⚡Taylor Kuykendall (@taykuy) August 21, 2018

EPA just couldn’t make the numbers work for it.

And so, as Lisa Friedman first reported for the New York Times, according to the EPA’s analysis, “the new rules could also lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 from an increase in the extremely fine particulate matter that is linked to heart and lung disease, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, a rise in bronchitis, and tens of thousands of missed school days.” (And the Resources for the Future analysis shows that those numbers are almost certainly conservative.)

Yes, the EPA is proposing a policy that it concedes will lead to 1,400 premature deaths, 48,000 new cases of “exacerbated asthma,” and at least 21,000 new missed days of school every year, through 2030. That should be fun to justify to a court.

And as Nathanael Johnson noted in Grist, EPA’s analysis shows that ACE’s net costs outweigh its net benefits:

EPA’s press officers aren’t exactly highlighting the findings that the proposal would leave Americans worse off. In a fact sheet, for example, the EPA trumpets its finding that ACE could save power plants up to $6.4 billion in compliance costs. But wade into the details to look up that scenario (check out table 18 on page 165), and you see that the EPA weighs that $6.4 billion against health costs that run between $16.6 billion and $75 billion.

“When an agency wants to do something that’s harmful to the American people, it typically tries to hide it,” Richard Revesz of the Institute for Policy Integrity told Johnson. “What’s unusual here is that the EPA just comes out and says it.”

However — and here’s the second twist — Trump’s EPA is currently working to rectify the situation.

As Friedman smartly notes, the massive study upon which EPA bases much of its work on the health effects of particulates (the famous Harvard “Six Cities” study) would be excluded from EPA consideration if the administration’s daffy “secret science” proposal goes through.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan reported, the proposal would exclude from EPA analysis any study in which participants’ identities are concealed — which is most big public health studies, for obvious reasons. Experts are almost unanimously horrified by the proposal, including the EPA’s science advisers, but it appears to be moving forward.

So enjoy this particular EPA analysis (yet another triumph of career staff over their political hack bosses). The next time EPA runs cost-benefit analysis on an air rule, it won’t include many of the health benefits of pollution reductions, because it will have consciously prevented itself from knowing about them.

6) We may have already reached the CPP’s 2030 goal; it’s time for more ambition, not less

According to the Sustainable Energy In America Factbook, US power sector emissions are down 28 percent from 2005 levels. The researchers at Rhodium Group estimate that they will be down 37 percent by 2025.

That means the CPP reach target for 2030 — 32 percent reduction — will likely be achieved in the next few years, just based on current market trends.

This extraordinary progress has been hard-won, utility by utility, and the CPP — even though it never went into effect! — was a big part of that. The tangible prospect of federal regulations got every state and utility, even those with no interest in climate change, thinking, talking, and planning around carbon reductions. And guess what? When utilities start looking around in earnest, they find that cutting carbon is pretty easy.

Reducing electricity sector emissions has proven much cheaper and easier than envisioned even by the optimists at Obama’s EPA. The sensible thing to do in this situation is to boost the plan’s ambition.

In comparing the ACE to the CPP, remember that the emissions baseline has changed a lot since 2014 thanks to cheap renewables and natural gas. @EPA could have responded to this by raising the ambition bar. Instead, they lowered it. pic.twitter.com/REdDtPiy9x — Trevor Houser (@TrevorGHouser) August 21, 2018

It is difficult to know just how much the weakening of CPP into ACE will blunt that progress — how much progress still depends on policy and how much it has taken on a market momentum of its own. (One thing upon which virtually every expert agrees: US coal is going to continue dying.)

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University took a look at prospects for the electricity sector hitting Paris climate targets without the CPP. They found that it basically depends on natural gas prices. If they stay low or fall further, there’s a chance of hitting 2025 and 2030 Paris targets. Even if they rise a bit, Paris targets are still within reach, though “it becomes essential for many of the existing regulatory and tax inducements to be retained, and perhaps enhanced.” (In particular, they mention renewing federal renewable energy tax credits, which are set to expire.)

But there is broad consensus in the energy community that even if the electricity sector can limp past the 2030 finish line without (much) supportive federal policy, there’s no way the US will get on track for its longer-term carbon targets (80 percent reductions by 2050) without concerted policy support.

Depending on how courts rule on the fenceline issue, it’s possible that a Democratic administration that takes power in January 2021 could almost immediately issue a strengthened CPP, targeting, say, 80 percent electricity sector reductions by 2030, which will definitely wipe out all the coal and rein in natural gas.

Alternatively, if a Supreme Court decision with Brett Kavanaugh restricts the EPA to inside the fenceline, the prospect of substantially reducing carbon emissions using EPA regulations will basically be off the table, leaving federal legislation — or action at the state and local level — the only road forward on climate change.

Even more alternatively, if Trump wins reelection, the EPA by 2024 is likely to be a thoroughly degraded agency, its rules and staff stacked in favor of industry and most of its institutional memory and expertise lost. And the US will be out of the global climate effort entirely, a rogue actor lurching in the direction of myopic greed during the years the world most needs solidarity."
Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/457997-recessions-happen-when-presidents-overlook-key-problems,"Well, President Trump Donald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE is at it again—lashing out at commentators who suggest a recession could be coming. He believes that such talk is merely alarmist criticism meant to scuttle his reelection. But the president and his staff have access to the best economic data. And there are clear signs in the data that a slowdown may be on the way.

No doubt, uncertainty about the ongoing trade conflict with China isn’t helping things. Trump has applied tariffs en masse against Chinese imports. While tariffs can assist specific industries when utilized in a targeted, strategic manner, his broad duties on most products from China have backfired. The tariffs are beginning to hurt U.S. consumers, as well as farmers and other exporters.

Even with the tariffs, the U.S. manufacturing sector is slowing. The July manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management came in at its lowest level since August 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT

But there’s more. Despite the Trump tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit is still climbing, particularly with China. The U.S. goods trade deficit reached $875 billion in 2018, an increase of 10 percent in the past year alone.

Realistically, much of the recent growth in the U.S. economy was fueled by a large cash injection from the December 2017 tax cut along with increased federal spending. The administration’s subsequent, large-scale borrowing has also thrown more loose money into the economy. But these short-term, stimulatory effects are now starting to wash out.

Here’s the real problem, though—and why a recession could be drawing closer. The U.S. dollar has become substantially overvalued, in part due to a slowdown in global credit. This stronger dollar is cutting into U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while also lowering farm prices. It’s a serious burden on America’s productive economy. There are signs that the U.S. economy is cooling, and it’s time to consider concrete steps to prevent a downturn.

As the U.S. dollar keeps climbing, imports become cheaper. And U.S. exports grow more expensive. What’s causing this overvaluation is a continuing inflow of foreign capital into America’s financial markets. This flood of private overseas investment is driving up demand for the dollar. And the resulting appreciation is making it harder for domestic manufacturers to sell their goods abroad or to compete against imports that keep growing cheaper here in the U.S.

The situation has actually gotten worse, though, because Trump’s economic policies have actually helped fuel the dollar’s rise. Increased federal borrowing has attracted even more foreign capital, which further strengthens the dollar. The Federal Reserve reports that the dollar has climbed 25 percent in the past five years. And China has also played its ace in the hole, allowing its currency to fall recently, resulting in an overall 11.4 percent decline since March of 2018, when tariffs were first imposed.

The president’s policies are now backfiring because the dollar’s rise is offsetting the impact of his tariffs. And in the face of this, the Congressional Budget Office foresees a perfect storm: Rising imports will drive America’s current account deficit up from $449 billion in 2017 to more than $700 billion in 2021. Concurrently, the U.S. goods trade deficit is accelerating, and may exceed $1 trillion within the next two years. And that could tip the nation into a new recession.

Trump has made varying comments about the strength of the dollar. But he’s avoided taking action. And that leaves us with a status quo of rising trade deficits, collapsing farm prices, and the fading effects of a 2017 cash injection.

To avert a possible recession, Washington needs to act. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) have introduced bipartisan legislation that would empower the Federal Reserve to tax foreign purchases of U.S. stocks, bonds, and other assets. That could address the influx of foreign capital investment currently driving the dollar to new heights. And it would gradually lower the U.S. dollar to a competitive, trade-balancing level.

The current trajectory for the U.S. economy is troubling. One way to achieve meaningful action would be to prioritize federal efforts that can restore the competitiveness of America’s productive industries. Lowering the dollar’s value through the recently introduced Senate currency bill offers a promising start.

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

DOJ arrests Chicago man who allegedly threatened attack on women's reproductive clinic,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-arrests-chicago-man-allegedly-threatened-attack-womens/story?id=65063192,"The Department of Justice has announced federal charges against a Chicago man who prosecutors say threatened an attack against a women's reproductive clinic, the latest in a string of potential mass attacks thwarted by law enforcement.

Farhan Sheikh, 19, was arrested last Friday evening after posting on the social media platform iFunny that he would attack a local clinic and ""proceed to slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor I see in the area and I will not back down,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Chicago,

""Consider this a warning for anyone visiting,"" Sheikh allegedly wrote.

The indictment does not list the clinic where Sheikh was allegedly threatening to carry out his attack, but said it is approximately 4 miles from his residence in Chicago.

In a post to the platform last week, Sheikh wrote he was ""done"" with Illinois' ""abortion laws and allowing innocrnt (sic) kids to be slaughtered for the so called 'womans right' [expletive].""

According to the complaint, when investigators confronted Sheikh at his residence about the posts he admitted they were his but sought to downplay the seriousness of his threats, despite accompanying posts that warned his threats weren't ""satirical.""

Sheikh was charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which is punishable by up to five years in prison.

The arrest follows at least three possible mass attacks thwarted by law enforcement over the weekend, with suspects arrested in Connecticut, Florida and Ohio.

The FBI directly assisted in two of the cases. In Connecticut, a 22-year-old man was charged with illegal possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines after authorities discovered a Facebook post where he expressed interest in carrying out a mass shooting.

In Ohio, police arrested a 20-year-old man who was a self-proclaimed white nationalist that had allegedly posted on Instagram what investigators believed was a threat to carry out an attack on a local Jewish center. He has pleaded not guilty to telecommunications harassment and aggravated menacing.

And in Florida, a 25-year-old man was arrested after allegedly sending text messages where he expressed interest in carrying out the ""longest confirmed kill ever"" and was strategizing about locations where to carry out his attack, officials said.

Last week, Attorney General William Barr said the DOJ was crafting a bill that would seek to expedite death penalty proceedings for mass shooters, following a directive from President Trump in the wake of the El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio shootings."

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

"USDA finds religious exempt chicken, small operators have pathogen problems",https://www.foodsafetynews.com,"['Coral Beach', 'Guest Contributor', 'Dan Flynn', 'Bill Marler', 'August', 'Powered By']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/08/usda-finds-religious-exempt-chicken-small-operators-have-pathogen-problems/,"Tests showed a higher than average prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter in chicken that is produced under religious exemptions and at low-volume facilities, but the government is not going to propose rules for them.

In a process that began in June 2017, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) collected and tested more than 3,600 samples, according to an update this week. The sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that it will no longer sample or test the specific products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.

“FSIS found that generally religious exempt poultry products and a subset of the low volume products sampled have a higher than national average rate of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination,” the government reported.

But, saying those products make up a small portion of the country’s food supply, the USDA does not plan to take action toward regulation. A campaign to raise awareness is planned instead.

“The agency does not intend to propose performance standards for these products at this time,” according to the update.

“FSIS will use these results to conduct outreach with the industry and consumers to encourage the safe production and handling of these raw poultry products.”

The FSIS testing project specifically involved religious exempt chicken carcasses and low-volume poultry products. The agency “will no longer sample or test the products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.”

Neither religious exempt carcasses nor chicken products produced in low-volume operations are not subject to the government’s Salmonella contamination standards that apply to other chicken. Chicken carcasses that are religiously exempt from certain federal laws already do not receive the USDA inspection mark, which is printed inside the agency’s seal on non-exempt chicken.

Low-volume products are defined by federal code as being produced with an average daily volume of 1,000 pounds or less. The FSIS tested more than 3,600 samples of low-production chicken.

Beginning in June 2017, FSIS collected more than 150 samples from religious exempt chicken carcasses and tested them for Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination.

Both Salmonella and Campylobacter can cause serious illnesses and sometimes death in humans."
Brother called FBI to investigate State Department official over hate,https://wtkr.com,['Cnn Wire'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://wtkr.com/2019/08/20/brother-called-fbi-to-investigate-state-department-official-over-hate/,"The brother of a State Department official linked to a white nationalist group by a civil rights organization tells CNN he reported his sibling to the FBI out of concern about his hateful views.

Matthew Gebert, the State Department employee, has been placed on administrative leave from his job as a foreign affairs officer in the Department’s Bureau of Energy Resources after the civil rights organization’s made the claim.

Gebert’s brother, Michael Gebert, told CNN on Thursday that details in the extensive report released last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch initiative are accurate.

Hatewatch alleged that Matthew Gebert “oversaw the Washington, DC-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online.” According to the report, he used a pseudonym — Coach Finstock — to express “a desire to build a country for whites only.”

‘I was just so angry’

Michael Gebert identified his older brother as the man in a photo Hatewatch posted of white nationalists gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, months before the Unite the Right rally that resulted in the killing of a counter-protestor, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Michael Gebert also said it was his brother’s voice speaking as “Coach Finstock” on a white nationalist podcast and confirmed Hatewatch’s reporting that he had contacted the FBI about his brother last month through an electronic tip form on the bureau’s website.

“He’s had all this hate growing and accelerating under his skin,” the younger Gebert told CNN in a phone interview after Hatewatch released a report about his outreach to the FBI. “Everything else is keeping up good appearances.”

He told CNN he made the decision to contact the FBI out of concern for his brother’s children.

“It didn’t take courage to submit a tip to the FBI,” he said. “I was just so angry.”

Michael Gebert says he and his brother have long disagreed over politics.

‘So much evil’

Matters reached a head about a year ago at a family gathering in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he said. After drinking some alcoholic beverages, he said his brother Matthew began using language about Jews, immigrants and minorities that concerned and frightened him.

Michael Gebert explained “it took everything in me” to not react in a violent manner. He said he told his brother, “Matt, I wanna smash your face in.”

He told Hatewatch of that evening: “I saw so much evil in my brother, I could not f**king deal with it.” Even so, Michael Gebert told CNN he still has some sympathy for his brother.

The State Department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Michael Gebert’s efforts to warn authorities about his brother’s activities.

The FBI said it does not comment on tips. The agency said it can’t investigate people for holding an ideology or belonging to certain US-based hate groups.

Attempts by CNN to reach Matthew Gebert have been unsuccessful. Hatewatch said in its report that the group’s investigators had been unable to speak to him.

Gebert joined the State Department in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s administration, as a “presidential management fellow,” according to an alumni magazine from his alma mater George Washington University. According to the program’s website, it “attracts and selects the best candidates possible, but is really designed with a more narrow focus – developing a cadre of potential government leaders.”"
"Colorado area missed air quality deadline, plans to improve",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/colorado-area-missed-air-quality-deadline-plans-to-improve,"FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a Colorado region missed its air quality standards deadline.

The Coloradoan reports that the EPA is expected to mark the nine-county North Front Range region that includes Denver county in serious noncompliance with a federal standard.

Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease.

Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard on Friday in the region to reduce the effects.

Experts say air quality improved on average over the last decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.

Officials say the region withdrew an extension request to meet the deadline to better prioritize improvement plans.

It shouldn't be partisan or divisive to want a moral role model in the White House,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Robert Schmuhl', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/20/presidents-should-be-moral-role-models-is-trump-new-normal-column/2054079001/,"FDR called the presidency 'a place of moral leadership.' That's what I've taught students for decades. Will we get that back after Donald Trump?

I received an overture the other day to compose a journalistic effusion on the consequences of presidents — well, to be specific, one president — trafficking in conspiracy theories and using the news media to amplify unverified, if not completely false, allegations. You can probably guess that an aging president-watcher would harbor a view or two on that subject. But, in a rare spasm of wordsmith reluctance, I declined.

In this political environment, to sound off about a commander in chief promoting baseless balderdash would undoubtedly lead to labeling by the officeholder’s base supporters as an “enemy” of those people or worse. We know where he stands, I could hear some readers say while rejecting the argument.

When this happens, the give-and-take of democratic conversation goes by the wayside amid a hyperpartisan atmosphere that pervades the media writ large and the public in general. Instead of the open-minded discussion of public problems a self-governing people deserves, it seems as though more and more citizens are wearing blinkers to focus their attention on party-identified differences they deem worthy of approbation or condemnation. With those blinkers firmly in place, they lose sight of the middle ground between extremes.

'Decent respect' should be the norm

At the same time polarizing partisanship has become so brass-knuckled and fierce, historic norms, conventions and traditions of the White House have of late either come under assault or been abandoned altogether. Having (in the phrase of the Declaration of Independence) “a decent respect” for the office of president and those who’ve occupied it should be natural. The genuine friendships between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter as well as between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, rivals in the campaigns of 1976 and 1992, respectively, attest to that.

However, the recent suggestion sent via Twitter to over 63 million followers that one former president might be involved in murder gives new meaning to the word “unconventional” for anyone attempting to describe a successor to George Washington.

When Franklin Roosevelt was campaigning for his first of four White House victories in 1932, he called the presidency “preeminently a place of moral leadership.” For nearly a half-century, through Democratic and Republican administrations, I’ve taught and written with Roosevelt’s insight as a lodestar or guiding principle of nonpartisan — and one always prays — fair analysis in assessing presidents, what they say and their actions.

How to define moral leadership

Though a precise definition of moral leadership is elusive for politically minded souls, some essential characteristics stand out, I’d emphasize for students or readers. From a foundation of integrity and honesty, the public figure needs to add inspiration, empathy and courage. Over time that amalgamation of attributes can develop into a full-fledged vision for governing that’s based on credibility and trust.

Individual political judgments about the merits of such leadership will differ, of course, but the reasons for pursuing one or another course are clear and usually revolve around fundamental questions. What’s the right course for the people and country? How can women and men across the nation come together to address problems? Who share these standards for governance and might be willing to help?

Unfortunately, when theory and practice collide like speeding trains, dispassionate evaluation goes off the tracks, throwing the neutral observer into a ditch of perilous surroundings. In this circumstance, even a tepid, wishy-washy explanation invariably gets interpreted as taking one side or another in whatever newsworthy matter might be playing out at the moment.

It's not partisan to want a role model

Looking beyond a particular moment looms the larger concern about the future. Put more starkly: Is what’s happening now an anomaly or an augury? Can we expect at some point to see a return to norms established by previous presidents, or will the spirit of “anything goes” continue for winners of the White House?

In sketching out traits of moral leadership on the blackboard for students, I would always include one other requirement in the inventory: emulation. Is the president (or the candidate who’s running for our highest office) someone possessing the character and temperament that other people can recognize and respect, no matter the person’s political affiliation?

Call me hopelessly old-fashioned, even deplorably die-hard, but wanting a role model in the Oval Office shouldn’t be too outlandish a dream for Americans, young, middle-age or elderly. That heartfelt wish chooses no partisan side — just the common, and national, good.

Sean Hannity: Sources say 'most explosive' part of DOJ review is about 'outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-most-explosive-part-of-doj-review-about-outsourcing-of-illegal-intelligence-gathering,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said his sources are telling him the most ""explosive"" finding in the Justice Department review on the origins of the Russia investigation has to do with illegal intelligence-gathering on American citizens.

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Department of Justice Backs Led Zeppelin in ‘Stairway to Heaven’ Copyright Case,https://variety.com,"['Jem Aswad Gene Maddaus', 'Jem Aswad', 'Gene Maddaus']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/led-zeppelin-trump-stairway-to-heaven-copyright-case-1203305048/,"The U.S. Department of Justice has weighed in on the next big music copyright case on the horizon following the Katy Perry “Dark Horse” decision, and taken Led Zeppelin’s side in the long-running copyright dispute that pits the writers of the group’s anthem “Stairway to Heaven” against the publishers of the earlier song “Taurus” by Spirit.

The DOJ filed an amicus brief late Thursday supporting Zeppelin against a claim by the trustees of the late Spirit singer/guitarist Randy Wolfe — a.k.a. Randy California — that it lifted a musical passage for its song from “Taurus.”

Michael Skidmore, the trustee of the Randy Craig Wolfe Trust, sued the band in 2014, arguing that “Stairway to Heaven” ripped off elements of Wolfe’s composition. A jury ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin in 2016, finding that the two songs were not substantially similar.

Skidmore appealed, and on Friday a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new trial. The panel found that U.S. District Court Judge Gary Klausner gave instructions that failed to make clear that an arrangement of otherwise unprotectable elements in a song can be sufficiently original to merit copyright protection.

“Without a selection and arrangement instruction, the jury instructions severely undermined Skidmore’s argument for extrinsic similarity, which is exactly what the jury found lacking,” wrote Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez, for the court.

Paez also faulted Klausner for refusing to allow Skidmore’s attorney to play “Taurus” while Jimmy Page was testifying. The attorney was seeking to show that Page had access to “Taurus” when “Stairway to Heaven” was composed, but Klausner ruled that playing the song with the jury present could be confusing.

But in June, the full Ninth Circuit said it would hear the appeal again. On Thursday, the Justice Department said the trial judge was correct in ruling that the only work subject to copyright protection was the sheet music — which was filed with the copyright office — and not sound recordings, and that the relevant portion of the songs is not virtually identical.

Thursday’s move is significant for a number of reasons, not least because the juries in the recent “Dark Horse” and 2015 “Blurred Lines” decision — in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found to have infringed on the copyright of Marvin Gaye’s song “Got to Give It up” based on a similar “feel” — ruled against the defendants, which in this case is Led Zeppelin.

The case goes before the appeals court next month."
Trump aides look into U.S. purchasing Greenland after directives from president,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Damian Paletta', 'Reporter Covering Economic Policy', 'Congress', 'Campaigns', 'Health Policy', 'Pennsylvania Politics', 'Damian Paletta Is White House Economic Policy Reporter For The Washington Post.

The presidential request has bewildered aides, some of whom continue to believe it isn’t serious, but Trump has mentioned it for weeks. The two people with knowledge of the presidential demand spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to reveal such White House planning.

As with many of Trump’s internal musings, aides are waiting for more direction before they decide how seriously they should look into it.

Among the things that have been discussed is whether it is even legal, what the process would be for acquiring an island that has its own government and population, and where any money to purchase a giant landmass would originate.

Trump’s interest in acquiring Greenland was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Greenland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that the island is not for sale.

“Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism,” the ministry said in a tweet. “We’re open for business, not for sale.”

[‘Not for sale:’ How Greenland and Denmark are reacting to Trump’s apparent interest]

According to the CIA’s World Factbook, Greenland is 2.2 million square kilometers, with 1.7 million of that covered in ice. It has considerable natural resources, such as coal and uranium, but only 0.6 percent of the land is used for agriculture. It has about 58,000 residents, making it one of the world’s smallest countries by population.

It is a self-governing country that is part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump is scheduled to visit Denmark in two weeks.

The idea of a sale to the United States was also ridiculed Friday by politicians in Denmark, including Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who was the country’s prime minister until June and now serves as the leader of the opposition party.

“It must be an April Fool’s Day joke ... but totally out of season!” he wrote on Twitter.

Trump had touted his career as a real estate developer during the 2016 presidential campaign and made clear that he has retained an eye for real estate opportunities during his tenure in the White House. For example, he has said that North Korea could build famous hotels and resorts along its oceanfront properties, even though many foreigners are afraid to visit the country out of fear for their lives.

Typically, Congress must appropriate money before the White House can use it, but Trump has already shown a willingness to get around those restrictions.

It was unclear why Trump might want the United States to buy Greenland, though his administration has identified the Arctic as an area of growing importance to U.S. national security interests.

“This is America’s moment to stand up as an Arctic nation,” Pompeo said in May during a speech in Finland. “The region has become an arena of global power and competition.”

With melting ice making the region more accessible, the United States has been firm in trying to counter any moves by Russia and China in the Arctic. China declared itself a “near-Arctic nation” last year and has defended its desire for a “Polar Silk Road” in which Chinese goods would be delivered by sea from Asia to Europe.

China recently sought to bankroll the construction of three airports in Greenland, drawing concern from then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and prompting the Pentagon to make the case to Denmark that it should fund the facilities itself rather than rely on Beijing.

“Countries should be wary of piling on monumental debt, particularly ‘loan to own’ projects, that undermines their freedom of political action and sovereign choices,” a Pentagon official, Johnny Michael, said previously. “Beijing’s lack of transparency in its polar research, expeditionary activities and approach to natural resource development is also of concern.”

Trump’s desire to buy Greenland wouldn’t be the first time an American president broached the idea.

The U.S. military had a presence on Greenland during World War II as a means to protect the continent if Germany ever tried to attack. After the war, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million to buy Greenland, according to the academic tome “Exploring Greenland: Cold War Science and Technology on Ice.”

Since then, the Danish people have been wary of the United States’ continued use of Greenland. The land was critical territory during the Cold War because of its location halfway between the United States and Northern Europe and its proximity to the former Soviet Union. The Pentagon built its northernmost military installation, Thule Air Base, on Greenland in 1951, as a means for missile defense.

“Exploring Greenland,” co-written by academics from Denmark and the United States, says that the U.S. military’s “extensive activities in northern Greenland” was seen by Danish citizens and some politicians as “a violation of their national sovereignty.""

Some on Thursday night responded to the news with incredulity; others, with support.

“This idea isn't as crazy as the headline makes it seem,” Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) said in a tweet. “This a smart geopolitical move. The United States has a compelling strategic interest in Greenland, and this should absolutely be on the table.”

Most, however, responded with mockery.

Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) shared a news story about Trump’s idea and mused: “A Great place for his ‘presidential’ library.”

And Jonah Goldberg, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, tweeted that MAGA — the acronym for Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan — is “an anagram of Make Greenland American Already.”

USDA researchers in Greeley are using technology to maximize water use for farmers,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/greeley/usda-researchers-in-greeley-are-using-technology-to-maximize-water-use-for-farmers,"GREELEY, Colo. -- Researchers in Greeley are using drones to help farmers conserve water when growing their crops.

Working as an agricultural engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Kendall DeJonge says their research is aimed at maximizing the water farmers use in order for them to save water and profit.

“We’re kind of trying to look at crop per drop, so if you can maximize your yield when you have less water, that’s sort of what we’re exploring here,"" DeJonge said.

To get the most “crop per drop,” the team flies drones over their fields. Equipped with special cameras, they pinpoint which areas need more water and which places can go without.

They also use temperature and moisture sensors to see how little water a plant can take while still yielding a harvest.

“Really, the goal at the end of the day is to make money, so if we can optimize the grain yield for the water they have available so they can be profitable, then that’s what we’re really talking about,” said DeJonge.

A local farmer in the area, Randy Knutson, says people sometimes take for granted how food gets on their tables and forget what it takes to harvest acres of land.

""I think a lot of people are not cognizant of what it takes to grow the commodities that are necessary to stock the grocery shelves,” Knutson said.

He says although the technology the USDA is testing will not be ready for everyone to use for at least a few years, it begins to give them an idea of what is needed to save water and money."

"State Department officials berated staff, labeled some 'traitors,' report says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/state-department-officials-watchdog-report-political-retaliation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top officials in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs subjected employees to ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" accusations of disloyalty, and retaliation, a long-awaited report from the department's watchdog agency found. The report also said the bureau's leadership ""did not take significant action"" to address these concerns.

""Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,"" according to the report released Thursday by the State Department Office of Inspector General.

The bureau's leaders labeled some employees ""traitors,"" if they felt they didn't support President Donald Trump. They berated others for following procedures, punished staff for not doing work the department's Office of the Legal Adviser had deemed ""inappropriate"" and targeted others for retaliation, in one case because of a staffer's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community.""

'Six to eight hostile interactions per day'

""Although some IO employees reported that they had never witnessed Assistant Secretary Moley or Ms. Stull behave unprofessionally, the majority of employees OIG interviewed either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others,"" the report said. ""In fact, one IO employee told OIG that working with Ms. Stull involved 'six to eight hostile interactions per day.'""

Stull left the department in January 2019 ; Moley remains in his post. Moley participated in an interview with the OIG, but Stull declined.

The report cited numerous examples of Stull and Moley berating employees for following established department procedures for tasks ranging from sending briefings to booking travel accommodations.

'Inappropriate accusations of disloyalty'

Stull and Moley also ""made inappropriate accusations of disloyalty and made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views,"" according to the report.

""For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' or 'disloyal,'"" the report said. ""Other career employees told OIG that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the 'Deep State' and that the Assistant Secretary accused them of 'undermining the President's agenda.'""

In one instance, the report noted, Stull ""expressed displeasure"" with a legislative affairs employee accompanying a delegation of the Congressional Black Caucus ""because it consisted of only Democratic members."" Stull accused the employee ""of trying to 'thwart' President Trump and undermine his agenda"" and many of the employee's job responsibilities were reassigned. That employee eventually left the State Department.

Retaliation

Moley and Stull retaliated against other employees as well, according to the report. Moley removed a principal deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, after she raised concerns about Stull's treatment of employees and conflict of interest.

Moley ""told the PDAS that he did not believe that her concerns about Ms. Stull were valid"" and ""it was obvious to him that she had problems working with Ms. Stull and that, therefore, the PDAS should be prepared to leave the bureau,"" according to the report.

In another instance, the OIG found that Moley had canceled the selection process for a deputy director position in order to support Stull's move to block the leading candidate for that post. Stull did not like the candidate's work with the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees -- a point which Moley confirmed to the OIG. Stull also reportedly had a problem with that candidate's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community,"" according to the report.

She criticized two career employees ""whom she believed had been insufficiently supportive of her position"" in a work dispute stemming from her time at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. She also attempted to remove work responsibilities from one of those employees for failing to assist her, despite the fact that what she had asked them to do was deemed ""inappropriate"" by the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Failure to address concerns

Despite concerns raised by both IO employees and State Department management, Moley did little to address them, according to the report. Moley told OIG ""that no employees had 'ever' raised concerns with him regarding morale or treatment of employees.""

However, the report said he had conversations with two undersecretaries in April and on June 13, 2018, and with Deputy Secretary John Sullivan on June 25, 2018 regarding the issues raised about his bureau. In each, he was advised to address the misbehavior.

In the June 13 meeting, he was directed to take several steps -- let all IO employees know about his commitment to inclusion, develop a staffing plan to address two IO departures, ensure that Stull had recused herself from all activities related to her prior work at the UN, and direct her to stop ""all further public engagement"" criticizing State Department employees.

Although Moley took some of these steps, the misconduct continued. The report noted that OIG continued to receive reports about ""hostile treatment of employees, allegations of disloyalty, and conflicts of interest"" throughout the course of its review.

'We won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended'

The watchdog recommended in its report that the State Department ""develop a corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" in IO within 60 days. It also noted the department should consider whether to take disciplinary action for the conduct described in the 34-page document. The State Department agreed with both of these recommendations, the report said.

Thursday's report presented the findings of one of two OIG investigations into political retaliation at the department. It was opened in June 2018 after members of Congress expressed concern to the State Department about allegations of Stull's vetting of career employees were reported by Foreign Policy Magazine.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel said Thursday that the report ""confirms what we feared: 'disrespectful and hostile' treatment of career employees at the State Department."" The New York Democrat urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fire Moley.

""There is more to come, and I hope it comes very soon. The delays from the Department on this matter have been frustrating. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is conducting an independent inquiry on these matters, and we won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences,"" Engel said in a statement."
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.63% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, -2.92% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.12% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.95% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
Charges filed in shooting of 6 Philadelphia officers,https://www.readingeagle.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/charges-filed-in-shooting-of-6-philadelphia-officers,"Saturday August 17, 2019 05:34 PM

The event was the largest mass shooting of Philadelphia police officers in decades.

PHILADELPHIA — Attempted murder charges were filed Saturday against Maurice Hill for allegedly shooting six police officers during a standoff Wednesday that lasted more than seven hours, and four others connected to what police have described as Hill's drug operation were charged, as well.

Hill, 36, was denied bail and appeared at his preliminary arraignment Saturday morning via video conference while he was being held at a Philadelphia Police investigative unit in South Philadelphia. After the hearing, Hill was transferred to Curran Fromhold Correctional Facility, jail records show.

In addition to attempted murder, Hill faces multiple counts of aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer and other drug and firearm possession charges. District Attorney Larry Krasner said last week that Hill could spend the rest of his life in prison. A representative from the Defender Association of Philadelphia argued on his behalf.

Hill appeared defiant Saturday morning, sitting with his arms crossed and head down. He responded, “I guess,” when the magistrate asked if he understood the charges against him, and then said, “I am not an immediate danger,” after a prosecutor argued he should remain in custody and be denied bail.

Four other men were charged with drug offenses Saturday in connection with the standoff, two of whom were trapped in the house along with Hill and two Philadelphia police officers. Those two men are Terrence Williams, 32, and Ronald Ellis, 37, who were each charged with drug possession with intent to deliver and conspiracy. Bail was set at $500,000.

Two other men, Dwayne Turner, 31, and Raynell Rodgers, 30, also face charges of drug possession with intent to deliver and conspiracy but weren't in the house during the standoff with police. Preliminary hearings were scheduled for early September.

Police said Hill, who has an extensive criminal history, on Wednesday afternoon opened fire on police who were serving a warrant in a nearby house and then barricaded himself in a home on the 3700 block of North 15th Street in the city's Tioga section. Investigators believe Hill used an AR-15-style assault rifle and had a handgun in his pocket when he surrendered just after midnight.

Witnesses who live on the block said they heard hundreds of shots fired over the course of the lengthy standoff.

Running with bag

Assistant District Attorney Lyandra Retacco said Saturday during arraignment hearings that police Wednesday spotted Williams running with a black plastic bag from 3712 N. 15th St., where police were executing a search warrant, into 3716 N. 15th St., where the standoff then ensued. Records show Williams co-owns the latter home.

Retacco said Ellis, Turner and Rodgers were each observed by police, who surveilled the area for days, taking part in suspected drug activity, including escorting people in and out of the property.

On Thursday, police identified the officers who suffered injuries as Joshua Burkitt, 26, of the 24th District; Michael Guinter, 32, of the Narcotics Strike Force; Nathaniel Harper, 43, also of the Narcotics Strike Force; Justin Matthews, 31, of the 16th District; Shaun Parker, 32, of the Narcotics Strike Force; and Ryan Waltman, 42, of the 39th District.

"New evidence shows why Steele, the Ohrs and TSA workers never should have become DOJ sources",https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/457628-new-evidence-shows-why-steele-the-ohrs-and-tsa-workers-never-should-have,"One of the inevitable outcomes of the Russia case will be that the Department of Justice (DOJ) almost certainly will need internal reforms.

The first reform is the most obvious, given the unraveling of the Russia collusion narrative: a new set of rules governing when the FBI can investigate or spy on a First Amendment-protected political campaign during an election.

The second reform may be less visible but becomes painfully obvious, thanks to a series of internal DOJ investigative memos released this month that expose glaring issues with the handling, vetting and weighting of “confidential human sources.” That’s a fancy term for people — sometimes called “snitches” or informants, in street vernacular — who secretly provide evidence to law enforcement.

Some examples of the DOJ’s problems with informers fall outside the Russia case but mirror the same issues unmasked in the now-debunked probe of Trump.

Take, for example, the DOJ inspector general’s finding this month that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was paying other government officials at the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to work as informants.

The IG spared few words in decrying the idiocy of allowing government security officers collecting a federal salary to double-dip into taxpayers’ money by receiving informant pay to report criminal activity they were required by their jobs to disclose.

Two agents and one supervisor “violated the DEA Confidential Source policy” by paying three TSA workers as informants, the report concluded. And one agent wrongly served as handler for a TSA informant with whom he was involved in a “personal relationship,” investigators found, exposing a problem dating to 2013.

“By establishing the TSA employees as paid Limited Use Confidential Sources, the DEA agreed to pay for information that the TSA employees were already obligated to provide to law enforcement,” the IG concluded.

In other words, there should be a bright line: Government agents should stick to their jobs and leave the informing to private citizens.

That line similarly was breached in the minds of many when Bruce Ohr, then the DOJ’s assistant deputy attorney general, began collecting anti-Trump information on July 30, 2016, from former MI6 agent Steele and pushing it on the top levels of the DOJ and the FBI.

At the time, Ohr knew his wife, Nellie, and Steele worked for the Fusion GPS research firm on the same project to dig up Russia dirt on Trump, to help the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) win the 2016 election. Furthermore, Ohr told the FBI he knew Steele was a foreigner “desperate” to stop a Trump presidency, FBI memos show.

With his seniority inside DOJ, Ohr quickly got Steele’s information to the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and three top DOJ supervisors, despite the red flags.

Before long, Steele was working as a confidential informant for the bureau, and his dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant targeting the Trump campaign weeks before Election Day.

When Steele got fired Nov. 1, 2016, by the FBI for leaking to the media, Ohr became a conduit for the bureau to keep getting information from Steele for months. Ohr met at least 12 times in late 2016 and 2017 with FBI agents to provide new intel from the British spy. In other words, Ohr transitioned from being a DOJ supervisor to a backdoor source for the FBI to receive information from a terminated source.

And he didn’t stop there.

Records released this week, thanks to litigation by the conservative group Judicial Watch, show the senior DOJ official took at least two research files from his wife and her Fusion GPS work and provided them to FBI agents investigating Trump. One alleged that unverified ties existed between the Trump organization and Russian mobsters; the other provided a timeline alleging wrongdoing by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Nellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of her anti-Trump information came from foreign officials in Ukraine, including a parliamentary member highly critical of Manafort.

Examination of the Nellie Ohr documents given to the FBI shows some of her source material also came from former Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawsuit she filed against Manafort.

Why is that significant? Tymoshenko and Hillary Clinton had a simpatico relationship after the former secretary of State went out of her way in January 2013 to advocate for Tymoshenko’s release from prison on corruption charges.

So, Bruce Ohr became a conduit of information not only for intelligence from Clinton’s British opposition-researcher but also from his wife’s curation of evidence from a Clinton foreign ally and Manafort enemy inside Ukraine. Talk about foreign influence in a U.S. election!

To Ohr’s credit, he disclosed his potential conflict of interest involving his wife to DOJ officials. To DOJ’s discredit, he was allowed to act as a source for both his wife and Steele anyway.

Ohr also didn’t get compensated as a paid informant, like the TSA workers. But documents show a curious thing happened during the time he began peddling the anti-Trump intelligence from his wife and Steele: His annual performance bonus doubled from about $14,000 in November 2015 to $28,000 in November 2016.

The blurred line between government official and informer/source didn’t stop with Ohr. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker also admitted he took dirt on Trump from DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann in summer 2016 and gave it to the agents investigating the Trump campaign.

The ultimate consequence — some might argue folly — of all these blurred lines is most easily exposed in an often overlooked document from the Russia probe.

I’ve written that the FBI kept a spreadsheet showing almost all of what Steele provided agents and Ohr on Russia-Trump dirt turned out to be unverified, disproven or nothing more than internet rumors. But when the FBI closed its paperwork on Steele in 2018, a professional intelligence analyst concluded in his human source validation report that the bureau assessed it had only “medium confidence” in Steele and that his intelligence could only be “minimally” verified.

In other words, his intelligence wasn’t very good. And yet, America spent nearly three years in turmoil only to learn that Steele’s Trump-Russia allegations — paid by Clinton and propagated by Ohr — were not true.

The tales of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele, Yulia Tymoshenko, and those DEA and TSA agents raise a stark warning: The lines between government officials and informants, unverified political dirt and real intelligence, personal interest and law enforcement, became too blurred for the Justice Department’s own good.

That’s a problem sorely in need of fixing.

E.P.A. Backtracks on Use of ‘Cyanide Bombs’ to Kill Wild Animals,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Vigdor'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/epa-cyanide-bombs.html,"The federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday withdrew its support for the continued use of so-called cyanide bombs to protect livestock from predators, reversing course amid strong opposition to the practice.

The E.P.A. administrator, Andrew R. Wheeler, said he was withdrawing an interim reauthorization for the use of M-44 devices, which are used to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals that prey on livestock. The agency, he added, would re-evaluate the highly criticized practice.

“This issue warrants further analysis and additional discussions by E.P.A. with the registrants of this predacide,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement on Thursday. “I look forward to continuing this dialogue to ensure U.S. livestock remain well protected from dangerous predators while simultaneously minimizing off-target impacts on both humans and nonpredatory animals.”

The federal Department of Agriculture, along with its state counterpart agencies in Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have relied on the M-44s for farming since the mid-1970s."
