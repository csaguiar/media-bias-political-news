Trump warns of a 'market crash the likes of which has not been seen before' if he loses 2020 election — but economists are worried he's causing a recession on his own,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Graham Rapier'],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-warns-market-crash-if-not-re-elected-2020-trade-war-wages-on-2019-6,"United States President Donald Trump on Saturday warned without evidence of a massive market crash if he's not re-elected in 2020.

""The Trump Economy is setting records, and has a long way up to go,"" he said. ""However, if anyone but me takes over in 2020 (I know the competition very well), there will be a Market Crash the likes of which has not been seen before! KEEP AMERICA GREAT).""

The stock market, a close but far from perfect measure for some aspects of the economy's health, are indeed up about 27% since the President's inauguration on January 20, 2017, but those gains have been mired by massive sell offs sparked by trade war fears amid tariff fights with China, Mexico, and other countries.

Leading economists, meanwhile, are warning more trade disputes could unfurl economic gains from even before Trump's election. But even professionals struggle to forecast when — and why — economic recessions occur.

""The trade war has so far offset all benefits of fiscal stimulus and, if continued, may lead to global recession,"" Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, said on Thursday.

""If this recession materializes, historians might call it the 'Trump recession' given that it would be largely caused by the trade war initiative.""

Beyond Wall Street, businesses are worried too. On Thursday, 600 companies sent a joint letter to Trump saying that broader tariffs on China would hurt workers and consumers.

Consumers share their fears too.

A closely-watched gauge of consumer sentiment fell to 97.9 at the beginning of the month from 100 in May, the University of Michigan's consumer survey indicated Friday, compared with expectations for a reading of 99.

""Consumers responded by lowering growth prospects for the national economy, and as a consequence, reduced the expected gains in employment,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, said of tariffs.

Saturday's warning is far from the first time Trump has attempted to forecast an economic downturn in the event he loses the presidency.

In August 2018, he told Bloomberg News: ""If I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash. I think everybody would be very poor. Because without this thinking you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe, in reverse."""
Mexico releases full text of migration agreement that Trump inadvertently flashed to cameras,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexico-releases-text-migration-agreement-trump-flashed,"Mexico on Friday released a copy of a supplementary agreement to stop migrant flows into the U.S. -- days after Trump inadvertently flashed parts of the deal to cameras.

The June 7 deal will require migrants moving to the border via Mexico to seek asylum there, and for Mexico to identify changes in domestic law to implement the agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The agreement also calls for discussions to establish “definitive terms for a binding bilateral agreement to further address burden-sharing and the assignment of responsibility for processing refugee status claims of migrants.”

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The language is close to that of a “safe third country” agreement that the U.S. has been seeking that means migrants entering Mexico apply for asylum there rather than the U.S. Mexico has resisted such a designation.

The agreement includes a clause by which, if the U.S. determines that the measures adopted by Mexico have not achieved sufficient results in preventing migrant flows after 45 days, then “Mexico will take all necessary steps under domestic law to bring the agreement into force.”

Trump had flashed a folded copy of the deal to reporters this week, and said it’s “the agreement that everybody says I don’t have.” Photojournalists, however, were able to see through the paper and glimpse part of the agreement.

TRUMP RAISES SPECTER OF IMPOSING 'VERY PROFITABLE' NEW TARIFFS ON MEXICO DESPITE DEAL BREAKTHROUGH

The supplementary deal’s release comes a week after Trump announced that the two countries had reached an agreement to prevent U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico taking tougher measures on migrant flows -- that have increased significantly in recent months to well over 100,000 a month.

According to a joint declaration issued by the State Department and Mexico last week, Mexico will take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border.”

The U.S. will also expand its “Remain-in Mexico” policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. committed to accelerate asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles.”

“Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!” Trump said last Saturday.

According to the Journal, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said this week that it is seeking a multilateral solution to the crisis, and will begin working with several U.N. agencies beginning next week.

“This isn’t just a Mexican issue, not just an issue for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, it’s one of the biggest migration flows in the world,” he said."
President Donald Trump Tweetstorm – The Saturday Edition,https://deadline.com,['Bruce Haring'],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://deadline.com/2019/06/president-donald-trump-tweetstorm-the-saturday-edition-32-1202633172/,"President Donald Trump is gearing up for a big announcement of his 2020 election campaign on Tuesday in Florida. But he’s warming up in the bullpen via to fire up his base in advance of the official announcement.

In a line reminiscent of New York Times columnist Paul Krugman’s prediction about the market’s direction in the wake of Trump’s 2016 victory (a prediction which ultimately proved totally wrong), the President noted that Democrats carry the same potential if they supplant him.

State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

Sean Hannity: Sources say DOJ inspector general resolved 'hang up' on first Carter Page FISA application,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-doj-inspector-general-resolved-hang-up-on-first-carter-page-fisa-application,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses may have hit a snag examining the first Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

During his evening show on Thursday, Hannity explained how Inspector General Michael Horowitz worked around the issue, which was related to British ex-spy Christopher Steele and his dossier, and may have already submitted his report to the attorney general.

""From my understanding, my sources, is inspector general Horowitz is probably likely done,"" Hannity said, adding, ""I’ve had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report.""

He was interviewing the Hill's John Solomon and credited memos obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation and first reported by Solomon with aiding the watchdog investigation reach a breakthrough.

The memos showed Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11, 2016 and admitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

""Now there was apparently, originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly that being the first,"" Hannity said. ""But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned,"" he added, referring to Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who acted as an unofficial back channel between the Steele and the FBI.

Steele's dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had just left the Trump campaign and had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

Hannity's reporting follows Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, saying last month that Horowitz's team determined the three FISA warrant extensions against Page were illegally obtained.

Although Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June, Solomon said his own sources and Rep. Mark Meadows, have made it clear that the FISA investigation will take longer than expected to wrap up, particularly after Steele offered himself up for an interview with the inspector general.

""Not a long time, a short while,"" Solomon said, adding that he thinks the American people will see the report sometime in the summer."

In response to the special counsel’s report, Democrats are piecing together a package of legislation focused largely on shielding elections from foreign influence, including proposals to bar candidates from accepting foreign help of any kind, while making it mandatory that campaigns alert the FBI when such offers are extended.

But some lawmakers want to press further, eying legislation to nullify the Department of Justice's (DOJ) long-standing determination that presidents cannot be charged with federal crimes while they remain in office.

“It's definitely on the menu,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollySwing-state Democrats see trouble in proposed pay hike Swing-state Democrats see trouble in proposed pay hike Seven key allies for Pelosi on impeachment MORE (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. “I'm in favor of expanding enforcement tools and accountability tools, and that's definitely one of them.”

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesDem committees win new powers to investigate Trump Dem committees win new powers to investigate Trump Steyer group targeting 12 congressional Democrats over impeachment MORE (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is also signaling his support. While he has not been involved in talks about specific proposals, Jeffries said, “It strikes me as a reasonable thing to consider.”

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” he said.

It's unclear how or when the proposal might surface. Connolly said it could appear as part of a larger spending package or as an authorization bill out of the House Judiciary Committee. “But I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” he said.

At issue is a Justice Department policy stretching back 46 years, when former President Nixon was coming under increasing fire surrounding a Watergate scandal that would eventually lead to his impeachment and resignation. In that 1973 memorandum, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) resolved that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution for federal crimes.

The rationale hinged on bandwidth. The president's unique responsibilities, the authors determined, “have become so onerous that a President may not be able fully to discharge the powers and duties of his office if he had to defend a criminal prosecution.” With that in mind, the OLC concluded, the only way to remove a sitting president is through impeachment.

The DOJ revisited the question in 2000, following the impeachment of former President Clinton, finding that “the conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.”

Mueller leaned heavily on that policy last month in outlining his findings during a brief appearance at the DOJ, where he made clear the agency’s guidelines precluded his team from recommending charges against Trump related to the obstruction allegations it had investigated.

“The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and, by regulation, it was bound by that department policy,” he said. “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”

Democrats were quick to punch back, arguing that no one — not even the president — is immune to the nation’s laws.

“Quoting the president, ‘I could shoot somebody, and my followers wouldn't leave me.’ Does that mean the president could get away with murder?” asked Rep.

They had just ousted a king who flaunted that.”

Quigley said legislation to invalidate the DOJ policy is “a great idea.”

Such a bill has little chance of being considered in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's Republican allies. But some Democrats see it as a viable messaging tool heading into the 2020 elections.

“If I were a Republican member of the Senate, I wouldn't want to have to explain why the president is not subject to the laws of the United States,” said Rep. Dan Kildee Daniel (Dan) Timothy KildeeDemocratic lawmaker says Trump isn't 'leaving us any choice' on impeachment Democratic lawmaker says Trump isn't 'leaving us any choice' on impeachment On The Money: Judge rules banks can give Trump records to House | Mnuchin pegs debt ceiling deadline as 'late summer' | Democrats see momentum in Trump tax return fight | House rebukes Trump changes to consumer agency MORE (D-Mich.).

Warren's idea is catching on with Democrats in the Capitol, who have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration's stonewalling of their investigations.

“If you believe that no one is above the law, then she is right,” said Rep. Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeDemocrats set stage for next shutdown fight with wall-free spending bill Democrats set stage for next shutdown fight with wall-free spending bill Lee, Sanders introduce bill to tax Wall Street transactions MORE (D-Calif.). “It needs to happen.”

Not all Democrats, however, are so eager to jump on board. Rep. Maxine Waters Maxine Moore WatersLawmakers battle over HUD protections for homeless transgender people Lawmakers battle over HUD protections for homeless transgender people Criticism punctuates Nadler's leadership of Trump probe MORE (D-Calif.) questioned the effectiveness of such a law since it would require officials within the president's own Justice Department to prosecute their boss.

“That's why you have impeachment,” she said. “Because when the president is unfit — and it doesn't have to be criminal — when the Congress decides that he's not fit to be president, then that's what impeachment is for. That's what we're supposed to do.”

Rep. Ro Khanna Rohit (Ro) KhannaCongress must use upcoming defense bills to guard against a confrontation with Iran Congress must use upcoming defense bills to guard against a confrontation with Iran House Democrats push to raise intern pay to per hour MORE (D-Calif.) is also approaching the idea skeptically, warning of “a situation like Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonFormer Senate Dem leader: 'No way' impeachment trial for Trump would lead to conviction Former Senate Dem leader: 'No way' impeachment trial for Trump would lead to conviction Pelosi: House Democrats 'not even close' to backing impeachment MORE's, [where] there was an overzealous prosecutor.” Khanna said Democrats should first conduct hearings to examine the advantages and drawbacks of such a change.

“There's an old saying that bad facts make bad law,” he said. “And I'd be careful of making sweeping legal decisions based on Trump's conduct.”

Still, there appear to be no divisions among the Democrats when it comes to the idea that the Constitution provides no license for presidents to flout the law with impunity.

And that may just be the start.

Trump has challenged enough conventions, many Democrats say, that Congress will be forced to enshrine new laws that were previously thought unnecessary — including the voiding of the OLC guideline — even if it’s after he's gone.

The real reason Trump won't put Harriet Tubman on $20 bill,https://www.cnn.com,['Dorothy Brown'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/opinions/harriet-tubman-trump-race-brown/index.html,"Dorothy A. Brown is a law professor at Emory University. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) President Donald Trump wants NASA to go to Mars, but his Treasury secretary can't figure out how to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill?

Dorothy A. Brown

We recently learned that the planned Harriet Tubman currency — which was slated to replace the $20 Andrew Jackson bill in time for the 2020 centennial of the 19th Amendment — can't be rolled out until 2028. This, even though the engraving plate for it was completed ""as recently as May 2018"" a Treasury Department employee told the New York Times. The employee also said the design ""appeared to be far along in the process,"" according to the Times. Apparently so — as we all saw a picture of it leaked to the press.

Pay no attention to that, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has indicated. There are technical difficulties and they will persist until long after President Trump leaves office, he tells us. We'll pause here to note that the plan for the Tubman bill originated with Trump's predecessor, the first black President of the United States. President Barack Obama referred to Harriet Tubman — an abolitionist who led enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad — as ""an American hero ... [who] fought tirelessly for the Union cause, for the rights of enslaved people, for the rights of women, and for the rights of all.""

In 2016, candidate Trump told NBC that stripping his favorite president, the populist and slave owner, Andrew Jackson, from the $20 bill was "" pure political correctness ."" He suggested that Tubman be bumped to the $2 bill, which is no longer printed.

In the scheme of things, this is not the worst thing the President or his administration has done to disrespect a source of black pride, but it is telling. This President's belief in white supremacy knows no bounds and perhaps a better descriptor would be to start referring to him as our white-supremacist-in-chief."
DOJ audit reveals FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals,https://www.cnn.com,"['Josh Campbell', 'Cnn Law Enforcement Analyst']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/15/politics/fbi-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-ig-report/index.html,"(CNN) The FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals it sponsored for entry into the United States to assist with investigations, the Justice Department's internal watchdog found.

The revelation stems from an audit by the DOJ Office of Inspector General into the department's use of immigration tools that allow law enforcement to sponsor non-US citizens to enter the country without requiring a traditional visa or residency.

This special category of immigration status is often used by the department to permit the entry of cooperating witnesses and confidential informants, who may be required to take part in investigative operations or trial testimony. Many of these individuals would ordinarily be unable to obtain traditional lawful immigration status due to their connections to criminal enterprises.

An agreement with the Department of Homeland Security -- the federal agency charged with conferring immigration status -- requires sponsoring law enforcement agencies assume full responsibility for tracking and monitoring the location and activities of foreign nationals they sponsor for entry.

In its review of the use of these special provisions by Justice Department component agencies, the inspector general found that the FBI was unable to account for at least 61 foreign nationals it sponsored. Furthermore, rather than proactively reporting the total number of those who disappeared, the bureau only notified DHS of 32 individuals no longer under the agency's control.

Buttigieg: Justice Dept. should decide any Trump charges post-2020,https://www.politico.com,['Matthew Choi'],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/15/buttigieg-justice-trump-1365849,"Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg did not want the White House dictating the terms of a DOJ investigation. | Scott Olson/Getty Images 2020 elections Buttigieg: Justice Dept. should decide any Trump charges post-2020

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said that if elected, he would leave the Justice Department to operate independently of the White House during any potential criminal investigations into President Donald Trump.

""Nobody is above the law and prosecution decisions should have nothing to do with politics and should come from the DOJ itself, not from the Oval Office,"" Buttigieg told CNN's Jake Tapper in a preview of an interview to be aired Sunday.

Story Continued Below

Buttigieg's remark comes in contrast with his Democratic rival Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who said if she was elected the Justice Department would have ""no choice"" but to charge Trump with obstruction of justice if he were to finish his term without being impeached. Harris, a former California attorney general, told NPR that former special counsel Robert Mueller had essentially set the stage for criminal charges against Trump, and only a Justice Department policy barring prosecuting sitting presidents got in the way.

Harris, along with a chorus of other candidates from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, has called for Trump's impeachment. Buttigieg has also advocated for impeachment inquiries, but focuses more on beating Trump in 2020.

Buttigieg has also called for criminal inquiries into Trump if he finishes his term in 2021 without impeachment, but the South Bend, Ind., mayor did not go so far as to dictate what the conclusion of those inquiries would be. He also told The Atlantic that he would be hesitant to order his attorney general to directly pursue charges against Trump.

""I would want any credible allegation of criminal behavior to be investigated to the fullest,” Buttigieg told The Atlantic on Wednesday.

Trump has also recently come under fire for telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that if a foreign agent were to offer him dirt on an opponent, he would hear it out. Buttigieg told CBS' Margaret Brennan in an interview segment published Saturday that any American who receives foreign election help should ""just call the FBI"".

""And by the way, this isn't hypothetical. This isn't theoretical,"" Buttigieg said, referring to Russian offers of opposition information to members of Trump's inner circle in 2016.

"A President With a Taste for Planes Has a Plan for Air Force One: Paint It Red, White and Blue",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-paint-job.html,"WASHINGTON — As someone who fancies himself an aviation expert — he did once have his own airline, after all — President Trump indulged his interest this week in a number of ways.

He ordered an F-35, a (very loud) $80 million fighter jet, to fly over the White House during the visit of the president of Poland. He stood on the South Lawn watching the landing of a pricey new VH-92 helicopter, which is referred to as Marine One when he is aboard. And in maybe his most satisfying moments of the week, he detailed his plans to give Air Force One — perhaps the most famous plane in the world — a new paint job.

“I like the concept of red, white and blue,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, describing the makeover he envisions for the plane, a specially fitted Boeing 747 with iconic cyan and white coloring. “The baby blue doesn’t fit with us.”

For other presidents, all of this would have amounted to a few too many aeronautical activities to stuff into a week packed with mounting aggression toward Iran, tariff threats and a head-of-state visit. Not for this one. In fact, it’s hard not to think that this sort of sky-toy-packed schedule is closer to what Mr. Trump, with his peculiar fixation with all things aviation, originally envisioned for his presidency."

DOJ establishes transnational elder fraud strike force,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-establishes-transnational-elder-fraud-strike-force/story?id=63714167,"The Justice Department has formed a transnational elder fraud strike force to combat the growing international problem of elder fraud.

Elder fraud is when fraudsters prey on older victims who can be more susceptible to when approached to give money to sympathetic causes and in some cases threatened and harassed by criminals.

Recently, three Peruvian men pleaded guilty to extorting older Americans through a Spanish-speaking call center.

""For example, one such script directed the callers to falsely and fraudulently claim to be government attorneys and to state that the victims faced lawsuits and fines for not paying for or receiving packages. Other scripts included similar stories where the callers falsely claimed to be attorneys with courts or credit bureaus in the United States,"" the indictment in the case reads.

The effort, announced Thursday, combines six U.S. Attorney's offices from California to Georgia, FBI Special Agents and the Postal Inspection Agency -- all in an effort to combat elder fraud in the United States.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a release. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes. The new Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force will bring together the expertise and resources of our prosecutors, federal and international law enforcement partners, and other government agencies to better target, investigate, and prosecute criminals abroad who prey on our elderly at home. The Department of Justice is committed to ending the victimization of elders across the country.”

Earlier this year, the attorney general announced the largest ever crackdown on elder fraud in country by highlighting the case of William Webster, the former FBI director who was targeted for months by scammers abroad.

“It doesn’t matter where these criminals live. We’re committed to keeping our elderly citizens safe, whether they’re being targeted door-to-door, over the phone, or online, from thousands of miles away,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.

Barr has said that he had been a victim of one of the scams in 2017. While he was not attorney general at the time, fraudsters asked for money using his old official portrait.

He highlighted his story at a roundtable event in March.

""People took my official Justice Department portrait from 1992, so I was looking pretty good in 1992 and they put it up on Facebook and other online sites and I was telling people as the former attorney general I had access to special federal grant money and if they just sent some money I could tell them how to get some major grants,"" he explained.

Barr said he had the pages taken down, but from time to time even leading up to when he was nominated to be attorney general he would get calls from people around the country which he called ""heartbreaking."""
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"
DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

​

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment, filed as part of the annual defense policy bill, would put pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The EPA said it would not comment on pending legislation.

The compromise measure from a bipartisan group of senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee provides an early glimpse at how Congress plans to address the issue this year.

The EPA currently recommends no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own drinking water standards that are tougher than what the EPA currently recommends.

Attempting to force the EPA to set a standard would likely meet resistance from some Republicans.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several GOP lawmakers said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response.

But other Republicans argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

Carper has been pushing to designate PFAS a hazardous substance under the Superfund law as a way to force responsible parties to clean up the chemical.

In some cases, that party would be the military itself, which has identified more than 400 military sites with suspected PFAS contamination."
Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Burgess Everett', 'Nancy Cook', 'John Bresnahan']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/usda-kansas-city-area-1529072,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture."" | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images Agriculture Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has chosen to relocate two of USDA's research agencies to the Kansas City area, the final step in a process to reshape the department's research wing that has drawn objections from several congressional Democrats.

Perdue said in announcing the new home of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture on Thursday that the move would bring the research agencies closer to major farming regions, improve customer service and save taxpayer dollars — about $20 million per year over 15 years.

Story Continued Below

But many employees at ERS, who conduct research into areas such as climate change, nutrition and the farm economy, and at NIFA, who arrange federal grants for agricultural research institutions, have told POLITICO they believe the move is rooted in politics.

Several current and former staffers at the agencies have warned that relocation could disrupt operations and drive out experienced researchers. The proposal has already sparked a brain-drain of veteran economists from ERS, and some lawmakers and ERS staff allege relocation is a back-door attempt to shrink the agency and clamp down on research that doesn't align with the Trump administration's priorities.

Democrats have questioned the relocation plan and blamed USDA for not providing detailed justification since the concept was first unveiled in August 2018. The House USDA-FDA appropriations bill for fiscal 2020 would prohibit USDA from moving forward with the relocation, but the measure is unlikely to become law before the move is carried out.

Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture” and already boasts a “significant presence” of USDA and federal government employees, in addition to the Kansas City Federal Reserve.

“The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers,” he said.

“This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future,” he added.

The department has not settled on a location in the Kansas City area. The General Services Administration will release a proposal early next month, allowing interested parties to submit bids, Perdue said Thursday afternoon. In the meantime, employees will be relocated as soon as mid-July and will be placed in temporary office space that fits up to 200 workers.

USDA has argued since the relocation proposal was first announced that the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area hinders recruitment and retention at the agencies.

The anticipated savings of $20 million per year will allow more funding to be directed to research initiatives to address “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” Perdue said, adding that the savings will also enable the agencies to maintain service and staffing “even in the face of tightening budgets.”

State and local governments sweetened the deal by offering a package of $26 million in incentives, the secretary said. Perdue refused to reveal what the Kansas City region offered to attract USDA.

""These are proprietary discussions from our perspective,"" he told reporters. ""If the local community chooses to disclose those, they can do so at their will.""

The total savings of the projected move — about $300 million over 15 years — is based on a cost-benefit analysis of relocation to the Kansas City area that the department released on Thursday. Several congressional Democrats have called on the department for months to release such a study.

In announcing the pick, USDA backed down on another element of its plan that had drawn pushback from lawmakers — moving ERS within the department's organizational structure so that it would fall under the Office of the Chief Economist. The agency will remain under the department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area.

""While we believe there is considerable synergies and benefits to a realignment, after hearing feedback from stakeholders and members of Congress, USDA will not move forward with the realignment plans,"" the release said.

Critics of that part of the plan, including several current and former ERS employees interviewed by POLITICO, argued the realignment could subject the agency's research to political influence by positioning it closer to the Office of the Secretary. The House fiscal 2020 spending bill for USDA had sought to block the realignment.

The Kansas City region was selected from a pool of more than 130 locations that had expressed interest in hosting the agencies. Now, the move is on a fast-track timeline.

Agency employees are expected to receive relocation letters on Thursday. Employees anticipate being given 30 days to decide whether to move, according to union leaders.

Employees of both agencies have voted to unionize in the face of the relocation, and leaders at the American Federation of Government Employees, which is representing the workers, have vowed to press for a delay.

Union representatives said employees were not given advance notice of the announcement — something Perdue said on Wednesday he would do. They learned of the site selection through media reports, according to union leaders.

During a town hall briefing following the announcement, nearly 20 employees silently protested Perdue by turning their backs to him while he addressed staff.

""Secretary Perdue continually speaks of transparency and communicating to employees but has failed on both fronts,"" said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of the ERS union. ""The announcement today highlights his disregard for the rights and wellbeing of employees.""

In a letter to employees shared with POLITICO, Perdue said he knows ""that this time, especially for the employees directly affected, has been personally and professionally challenging. I am grateful for your patience and your continued hard work.""

The secretary said he wrote the letter because he wanted employees to hear the news from him first. But a notice containing the letter was not distributed among staff until 10:37 a.m. Thursday — well after media reports were published and Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) had hailed the decision in a press release.

The four U.S. senators from Missouri and Kansas — all Republicans — issued a joint statement praising Perdue for selecting the Kansas City area. One of them, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), said that ""agricultural research is a critical function of USDA, and I am committed to ensuring we continue to support and strengthen the research mission that our U.S. producers rely on.""

But some Democrats from other parts of the country were critical of the decision.

Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.), who lead House Agriculture subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the USDA research agencies, criticized Thursday's announcement and said the entire process has lacked transparency.

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a House Appropriations Committee member who co-sponsored a bill to stop the move, said she was ""appalled"" with USDA's decision to force ""staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods.""

She also noted that a USDA Inspector General investigation ""examining the viability of this relocation is not complete.""

USDA paid the consulting firm Ernst & Young $340,000 to run the site selection process.

Gillibrand says she wouldn't stand in way if her DOJ wanted to investigate Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paul Steinhauser', 'Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gillibrand-wont-stand-in-way-if-her-justice-department-wanted-to-investigate-trump,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says if elected to the White House, she wouldn’t stand in the way if her Department of Justice wanted to investigate Donald Trump for obstruction of justice.

And the senator from New York told Fox News on Friday that she believes the Republican president’s alleged obstruction of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation “amounts to a crime.”

“As president of the United States, I will restore what’s been lost and that is an independent Department of Justice. They would be able to make that decision independent of me as president,” she said, while campaigning in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.

She becomes the latest 2020 Democratic candidate to at least open the door to a Trump prosecution once he's out of office.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said this week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

HARRIS SAYS IF ELECTED, HER DOJ WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PROSECUTE TRUMP

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said this week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

But Buttigieg added that he would only take such a step if there was a “credible allegation.”

Mueller spent two years investigating any possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia to sway the election toward the GOP nominee at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In his recent report, Mueller detailed extensive contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. And he didn’t take a clear position on whether the president obstructed justice. Trump himself, in an interview with ABC News, disputed a central allegation from his former White House counsel that he tried to have Mueller removed.

Asked by Fox News whether she believed Trump deserved to be investigated, Gillibrand answered: “Do I believe what he’s done already amounts to a crime? I do.”

And she emphasized that “the American people, no matter what, are entitled to facts, transparency, and accountability.”

Another Democratic presidential candidate, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, disagrees with his rivals.

“If you look around the world, one pattern that America should seek to avoid is prosecuting past leaders and presidents and imprisoning them,"" Yang told Fox News on Thursday. ""That’s something that America has never fallen into and that’s the way I would hope that we proceed with me in the White House.”

Trump, meanwhile, has fired back at Democrats accusing him of a crime -- especially after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week she wants to see him in prison. Speaking Friday to ""Fox & Friends,"" he called her accusation of a ""criminal coverup"" a ""fascist"" and ""disgraceful"" statement."

Columnist

The Trump administration presents a series of unanswerable moral riddles. What’s worse — President Trump’s outrageous acts? His gaslighting? His followers’ eagerness to join him in coverups and lies? All three were on display this week, as they have been pretty much every week since Jan 20, 2017.

First, the misconduct: Having claimed that he did not collude with Russia in 2016, Trump now proudly advertises his willingness to collude with any foreign government in the future. If a regime offered him useful information, he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, “Oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”

“I would not have thought that I needed to say this,” responded Ellen L. Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission: “It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.”

Next came the gaslighting. Trump indignantly tweeted: “I meet and talk to ‘foreign governments’ every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about ‘Everything!’ Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again. With that being said, my full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media. They purposely leave out the part that matters.”

Actually, the media didn’t leave out any part of his answer. It was the president who, in his ham-handed attempt at cleanup, left out the truth. Stephanopoulos wasn’t asking him whether, as president, it was proper for him to have diplomatic exchanges with foreign heads of state. He was asking whether Trump, as a candidate, would accept help from a foreign government. So Trump is, as usual, throwing out absurdities and falsehoods to distract from what he said and to give his followers — some cynical, others credulous — an excuse to claim that it was all fake news.

Trump’s trucklers did not disappoint. On Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show, Victor Davis Hanson of the Hoover Institution said the lesson was that “you shouldn’t ever talk to George Stephanopoulos,” and Ingraham was perturbed that someone (perhaps a 400-pound coach potato?) put Trump “in that situation — I don’t get it.” On “Fox & Friends,” co-host Ainsley Earhardt said it was ridiculous for Trump to report foreign assistance to the FBI: “What’s the FBI going to do?” Uh, stop the election interference?

A common trope among the Trumpkins was that criticism of their idol for making use of foreign election assistance was hypocritical because, as Sean Hannity argued: “Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier for the Russian lies.” This whataboutism was echoed by the likes of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who should be smart enough to know better.

In reality (remember that quaint concept?), there is nothing illegal or unethical about the Clinton campaign paying a U.S. research firm, Fusion GPS, which employed a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who talked to actual Russians to probe Trump’s suspicious Russia links. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee admitted as much: This is standard opposition research. It is not remotely equivalent to the Russian government helping Trump win. It’s actually similar to the Trump campaign hiring Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm. Moreover, Steele did go to the FBI — something that Trump boasts about never having done.

Few Republicans were willing to defend Trump’s egregious comments outright. Instead, they deflected and minimized. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made it sound as if the real problem was Democrats “trying to keep the 2016 election alive.” Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that this was not one of Trump’s “best statements” (please cite Trump’s best statement, Senator), but he praised Trump for his “refreshing habit of saying what he thinks.” I can think of many ways to describe the president bragging about breaking the law, but “refreshing” isn’t one of them. I suppose that’s one reason I’m not a Republican member of Congress.

The final indignity came when Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) led Republicans’ successful effort to block a bill sponsored by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) to require campaigns to disclose any foreign offers of assistance to the FBI. This is of a piece with McConnell blocking a raft of other bills designed to defend U.S. elections from foreign interference. The most benign explanation is that Republicans are afraid of embarrassing Trump and incurring his wrath. The more sinister explanation is that they are secretly rooting for Russian help again in 2020. The two explanations are not, of course, incompatible. Either way, Republicans are putting partisan self-interest above the nation’s interest.

Beyond the issue of foreign election interference, this sordid episode shows how an utterly amoral president in league with power-hungry Republicans and the ratings-driven conservative media-industrial complex has hijacked U.S. politics. Considerations of truth, justice and the national interest are utterly alien to our new overlords. All that matters is “owning” the “libtards” — and enjoying the spoils of power.

House Oversight Committee holds Attorney General Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress,https://www.businessinsider.com,"['Joe Perticone', 'Sonam Sheth']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/house-oversight-william-barr-wilbur-ross-contempt-of-congress-2019-6,"WASHINGTON — The House Oversight and Reform Committee voted on Wednesday to hold Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas relating to the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 US Census, ramping up pressure on more Trump administration officials who are refusing to cooperate with investigations.

Barr had already been the subject of a civil-contempt resolution that passed the House on Tuesday, and Ross marks another cabinet-level official to be reprimanded by House Democrats.

The committee voted 24-15, with Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan as the sole Republican vote in favor of holding Barr and Ross in contempt.

The next steps include a full vote on the House floor. Unlike the civil-contempt vote for Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn that passed on Tuesday, the resolution from the oversight committee includes both civil and criminal contempt.

If the Trump administration wants to avoid the criminal contempt for two cabinet-level officials, they could try to strike a deal with the committee.

Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said in a Monday statement the contempt resolution for Barr and Ross was necessary because the administration has been in engaging in a ""cover-up.""

""I did not want this to happen. I asked Secretary Ross to meet with me personally to try to resolve this impasse, but he refused,"" Cummings said. ""Both Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr are refusing to comply with duly authorized subpoenas from Congress.

""Because they are in contempt of Congress, on Wednesday, the Committee will vote to move forward to enforce our bipartisan subpoenas,"" he added. ""I continue to hope that they will change course and begin producing the information we need to do our job under the Constitution.""

Read more: The House just voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in civil contempt

Wednesday's move comes as Congress faces an unprecedented level of stonewalling from the White House and other executive-branch entities.

In addition to Barr, Ross, and McGahn, the White House has also instructed former White House communications director Hope Hicks and the former McGahn aide Annie Donaldson not to comply with subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee for documents and testimony.

The oversight committee, meanwhile, is in the midst of a court fight with Trump over a subpoena to his accounting firm, Mazars USA, for financial records dating back years. A federal judge ruled last month to allow the subpoena to move forward, prompting the president's lawyers to appeal the ruling.

The Trump Organization is also fighting a joint subpoena to Deutsche Bank from the House intelligence and financial services committees. And the House Ways and Means Committee is engaged in a tug-of-war with the US Treasury Department in an effort to obtain Trump's tax returns. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to hand over the records to Congress, and the move will likely prompt another court fight.

White House counsel Pat Cipollone also recently told the House Judiciary Committee the White House would not comply with a sprawling investigation into various aspects of Trump's dealings — including his campaign, administration, inaugural committee, businesses, and personal finances — because it views the inquiry as an attempt to ""harass"" the president.

But the Justice Department has caved somewhat to mounting political and public pressure. Earlier this month, it agreed to begin turning over 12 categories of counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence documents to the House Intelligence Committee related to the former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

And on Monday, the department agreed to turn over some of the key evidence underlying Mueller's obstruction case to the House Judiciary Committee. The Daily Beast reported, however, that the White House would get to review the evidence first and decide what the committee gets to see."
Overnight Energy: Measure would force EPA to regulate 'forever chemicals' in water | Emails show Trump official consulted climate deniers | Democrats urge Puerto Rico to reject debt deal for power com,https://thehill.com,[],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/overnights/448671-overnight-energy-congress-would-force-epa-to-regulate,"FIRST TAKE ON PFAS: Congress would force the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a drinking water standard for harmful “forever chemicals” under an amendment introduced late Thursday to the defense policy bill.

Known as PFAS, the chemicals are linked with cancer and other health impacts and have contaminated water in at least 43 states. There's been mounting pressure on government officials to address the problem. The persistence in the environment and the human body has earned it the nickname of “forever chemicals.”

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment puts pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The amendment provides an early glimpse at how Congress may address the chemicals this year.

The EPA currently recommends water have no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own more stringent drinking water standards beyond what the EPA currently recommends.

Forcing the EPA to set a standard could prove controversial.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several Republicans said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response to the substance.

But Democrats argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

The Senate amendment would also force EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

TRUMP AND CLIMATE DENIERS: A Trump administration official consulted with advisers to a think tank skeptical of climate change to help challenge widely accepted scientific findings about global warming, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.

William Happer, a member of the National Security Council, made the request to policy advisers with the Heartland Institute this March.

Happer and Heartland Institute adviser Hal Doiron discussed Happer’s scientific arguments in a paper attempting to knock down climate change as well as ideas to make the work “more useful to a wider readership” in a March 3 email exchange.

Happer also said he had discussed the work with another Heartland Institute adviser, Thomas Wysmuller, according to the emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by the Environmental Defense Fund.

The National Security Council declined to comment on the emails.

Pushback: Jim Lakely, interim president of Heartland Institute, told The Hill that the government’s stances on climate change are not above question.

“As for Wysmuller and Doiron, they are unpaid policy advisors and friends of The Heartland Institute and have known Dr. Happer for many years,” he said.

“It would be hard to find a group of men with more qualifications or experience to criticize NASA’s alarmist public statements on the climate than Happer, Doiron, and Wysmuller.”

The Trump administration is reportedly considering creating a new panel headed by Happer to the question the broad scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity and is potentially dangerous.

DEMS DON’T LIKE PUERTO RICO DEAL: Democrats are pushing the Puerto Rican government to reject a debt resettlement deal with the island’s power company, arguing that it will increase Puerto Ricans’ electric bills and stymie development of renewable energy.

A May deal would address the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s (PREPA) $8 billion in debt, pushing the utility to charge customers more to pay off its creditors.

A letter signed by 36 Democrats late Thursday encourages Puerto Rico’s legislative leaders to oppose the deal, which would reduce the utility’s debt by about one-third but raise prices for its customers.

Puerto Ricans already pay almost double the national average for electricity — 22 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 12 cents nationally — and the new deal is expected to raise electric prices by about 20 percent.

“Higher electricity rates are detrimental to the local economy, causing businesses to operate with reduced profit margins, leaving them less able to expand and hire new employees. The new [deal] will accelerate the outmigration of businesses and residents, depleting what is left of Puerto Rico’s economic foundation,” the letter said.

Background: PREPA filed for bankruptcy in July of 2017, but the arrival of Hurricane Maria just months later compounded problems for the struggling utility. More than 1 million Puerto Ricans lost power during and after the storm, many remaining without electricity for months.

Beyond damage to the economy, lawmakers argue the deal backtracks on a pledge to generate more of Puerto Rico’s electricity through renewable sources.

""It's like watching late-night reruns on the cable channels where you've seen all the shows. You know what they're going to say, you laugh at the jokes before they ever get there,"" he said.

""The problem was we just ended up seeing someone yesterday who's trying to re-create his career for 45 years, saying: 'I was part of a corrupt organization. I testified and now I'm going to say everything is worse than what I did.' That's how he's made a living for 45 years.""

House Democrats held a hearing on Capitol Hill Monday and called Watergate whistleblower and CNN contributor John Dean as a witness. Collins questioned the validity of such a hearing and implied Democrats were acting hypocritically.

""Just a few years ago it was brought up and one of our [Republcan] candidates talked about Russia being a threat and the former President, Mr. Obama said ... that the 80s are asking for their foreign policy back. Well guess what, this committee is now hearing from the 70s and they want their star witness back,"" Collins told the committee.

Collins told Fox News he believes Democrats are trying to tie Trump to Nixon in an effort to expedite impeachment proceedings against the Commander-in-Chief.

""Why are [Democrats] bringing in someone, except for star value -- let's be very honest. What they wanted there was -- they wanted the word Nixon and impeachment because they were trying to tie that word to the president,"" he told ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian Kilmeade.

""They cannot find any other way to tie this president to anything else except through innuendo and off candid remarks. So they want the impeachment there so that they think -- they let their base think that they're actually doing something.""

Collins also said House Democrats are desperately trying to appease their base after promising to work tirelessly to remove Trump from office

""So they're trying to help the ones running for president ... and what we're finding out here is that they're going to take little bits and pieces and they're going to say well what about this. But my question to our committee is the Mueller report had unlimited resources, media investigators, grand jury, subpoena options, everything that we don’t have. How is our committee who can’t even seem to get through a hearing yesterday without it looking like a total joke, how are they going to actually investigate better than a Mueller who was fully funded and was after a specific reason?

DOD unveils plans for contractor cybersecurity standards,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Jackson Barnett'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.fedscoop.com/dod-cmmc-new-supply-chain-and-cybersecurity-rules/,"Written by Jackson Barnett

A Department of Defense official unveiled plans Thursday for contractor cybersecurity standards that are scheduled to be implemented by January 2020.

Katie Arrington, special assistant to the assistant secretary of Defense acquisition for cyber, made the announcement along with a plea for the private sector to work with the government to secure its supply chain at a Professional Services Council conference Thursday. The new standards will have a five-level system, and they will combine guidance currently in place from the National Institute of Standards and Technology with new input from the private sector and academia.

The standards, known as Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, will be researched and developed in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. Once in place, third-party private sector companies will audit contractors to ensure compliance. The program also will include an education and training center for cybersecurity.

The level of cybersecurity required by the standards will be indicated on all contract solicitations once implemented.

Defense officials have spoken of the need to develop new contractor cybersecurity standards for more than a year now. Earlier this year, DOD CIO Dana Deasy described how tier-one prime contractors aren’t the big concern.“It’s down when you get to the tier-three and the tier-four” subcontractors.”

“Where the issue breaks down is that as you go down to those various subcontractors, do they understand, [are they] equipped, have the knowledge and the capabilities to defend themselves, and what is it we should be doing more to help them learn how to defend themselves at those tiers?” Deasy said.

Arrington’s announcement was the first look into what to expect when the new standards are implemented. Similarly, in 2017, DOD introduced a regulation that requires all vendors who do business with the department to more safely guard “covered defense information” that is transmitted to or stored in their systems or networks for contracted work.

In addition to speaking about the new rules, Arrington stressed the need for collaboration between public and private sectors to ensure information security.

“It is not a ‘me’ thing, it is a ‘we’ thing,” Arrington said.

The “vast majority” of DOD contractors have ad hoc and inconsistent cybersecurity practices, Arrington said. Cybersecurity breaches and intellectual property theft of DOD data has led to the theft of high-grade weapon systems, such as the F-35.

“We should be infuriated about what has happened to our data,” she said.

Arrington will be embarking on a listening tour across the country to seek input from contractors for the cybersecurity rules. Arrington is a former South Carolina lawmaker and small business owner who contracted with the government — experiences she said will inform her work to help secure military data.

The greatest counterintelligence risk to the U.S. is not theft of government data, but private sector IP, said Joyce Corell, assistant director for supply chain and cyber at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Governments, like China’s, and their efforts to steal U.S. IP have taken up the majority of the U.S. counterintelligence apparatus’s work, Corell said in a talk following Arrington’s.

New steps to secure the supply chain are critical to plugging the leaks of data. To do so, Corell pushed for cybersecurity to be baked-in across all parts of the supply chain for government contractors. In the past, Corell has pushed small businesses to increase their cybersecurity to work with the government.

Corell and Arrington both drove the message that cybersecurity is needed at all levels of the supply chain, at all levels of contracting and from the military to civilian agencies.

Supply chain security is “a team sport,” Corell said."
USDA Corn Yield Estimate Still Too High,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usda-corn-yield-estimate-still-too-high/,"It’s been a long, arduous planting season for farmers across the U.S. Many farmers are wondering what this will mean for yields, ending stocks and, consequentially, corn prices.

“I think the drop-dead week will be this week for planting,” Michael Cordonnier of Soybean and Corn Advisor, Inc., told AgriTalk Host Chip Flory. “If you plant your corn at this time in June you’ve probably got at least a 20% yield drag. If you go at the end of this week that could go up to 30% or 40%. This is very serious, and we won’t know the yields until later in summer.”

So far, the market isn’t reflecting the tough season.

“USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) showed us down 3 million corn acres with a harvest estimate of 91.7%,” Cordonnier says. “I think a 90% harvest for grain is optimistic—it might be in the 88% to 89% and then lower yield. When you combine all these things, you’re going to get a much lower production number.”

Cordonnier estimates farmers will finish with 86 million corn acres planted, with 90% harvested for grain and a 165 bu./acre yield—putting total production at 12.8 million bu. His yield estimate is just slightly lower than USDA’s 166 bu./acre estimate.

With lower production and unchanged demand, the market could provide positive pricing opportunities.

“The burdensome corn carryout could be gone by the end of the summer,” Cordonnier says. “We’re going to need price rationing to ration the demand.”

South American farmers will be closely watching U.S. corn production, he notes.

“This is a corn story, primarily, in the U.S.,” says Cordonnier. “So, I do think corn acres will go up in South America, especially Argentina. They’re going to take out some soybeans to put in more corn.”"
Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/448383-feds-gone-wild-dojs-stunning-inability-to-prosecute-its-own-bad,"One was caught red-handed engaged in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeMcCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump McCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyUnder Trump, our democracy is for sale Sarah Sanders to leave White House Sarah Sanders to leave White House MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

Environmental Protection Agency releases PolyMet documents,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/2709729-Environmental-Protection-Agency-releases-PolyMet-documents,"Documents released Wednesday show the Environmental Protection Agency was concerned an earlier draft permit for PolyMet’s proposed copper-nickel mine near Hoyt Lakes, set to be the first of its kind in Minnesota, would not meet the standards set in the Clean Water Act unless the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency made substantial changes to the permit.

The MPCA issued that water pollution permit and air permits to PolyMet later in 2018 after reviewing those comments and concerns and sending a revised draft permit back to the EPA in October 2018 . The EPA made no additional comments on the revised permits before the MPCA awarded the final permit to PolyMet in December 2018.

The documents were made public after a lawsuit filed by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on behalf of WaterLegacy, an opponent of the controversial mine, claimed the EPA wrongfully withheld the documents by failing to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request.

WaterLegacy counsel and advocacy director Paula Maccabee told the News Tribune that the documents reveal exactly what the group had believed all along: the EPA had concerns about the draft permits and shared those concerns with the MPCA.

“This is a huge victory for transparency,” Maccabee said.

Maccabee and other opponents of the project allege the concerns were suppressed by the agencies and not made public.

The documents, Maccabee said, “in every other case and under normal practice would just be in the record right away and all you’d have to do is read it.”

The documents show the EPA warned the MPCA that the mine’s draft permits lacked water-quality-based effluent limitations — standards that ensure bodies of water receiving discharged water are not polluted — when returning the draft permits back to the MPCA in 2018.

“The above concerns must be addressed to ensure that the permit will achieve compliance with all applicable requirements of the (Clean Water Act), including water quality requirements of Minnesota and of all affected states,” Kevin Picard, chief of the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System programs branch wrote in a letter to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s Metallic Mining Director. “If unaddressed, the above concerns may result in an EPA objection to a proposed permit.”

Maccabee also said the final permits still don’t have any water quality-based effluent limitations.

In a statement MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton disagreed, calling the permitting process “rigorous” and that appropriate changes were made for the final permits.

“Similar to other complex projects, the MPCA and EPA had frequent conversations during the entire permitting process to discuss technical items,” Broton said. “Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received from the public during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional operating limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel, and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards. That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Citing ongoing litigation, PolyMet spokesperson Bruce Richardson declined to comment on the EPA documents released Wednesday citing, but said the “(National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit issued by the state meets all applicable state and federal standards.”

The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."
Trump's Justice Department should change its tune on antitrust policy,https://thehill.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/448573-trumps-justice-department-should-change-its-tune-on-antitrust-policy,"As a former associate deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, serving under Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrTrump rips Democrats for contempt vote: 'Republicans will remember' Trump rips Democrats for contempt vote: 'Republicans will remember' The Hill's Morning Report - Trump and House Democrats resume battle MORE, I see how the Antitrust Division could positively resolve a developing controversy.

Just one day after The Hollywood Reporter published an article arguing that examining the regulations pertaining to music licensing may be one of the Trump Department of Justice’s (DOJ) top antitrust targets, the Antitrust Division on June 5 re-opened a review into the consent decrees with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI).

From threats of impeachment and investigations embroiling Barr personally, to investigations into apparent intelligence agency misconduct, DOJ certainly has a lot on its plate. And yet, despite all these concerns, the Antitrust Division has re-opened a review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees from 1941, even though DOJ concluded one just three years ago, determining after a two-year review that they should not alter the decrees.

Review processes are rarely reopened this soon after closure. Such occurrences typically mean one thing — the peddling of misinformation from stakeholders who have a hard time taking no for an answer.

Given Barr’s track record cutting through talking points, and knowing the importance of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, I question that this is the work of current AG Barr, especially given everything else competing for his attention. DOJ’s statements on this issue have come from the Antitrust Division head, not the attorney general himself. But Barr has the opportunity to steer the process in the right direction so that performers and consumers of music do not suffer higher costs and fewer opportunities to succeed.

So, what exactly do ASCAP and BMI do, and why do they need to remain restrained?

Almost anyone who has attended law school has read the ASCAP and BMI case law and understands the consent decrees’ significance to the music marketplace. Professors across the political spectrum utilize them as hallmarks of the efficacy of U.S. antitrust law.

Consisting of music publishers, songwriters and composers, the two organizations boast vast membership that has given them control of 90 percent of the music licensing market. Consequently, any bar, club, store or performing arts center that wants to play or perform music on its premises must receive the licensing rights to do so through them.

Although they provide important market efficiencies, ASCAP and BMI use the non-existence of competition and market pressure in the government-created intellectual property industry to their advantage. There is nothing condemnable about this; the job of ASCAP and BMI is to look out for the needs of members, not the industry at large. That is supposed to be the responsibility of DOJ, which must use the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts to ensure competition and innovation in government-created industries.

In 1941, that is what the Justice Department did. It put ASCAP and BMI under consent decrees, which are antitrust orders that, without forcing the institutions in question to admit wrongdoing, stipulate that they keep prices at reasonable rates or else face consequences. The decrees authorize blanket licenses for everything in the repertoires of ASCAP and BMI to any individual or business that requests them.

In 2016, a DOJ review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees found that “the industry has developed in the context of, and in reliance on, these consent decrees and that they therefore should remain in place.” This was the right call, since ASCAP and BMI are just as massive and anti-competitive as they were in the 1940s.

To understand this, one needs only to look at the action DOJ has taken against their predatory behavior in recent years, even with the decrees in place. In one case, ASCAP even agreed to settle for $1.75 million to end further legal action by DOJ. If things are this bad today, intuition should lead anyone to believe that the Trump administration responding to the two monopolies’ calls to relax their antitrust agreements would only make things worse. And yet, that seems to be what the Antitrust Division may be planning to do.

Last year, Congress passed language in the Music Modernization Act (MMA) requiring that it remain apprised on future review processes before the DOJ makes a formal decision. This guidance from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees should go a long way toward ensuring that Barr’s department comes to the right decision.

Making the right call will mean everything to local musicians and the audiences and venues that host and listen to them. Although the royalty system for music overwhelmingly favors the top touring acts, by bringing music licensing pricing closer to market levels, the antitrust decrees protect the playing rights of up-and-coming musicians, who rely more heavily on the use of cover songs. Changing them considerably will cause even more venues to go bankrupt, opt to raise prices or stop supporting music because of the considerable costs. This will harm no one more than the performers and listeners of music themselves.

DOJ’s policy should be to ensure that fair markets exist in areas where the government’s footprint inherently breeds monopolies, such as the copyright industry. Failing to keep the consent decrees as they are will not only run a whole marketplace amuck; it also inevitably will lead to law professors across the country one day utilizing the music industry as a case study in the failures of government, rather than hailing it as a success story.

VA’s new mission: expand services,https://www.wane.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/vas-new-mission-expand-services/,"President Donald Trump signed the MISSION Act into law a year ago. Now, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) is using that law to expand healthcare options for veterans.

The VA says the new law allows VA care providers to recommend veterans go to local hospitals to get the care they need sooner. If a VA care provider determines a veteran cannot be seen in less than 20 days for primary care or less than 28 days for specialty care, that provider can recommend veterans go to a local hospital.

“What the VA MISSION Act does is it allows veterans to have the care they need when they need it and where they need it,” said Heather Tarr, a supervisory health systems specialist for the VA. “It gives veterans greater access to care and greater options in where they go to receive that care.”

Some veterans are excited about their future healthcare with this law.

“I really like it because I’ve literally gotten in a skydiving accident before and instead of going somewhere local, I had to drive an hour and 40 minutes here to Fort Wayne for them to look at me and determine ‘yeah, it’s broken. We need to do this with it,'” said Justin Baker, a veteran who comes to Fort Wayne for healthcare but lives in South Bend. “So, I think it’s awesome.”

Local hospital groups in Fort Wayne told WANE 15 News they are excited about the expanding opportunities to give health care to veterans.

IU Health said in a statement to WANE 15 News, “We want to improve access to care for our veterans, so when we heard about the MISSION ACT, we wanted to be part of the initiative.”

Parkview Hospital has not responded to our request for comment.

Lutheran Health network said in a statement they “look forward to learning more about how the MISSION Act may provide even more access to those who have served our country so bravely.”

The VA is hosting a benefits fair on June 20th at the Parkview Mirro Center. The event runs from 10 in the morning to 7 at night. You can find more information about the benefits you’d be eligible for there and here."
State Department Defends Saudi Arms Sales Before Hostile House Panel,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Catie Edmondson', 'Edward Wong']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html,"WASHINGTON — A senior State Department official on Wednesday defended the Trump administration’s use of an emergency declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, telling a hostile House committee that holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial rivals in China and Russia.

In a contentious hearing, lawmakers from both parties pressed R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Congress’s will.

Lawmakers are outraged by the decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May to use a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to push through more than $8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries are leading an air war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and thousands of civilian deaths, many of them children. In both chambers, bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales, many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year.

Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr. Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24."

US report finds sky is the limit for geothermal energy beneath us,https://arstechnica.com,['Scott K. Johnson'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/report-geothermal-could-power-up-to-16-of-us-grid-by-2050/,"With all attention focused on the plummeting prices and soaring popularity of solar and wind, geothermal energy is probably under-appreciated. Sure, you might think, it’s great where you can get it—in, say, Iceland or the Geysers area of California—but those are exceptions, right? Not entirely. Geothermal power sources come in many forms, and they're typically much more subtle than steam shooting out of the ground. In reality, geothermal energy could be a big player in our future mix.

That is made clear by the US Department of Energy’s recently released “GeoVision” report. The report follows similar evaluations of wind, solar, and hydropower energy and leans on information from national labs and other science agencies. It summarizes what we know about the physical resources in the US and also examines the factors that have been limiting geothermal’s deployment. Overall, the report shows that we could do a whole lot more with geothermal energy—both for generating electricity and for heating and cooling—than we currently do.

Heat and power

There are opportunities to more than double the amount of electricity generated at conventional types of hydrothermal sites, where wells can easily tap into hot water underground. That's economical on the current grid. But the biggest growth potential, according to the report, is in so-called “enhanced geothermal systems.” These involve areas where the temperatures are hot but the bedrock lacks enough fractures and pathways for hot water to circulate freely—or simply lacks the water entirely.

The technology used in natural gas fracking—injecting pressurized fluid underground to form fractures in the rock that released trapped gas into horizontally drilled wells—could be adapted to generate electricity in sites like these. Creating fractures and/or injecting water to get heated by these rocks eventually results in a similar geothermal plant setup, but it takes a lot more engineering than just jamming a straw into a source that's already sending hot water to the surface.

Advancing enhanced geothermal techniques alone could produce 45 gigawatts of electricity by 2050. Add in the more conventional plants, and you’re at 60 gigawatts—26 times more than current geothermal generation. And in a scenario where natural gas prices go up, making geothermal even more competitive, we could double that to 120 gigawatts. That would be fully 16 percent of the total projected 2050 generation in the US.

Additionally, that electricity can be generated around the clock and can even be flexibly ramped up or down, making it an excellent pairing with intermittent forms of renewable energy like wind and solar.

On the heating (and cooling) side, there are two main areas of opportunity. Traditional ground-source heat pumps circulate fluid through loops in the ground to provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and they could be much more widely adopted with minimal effort. The report estimates that installations could increase 14 times over, to 28 million homes by 2050, covering 23 percent of national residential demand. Accounting for limitations in how quickly the market could realistically change brings the number down to 19 million homes—still a massive increase.

There’s even more potential for district heating systems, where a single, large geothermal installation pipes heat to all the buildings in an area. There are only a handful of such systems operating in the US today (Boise, Idaho, has an example), but the report finds more than 17,000 locations where it would make sense, covering heating needs for 45 million homes.

Limited adoption

The report focuses a great deal on the barriers that have so far prevented this eye-popping potential from being realized. Some barriers are indeed technological—those enhanced geothermal systems have yet to reach maturity, for example. Some barriers are simply down to a lack of awareness that things like ground-source heat pumps are already viable options.

But the biggest barriers are financial. Geothermal power plant projects suffer from much higher capital costs (and therefore slower payback times) than other forms of renewable energy. Techniques for placing wells at traditional hydrothermal sites are surprisingly unsuccessful, with many wells failing to produce enough to go into use. With better maps and more advanced site characterization, the misses could be reduced, bringing down costs.

The report also highlights permitting on federal lands as less than smooth. Between awkward overlaps when multiple agencies are involved and backlogs in understaffed departments, it points to approvals that could be consolidated to simplify the process. Streamlining, the report says, could shorten the time it takes to complete a project and reduce the financial risk of starting one. Separately, the constant uncertainty surrounding short-term tax credits for renewable projects also does geothermal no favors.

The 2050 scenarios in the report are based on plausible improvements to these barriers combined with modeling of the economics and operation of the nation’s energy grid. To make the projected numbers a reality, a set of key steps are laid out. Those include the streamlining of permitting, continuing research into the engineering of “enhanced geothermal systems,” improving methods for reducing trial and error at new installations, and outreach to increase awareness of geothermal options.

The other key is maximizing the value of each project. As flexibility is increasingly valued on the grid, compensating geothermal for that value would make it more profitable. There are also a variety of possible industrial uses for heat across the range of ground temperatures—everything from warming greenhouses to aiding cement production. A broader set of applications could help grow the geothermal industry, bringing costs down with scale.

If you’re a geothermal fan and an optimist, the report lays out a tantalizing amount of potential, although it lists plenty of challenges between here and there. In an intro to the report, DOE Geothermal Technologies Office Director Susan Hamm writes, “[T]his report shows us how to move the geothermal dial from what we know exists to what we envision is possible over the next 30 years. The GeoVision analysis takes us beyond a declaration of resource potential by illustrating what is real today and painting a picture of what could be real tomorrow.”"
"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior",https://www.sciencemag.org,['Paul Voosen'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/keep-landsat-data-free-panel-urges-interior-department,"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior

A federal advisory panel today called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to keep access to the imagery from its long-running Landsat satellite program free and open. Any effort to collect fees for such data would generate little money and would actively damage the U.S. remote sensing industry, the panel said in a report.

The Landsat program, which began in 1972 and is managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has produced the world’s longest-running series of satellite images, documenting the vast global changes caused by humanity over the past 47 years. Two Landsat satellites are now in orbit, taking 1200 images a day at a 30-meter resolution. In 2008, USGS stopped charging for use of Landsat images, creating a surge of academic research, along with users in government and industry. The move created about $2 billion in annual economic benefits, according to estimates from earlier this decade. The Landsat annual budget, meanwhile, is about $80 million.

In 2017, DOI asked its National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) to evaluate the possibility of once again imposing charges for using Landsat data, among other approaches to raising revenue. The move, when reported last year, was met with an outcry from scientists in the United States and abroad, along with federal and state agencies and nonprofits running a diverse range from the Wyoming state engineer to the Global Forest Observations Initiative. “The community was very vocal regarding the value of a free and open data policy,” said Frank Avila, a remote-sensing scientist at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Springfield, Virginia, who leads the NGAC subcommittee that authored the report approved today.

The NGAC report echoes those sentiments, according to a presentation by Kevin Pomfret, a lawyer at Williams Mullen in Tysons, Virginia, who led the NGAC study and specializes in remote sensing. An effort to charge for Landsat data would largely drive users to free alternatives offered by the Europeans, while still costing the government a significant sum to run. The net result would be a drain on the U.S. economy, the study said. “Charging a fee for Landsat data will result in negative economic impacts,” Pomfret said at the meeting, and “would not be worth the economic, legal, societal, or political costs.”

The report also explores whether USGS, which runs Landsat, might instead keep the core Landsat data free, while charging for “value-added” imagery or specialized tasks carried out by the satellites. Such a move might raise revenue, the report says, but it could also require substantial regulatory or legal changes. Similarly, money could potentially be saved by hiring a contractor who could more efficiently manage digital access to the Landsat data, but USGS must study this idea more closely.

If DOI is concerned about the cost of the Landsat program, the report concludes, it would be better served by looking at how to reduce the cost of the satellites themselves, rather than attempting to reap revenue from their data. Although the next Landsat satellite, the ninth in the series, is set for a launch in December 2020, USGS and its partners, including NASA, are mulling what the future of the program should look like, especially given the rise of competitors such as the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellites and commercial constellations like Planet. A study on the program’s future architecture is due later this year.

Although the NGAC report was approved unanimously by the panel’s members and will be available online this week, it is ultimately up to DOI to decide whether it will go through with any fees, says Timothy Newman, program coordinator for national land imaging at USGS. But given the report and the nearly universal negative reaction to charging fees, he says, “The reality is that I just don’t see it happening.”"
More mercury in the fish we eat? Don’t let the EPA weaken water-quality rules,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Nate Tyler', 'Amy Grondin', 'Chris Wilke', 'Special To The Times']",06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/more-mercury-in-the-fish-we-eat-dont-let-the-epa-weaken-water-quality-rules/,"Puget Sound, the Columbia River, Lake Washington, the San Juan Islands, the Spokane River, Lake Chelan: Washington state is known for some of the most beautiful and iconic waterways in the country. Significant steps have been taken to recover these waters, each of which has a fish consumption advisory due to toxic pollution. So why would the Environmental Protection Agency move to dramatically weaken limits on three of the most dangerous and persistent chemicals — mercury, arsenic and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — thus preventing us from moving forward with stronger controls that are essential protections for human health?

It’s a question to take to the EPA. In an agency decision dated May 10, the Trump administration revealed its next target in a nationwide assault on environmental regulation: Washington state waters. The agency signaled its intentions to revise or withdraw Washington water-quality standards. If this happens, current hard-won standards designed to protect local seafood consumers will be lost, and the amounts of toxics allowed in Washington’s waters could increase dramatically.

Gov. Jay Inslee, who has acted against Trump’s other environmental rollbacks, was quick to release a statement with Attorney General Bob Ferguson opposing the EPA decision. Ferguson then filed suit June 6 in an attempt to block the Trump administration’s misguided proposal.

While this proposed reversal raises environmental alarms, it will also make seafood we eat and the water we drink less safe. In dismantling an environmental standard known as “Fish Consumption Rule,” the agency would allow for up to 25 times more toxic chemicals like mercury, lead and cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. In the case of arsenic, it would perversely allow increased discharges of this dangerous toxic heavy metal in our waters because it is also “naturally occurring.” This move doesn’t merely raise questions about the administration’s concern for public health. It signals a blatant disregard for it.

Who is most vulnerable? Anyone who consumes locally caught fish. This applies especially to tribal communities, for whom fishing is critical not only for subsistence, but for ceremonial, religious and commercial purposes. Sharing and eating fish is an integral part of tribal culture and social fabric here in the Northwest, and it is well documented that tribal communities consume fish at a higher-than-average rate. Current water-quality standards restrict pollutants that are harmful to fish, and also take into account chemical bioaccumulation to protect the people who eat these foods. Previously, the EPA noted that tribes and Washington residents have a right not only to fish, but also to avoid exposure to unacceptable health risks when consuming local fish and seafood.

Before the current administration’s attempt at rolling back protective water-quality standards, the EPA stated its intent to protect people from cancer and other harmful effects that can arise from consuming polluted fish, shellfish and drinking water. However, most of our local waterways already have fish consumption advisories due to toxic pollution, warning people to limit their intake of certain species.

Toxic pollutants in Puget Sound waters severely impact the survival of our endangered southern resident orca population, as well as their primary prey — chinook salmon. Our southern resident orcas are considered to be among the most PCB-contaminated mammals in the world. Gov. Inslee has been very vocal about protecting orcas and calling for increased protections to reduce toxic contamination. Vigorously opposing EPA’s proposed rollbacks to the fish-consumption rule is an important way he can act to protect these beloved marine mammals that are a keystone species for our entire ecosystem.

This issue is critical to people and communities across the state. The Trump administration is poised to turn its back on Washington citizens and human health in order to line the pockets of corporate interests pushing for the action. We oppose the EPA push to repeal effective water-quality safeguards. We thank Gov. Inslee and state ecology director Maia Bellon for standing up and staying strong defending what is right: clean water for all."

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.
