"Pelosi hits Trump’s deal with Mexico, accuses him of ‘threats and temper tantrums’",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-hits-trumps-deal-with-mexico-accuses-him-of-threats-and-temper-tantrums,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Saturday hit parts of President Trump’s deal with Mexico on stopping migrant flows after he threatened to slap tariffs on the country -- saying that Trump was engaged in “threats and temper tantrums.”

“President Trump undermined America’s preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south,” she said in a statement.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy,” she said

Trump announced Friday that the U.S. and Mexico had reached a deal, after he had previously threatened to slap 5 percent tariffs on all incoming goods from Mexico -- a warning that had sparked concern from both Democrats and Republicans about the trade deal negotiated between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

According to a joint declaration issued by the State Department and Mexico late Friday, Mexico will take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, to include the deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border.”

The U.S. will also expand its “Remain-in Mexico” policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. committed to accelerate asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare and education according to its principles.”

Pelosi said Democrats are “deeply disappointed” by the expansion of “Remain-in Mexico” and said it violates the rights of asylum-seekers, and fails to address the root causes of migration flows from Central America. She also promised that Congress would continue to put pressure on the administration on immigration.

“Congress will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its failures to address the humanitarian situation at our southern border,” she said. “President Trump must stop sabotaging good-faith, constructive, and bipartisan efforts in Congress to address this complex problem in a humane manner that honors and respects our most cherished national values.”

She also called on the administration to “do much more to cooperate in a meaningful way with Mexico in cracking down on smuggling networks.”

“It’s failure to do so thus far is unconscionable and irresponsible,” she said.

Trump on Saturday took a swipe of his own at House Democrats, saying they are getting “nothing done.”

“Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done,” he tweeted. “Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions!”

Mexico Agreed to Take Border Actions Months Before Trump Announced Tariff Deal,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html,"WASHINGTON — The deal to avert tariffs that President Trump announced with great fanfare on Friday night consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the United States over the past several months, according to officials from both countries who are familiar with the negotiations.

Friday’s joint declaration says Mexico agreed to the “deployment of its National Guard throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border.” But the Mexican government had already pledged to do that in March during secret talks in Miami between Kirstjen Nielsen, then the secretary of homeland security, and Olga Sanchez, the Mexican secretary of the interior, the officials said.

The centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s deal was an expansion of a program to allow asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases proceed. But that arrangement was reached in December in a pair of painstakingly negotiated diplomatic notes that the two countries exchanged. Ms. Nielsen announced the Migrant Protection Protocols during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee five days before Christmas.

And over the past week, negotiators failed to persuade Mexico to accept a “safe third country” treaty that would have given the United States the legal ability to reject asylum seekers if they had not sought refuge in Mexico first."

“For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon -- We did that 50 years ago,” Trump tweeted on his return from Ireland.

For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2019

“They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!”

The tweet had stargazers scratching their heads, as the Moon is not a part of Mars, and the tweet contradicted the president’s previous statements about his plans to send humans back to the moon.

In early May, the president said he planned to allocate an additional $1.6 billion for space exploration and tweeted, “Under my Administration, we are restoring @NASA to greatness and we are going back to the Moon, then Mars,” referring to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The tweet was followed by an announcement by NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who said NASA plans to send people to test a flight around the moon by 2022 as the first step in the Artemis program. Named after the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the Moon in Greek mythology, the Artemis program hopes to “return astronauts to the lunar surface by 2024, including the first woman and the next man.”

Plans to have people or a presence on the moon in the long-term were first announced in December 2017 with the president’s Space Policy Directive.

But hours after Trump’s tweet, Bridenstine tweeted from his own verified account, saying “As @POTUS said, @NASA is using the Moon to send humans to Mars! Right now, @MarsCuriosity and @NASAInSight are on Mars and will soon be joined by the Mars 2020 rover and the Mars helicopter.

According to NASA's website, “exploration of the Moon and Mars is intertwined.”

“The Moon provides an opportunity to test new tools, instruments and equipment that could be used on Mars, including human habitats, life support systems, and technologies and practices that could help us build self-sustaining outposts away from Earth,” NASA officials state in its ""Moon to Mars Overview"" section of the agency's website.

“Living on the Gateway for months at a time will also allow researchers to understand how the human body responds in a true deep space environment before committing to the years-long journey to Mars.”

The president’s unexpected Moon tweet appeared to be in reference to a Fox News segment with Neil Cavuto and the NASA's chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit -- as noted by liberal watchdog organization, Media Matters for America.

Trump administration denies embassies’ requests to fly pride flag on flagpoles: reports,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-embassies-pride-flag,"The Trump administration has reportedly rejected requests from U.S. embassies to fly the rainbow pride flag on embassy flagpoles during LGBT Pride month -- an apparent reversal of a practice during the Obama administration.

NBC News first reported that embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia are among those that were denied permission to fly the rainbow flag on embassy flagpoles. The outlet reported that the flag can and is being flown inside embassies and on exterior walls.

TAMMY BRUCE: TRUMP CELEBRATES LGBT PRIDE MONTH AND THE LEFT JUST WANTS TO KEEP STIRRING UP DIVISION

The Obama administration granted blanket approval to fly the flag on outside flagpoles, the outlet reported, but State Department policy is that embassies are expected to ask for permission from Washington.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

The report comes just over a week since President Trump tweeted his own recognition of Pride month and noted that the administration has launched a campaign to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide.

“As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation,” he tweeted.

The German embassy, one of those that reportedly applied for permission, is headed by Ambassador Richard Grenell, the most senior openly gay person in the Trump administration.

""The president's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News.

ABC News reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not approve an official cable normally approved with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

As a result, embassies and consulates could mark both events however they wished, but it still required them to reach out to Washington for approval for the flag to be raised on the flagpole."

As White House aides in Washington spent the week fielding frenzied inquiries about potential tariffs on Mexico, and trying to cut a deal to stop them, other top aides spent the workweek attending swanky dinners abroad, golfing at a Trump-branded course and visiting quaint pubs in Ireland.

Some of those stuck at home were embarrassed by their colleagues’ behavior overseas, conversations with officials inside the White House and in the broader Trump orbit revealed, believing it sent a poor message.

Story Continued Below

Foreign journeys with the president can be exhausting. They’re a whirlwind of logistics and constant activity made harder by jet lag and the physical demands of travel. But judging from the public Instagram accounts of a handful of close aides to President Donald Trump, who accompanied him during his five-day visit through the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, this particular trip looked more like a vacation.

The president’s visit was intended to acknowledge and strengthen the alliances between the countries – and to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day when Allied troops landed on the coastline of France to battle the Nazis.

But much of the trip’s diplomatic and patriotic agenda was overshadowed on social media by glam shots of White House aides appearing to enjoy themselves – not to mention the Trump’s own news-making tweets over the course of the week on tariffs, the border wall and actress Bette Midler.

The post that came across as most egregious to fellow White House aides on Friday came from the account of Hogan Gidley, principal deputy press secretary. Within the span of 48 hours, Gidley posted three scenic shots of the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland. His last one was a video of him in slow motion hitting a golf shot from 14th hole of the course, with a picturesque view of the shoreline on the horizon.

Longtime Trump aide and top HUD official, Lynne Patton, wrote on the Gidley’s post: “Nice form, my friend!” By late Friday evening, Gidley’s golf swing had racked up more than 1,100 views.

Madeleine Westerhout, special assistant to the president and director of Oval Office Operations, posted an Instagram story on Friday of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders being regaled by fans at a local Irish pub, along with the caption “Sarah’s fans at the cutest Irish pub!” She also posted a sunset shot from Trump’s Ireland golf course, creating another branding moment for the Trump properties.

Ivanka Trump was especially prolific on Instagram, posting photos of her and her siblings at a formal dinner hosted by the U.S. Ambassador to the U.K, photos of herself at St. James Palace, and more pics of herself and her husband, White House aide Jared Kushner, at Buckingham Palace — all with multiple outfits.

“The French have a word for the White House officials’ behavior — très gauche,” said Jim Manley, who worked as an aide in the Senate for 21 years including for former Democratic Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid. “I hate to defend Republicans on the Hill, but the code of conduct, if you will, for staffers is still being upheld by both Democrats and Republicans. It is White House and its staffers who are breaking every norm on the book.”

That Washington staffer mantra is that aides, “like children, should be seen and not heard,” said one administration official who expressed disdain over the Instagram posts. This means that staffers should never be the focus of the story, or photo, if they can help it, and instead always should redirect attention toward the elected politicians they serve.

On Capitol Hill, Manley added, if a staffer elevated himself or herself in any way, the chief of staff of the office would tell them to knock it off.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, in contrast, runs the West Wing in a fairly forgiving fashion. Unlike his military-trained predecessor, retired general John Kelly, Mulvaney is not strict about which aides attend meetings or squeeze onto Air Force One, and gives the Trump kids carte blanche.

A White House press aide declined to comment and would not answer questions on the record about whether it had a social media policy for staffers.

But the personal Instagram posts of White House staffers seemed far more prolific than usual compared to previous trips, said one former administration official.

Many of the aides’ Twitter feeds are associated with the White House and will be archived, whereas staffers largely see Instagram as their own personal domain, the former official added — where they are free to post as they wish.

Sanders’ Instagram feed gave off the most controlled vibe. It featured photos of her boss and the first lady meeting veterans or appearing at the D-Day events alongside photos of White House staffers dressed up for the State Dinner at Buckingham Palace, or attending another fancy dinner at the Winfield House.

Both Ivanka Trump and Sanders’ feeds included photos or historical images of the week’s more somber events at Normandy. And the official White House accounts focused on images of Trump appearing presidential, giving his address at the D-Day ceremony, standing before crowds of veterans or appearing with other world leaders or military officials in uniform.

Ethics experts continue to bemoan the way the president and White House staffers often promote Trump businesses — noting in this case that many of the posts amounted to unpaid ads for Trump’s Ireland golf course. And the Doonbeg property now uses photos of the president golfing there in its promotional materials.

""One thing that is really a problem, as I see it, is anything they are putting out there that has them at Trump properties. That is using their official position and the office of the presidency to promote and advance the president’s businesses. That seems like a clear abuse,” says Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of CREW, a non-profit that has sued the president several times over ethics issues.

One professor who studies the interplay between social media and politics thought the top aides’ Instagram posts seemed like an attempt to exert some control over the narrative of the trip as chaotic, a perception fueled by the president’s attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Twitter and in his interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham at the American Cemetery in Normandy.

“Even while Trump has been on the visit, his normal Twitter antics have been going on. We see this attempted corrective to it with the aides’ really staged and nice photos. It is all very positive and laudatory. They frankly seem quite excited to be there,” said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communications at the University of Utah. “I imagine that is an attempt strategically to deflect from him.”

Trump is unlikely to see the staffers’ social media posts, especially on platforms outside of Twitter, said two former administration officials, and if someone called his attention to the luscious landscape shots of his Irish golf course, he would not mind.

“Are you kidding me?” one of the former administration officials added. “Posting about Trump’s golf course? They may get bonuses for doing that.""

According to police, officers conducted a welfare check at the couple's home in Northwest D.C. on Friday. When they arrived they found a man, identified as 51-year-old Jason Rieff, with a handgun who appeared to fire a self-inflicted shot while they were on the scene. Authorities said they also found an unresponsive adult female identified as 45-year-old Lola Gulomova.

The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The People's Climate March in New York City in 2014. Kevin Loria/Business Insider

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

That meeting, which is scheduled for Sunday, would be the first contact between top American and Chinese economic officials since trade talks between the world’s two largest economies abruptly broke down last month.

“If they want to come back to the table and complete the deal on the terms that we were continuing to negotiate, that would be great,” Mr. Mnuchin told reporters at a briefing on Saturday. “If not, as the president said, we’ll move on with tariffs.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""
State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."
A Foreign Service couple’s contentious divorce ends in deadly violence,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Peter Hermann', 'Reporter Covering Crime', 'Specifically The D.C.

Superior Court Friday morning to work out the final details of a fiercely contested divorce.

But Lola Gulomova and Jason Rieff never made it.

Shortly before the 10 a.m. hearing was to begin, Rieff’s lawyer got an urgent message from her client, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an active police investigation. Something was wrong at the couple’s house near American University in Northwest Washington.

The lawyer, Jenny Brody, said she called 911, and police, fearing a mental health emergency, broke down the front door to the redbrick home. They were met by the 51-year-old Rieff holding a handgun, according to a police report. Police said he retreated and shot himself in the head.

In another room, police said, they found 45-year-old Gulomova dead from several gunshot wounds. Police said they believe Rieff killed her before he shot himself. He died at a hospital.

Gulomova’s death was the fifth domestic-related homicide in the District this year, about 7 percent of the total number of killings thus far, a percentage that has held steady over the past few years.

[Domestic killings surge in District in 2014]

Both Gulomova and Rieff were career Foreign Service officers, and they frequently traveled together in joint postings overseas. A friend said the two met at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in the District. The couple married in 2000 and had two daughters, who police said were not home during the shootings.

Their older daughter had been due to be promoted from the fifth grade Friday evening at a ceremony at Janney Elementary School in Tenleytown. The principal postponed the event, noting in a letter to parents that “one of our Janney families has been greatly impacted by a recent tragedy.”

News of Gulomova’s death spread quickly, shocking former colleagues who kept in touch on social media and those at the Commerce Department, where she worked on trade policy in the Office of Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. Rieff worked at the State Department.

“She was very ambitious, and she was always smiling,” said the friend, Katherine Jacobs, who also was in the Foreign Service and met Gulomova and Rieff in Moscow in 2007.

Jacobs and Gulomova were part of a group of women who started families while juggling demanding jobs that sometimes required moving about every two years.

“She was committed to her work,” said Jacobs, who now lives in Leesburg, Va., and runs a consulting company for nonprofit organizations. “She did a beautiful job balancing being a mom and doing an extraordinary service to her country.”

From interviews with two friends and court documents, it appears that the couple’s marital problems began in 2015, after they returned from their last joint overseas assignment. Eventually, Gulomova filed for divorce.

Court records show that Rieff became angry when he learned that Gulomova had accepted a four-year posting to Belgrade, set to start in summer 2020, and that she planned to take their two young daughters.

A judge in March granted Gulomova a default divorce after Rieff repeatedly missed hearings and gave her custody of the children. But the judge had set another hearing for Friday to hear from Rieff’s newly hired lawyer who had contested the decision, saying that her client had not received adequate notice.

A man in Chicago, who identified himself as Rieff’s stepfather, declined to comment. Gulomova’s lawyer did not respond to messages, and Gulomova’s relatives could not be reached.

[Man kills wife, then self inside home in American University Park]

Gulomova was born in Tajikistan, where she once was an expert folk dancer. Friends said her family is scattered all over the world, and a sister lived or had lived in New York City.

A biography provided by the Commerce Department says she worked for the United Methodist Committee on Relief, helping victims of Hurricane Katrina. She later joined NASA and was sent to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to work on space issues and support the International Space Station. She also worked in Taiwan and, in 2010, she helped coordinate a visit by President Barack Obama to India.

Heather Turnbow, 47, of the District met Gulomova 18 years ago at the Silk Road Dance Company, shortly after Gulomova had married Rieff.

“She was brilliant,” said Turnbow, who last saw her friend a week ago when the two met for dinner and drinks and talked over her troubled marriage and her struggle to end it. “She had a really great love for life.”

Turnbow called Gulomova “lively, witty, adventurous, smart and very worldly.” She loved her daughters, Turnbow said, “and she would have been the perfect role model for them.”

"Some U.S. embassies still hoisting rainbow flags, despite advisory from Washington",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'June At Pm']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-embassies-still-hoisting-rainbow-flags-despite-advisory-from-washington/2019/06/08/eeea0bd4-89f4-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html,"A rainbow flag hangs on the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on May 20, 2019. (Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Since the State Department began rejecting all embassy requests to hoist rainbow flags outside the mission buildings during LGBTQ Pride Month this year, some U.S. diplomats have been finding ways to defy, or at least get around, the new policy.

The facades of the U.S. missions in Seoul and Chennai, India, are partially hidden behind large rainbow flags, while the embassy in New Delhi is aglow in rainbow colored lights. The website for the embassy in Santiago, Chile, shows a video of the chief diplomat raising a rainbow flag last month for the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.

The Vienna embassy’s website features a photo of a rainbow flag flying below Old Glory on a mast jutting from the building, a statement by Diplomats for Equality and a story about a professor lecturing on the visibility and growth of LGBT rights.

U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem joined a March for Pride and Tolerance, and several ambassadors have tweeted photos of themselves in local Pride parades or standing outside the embassies surrounded by employees holding up letters spelling PRIDE.

“This is a category one insurrection,” said one diplomat, who like others interviewed about the sentiment over the rejections, which were not made in writing, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired.

A practice routinely approved for most of the decade at many embassies now requires top-level approval from the State Department. But this year, as first reported by NBC News, all requests were nixed.

The flap over the flags started when the State Department did not send out an official cable this year with guidelines for marking Pride Month, as it has in years past. In 2011, the Obama administration directed agencies involved with foreign policy to promote LGBT rights, a striking policy for an agency that, up to the early 1990s, considered homosexuality a security risk and cause for termination.

The Obama administration’s Pride Month guidelines included rules for flying rainbow flags from poles outside embassies — they had to be smaller than the American flag and fly beneath it. But permission was granted with no fuss. By 2016, approvals were left up to each ambassador or chief of mission.

That process changed last year, after Mike Pompeo became secretary of state. An evangelical Christian who believes marriage should be defined as between a man and woman, Pompeo has said gay employees will be respected and treated like everyone else. But he has downplayed some symbols of LGBT rights, while introducing several new panels and envoys specializing in religious freedom issues.

The advisory cable that came out last year said diplomats are required to obtain top-level approval from the State Department’s Office of Management to fly a rainbow flag.

The State Department declined to answer questions about the Pride Month advisory and rainbow flag ban. But two diplomats familiar with the events said all requests last year were approved.

This year, there was a shift. Embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia, plus a handful of other posts, asked to fly rainbow flags. All were denied, said a person at the State Department who was familiar with what happened.

Although most embassies seem to be toeing the line, the policy shift appears to have sparked something of a revolt among diplomats.

Foreign Service officers have complained on a private Facebook page that nobody should have asked for permission anyway.

Some embassies that have flown the flag in previous years opted this year to commemorate the month by posting on their websites President Trump’s statement affirming LGBT rights and inviting nations to join a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality. The initiative was the idea of Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, who is gay.

Some embassies got playful with the display of Trump’s statement. In Brasilia, for example, the statement is topped by a photo of two hands holding five Play-Doh letters in rainbow colors: LGBTQ. But some did not mention Trump’s statement at all, an absence made more glaring by the juxtaposition with statements by ambassadors and secretaries of states left over from previous years.

Some gay employees in the foreign and civil service say the ban on flying the rainbow flag is just the tip of an iceberg of slights.

Pompeo has not issued a statement for Pride Month, as he did last year. He did not attend the State Department’s annual Pride Day event for two years running as his predecessors usually did, though he was traveling in Europe this year. Instead, he dispatched Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan, a veteran diplomat who promised that the State Department will advocate for gay diplomats and their families.

“Day by day, a death by a thousand cuts, our rights as lgbt+ Americans are being eroded with the removal of a guidance here, the rewriting of a policy there, or just the quiet disappearance of a web site,” Robyn McCutcheon, a transgender woman who has served in several posts abroad, wrote in her blog “Transgender at State,” lamenting what she has observed throughout the government in the past two years. “It should come as no surprise that this erosion would happen also at the U.S. Department of State.”

Some acknowledge that their worst fears have not been borne out.

The administration has appointed several gay ambassadors. Trump became the first Republican president to make a statement celebrating Pride Month. No one has been fired for sexual orientation, but some said they have felt more vulnerable after Trump tried to ban transgender people from the military.

Better, they said, to not even discuss LGBT issues publicly and risk the consequences of drawing attention to themselves.

“We fly below the radar,” one employee said. “We survive because they don’t realize we’re here.”"
"US Attorney Durham 'very dialed in' as he launches Russia probe review, met with Barr 'multiple times': sources",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-russia-barr-sources,"The Connecticut U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia probe is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions,” according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN

Fox News has learned that Durham has been getting briefed on the “four corners” of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues. Barr appointed Durham, 68, last month.

News of Durham's high level of engagement in the probe comes days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation.

""In fact probably have more questions, and some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened,"" Barr told CBS News in an interview.

Durham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News is told Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.

During the CBS interview, Barr revealed Durham picked up the FISA and surveillance components from Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber, whose work was put on hold pending DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's findings from his ongoing review. Huber, Barr said, “was essentially on standby” in case Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.”

Horowitz's investigation is expected to be completed shortly.

Before the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to “tee up” potential targets for future investigation.

They pointed in particular to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.

Simpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr’s records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.

Last month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr’s wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows' referral stated.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony."""
"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."
Treasury targets Iran's most profitable oil refiners with new sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/treasury-targets-irans-most-profitable-oil-refiners-with-new-sanctions,"The Treasury Department imposed broad sanctions Friday on Iran's petrochemical and refinery industry for contributing funds to the financial arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department recently named a terrorist organization.

The sanctions target Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding group, called the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company, which maintains dozens of companies and subsidiaries.

“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines"" to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed the sanctions on the holding company's 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based marketing firms.

The Treasury charges the petrochemical refiners with providing financial support to Khatam al-Anbiya, the Revolutionary Guard's engineering conglomerate, which the U.S. government refers to as the ""economic arm"" of the group.

“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.

The Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and its group of subsidiaries represent 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production and 50% of Iran’s total petrochemical exports, according to the Treasury Department."
U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."
Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

DOJ files detail Flynn-Russia contacts shortly before FBI informant sprang into action,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-files-flynn-russia-fbi-informant,"A Justice Department court filing Thursday provided more details on Michael Flynn's contacts with high-level Russian officials in December 2015 and January 2016, a period shortly before a U.S. intelligence informant allegedly sprang into action to seek out more information on the future national security adviser.

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, a Russian-born U.K. academic said FBI source Stefan Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn.

MUELLER FILES SHOW FLYNN UNDER INVESTIGATION EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT

Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance at the time of the contacts.

The information was contained in a so-called ""302"" witness report prepared by top FBI brass and finalized more than three weeks after Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 White House interview with two FBI agents, including Peter Strzok. Flynn previously served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration, before advising the Trump campaign and briefly joining that administration. A semi-redacted version of the 302 was released last December that omitted reference to some of Flynn's contacts after his DIA service.

In particular, only the unredacted 302 indicates that Flynn told the interviewing agents that he had ""met with Kislyak at the Russian Ambassador's residence next to the University Club prior"" to traveling to Russia in December 2015. The mid-afternoon visit, which the 302 characterized as a ""courtesy call,"" came as Flynn was preparing to travel to Moscow as a private citizen to speak at a Russia Today (RT) event.

Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak on Middle East issues at the gathering, where he shared a table with President Vladimir Putin. According to the 302, Flynn received an appropriate ""threat briefing"" from U.S. officials before attending.

Additionally, according to both the redacted and unredacted 302s, ""Flynn stated he called Ambassador Kislyak following [former GRU Director Igor] Sergun's death in Lebanon ... to express his condolences"" and note that Sergun was ""someone the U.S. could work with."" Segun died Jan. 3, 2016.

Just days later, as Flynn's role informally advising the Trump campaign became known, a Russian-born U.K. academic, Svetlana Lokhova, said she received an invitation out of the blue to a private dinner party with Halper.

Halper is widely reported to have been a confidential source in the FBI's original probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis.

“It was very, very unusual because Stefan Halper and I, despite being part of the same group, and meeting pretty much in a public forum, we've had no personal contact at all. [Halper] to me was an obnoxious academic who absolutely hated all Russians,"" Lokhova told Fox News in April.

FLYNN: FBI PUSHED ME NOT TO HAVE LAWYER AT FATEFUL WHITE HOUSE INTERVIEW

In a lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing, as new information suggests the Trump team was targeted earlier than previously known. Buried in the second volume of the Mueller report was a mention of an existing FBI investigation of Flynn ""based on his relationship with the Russian government,"" which predated Flynn's phone calls during the presidential transition in December 2016 with Kislyak that ultimately led to his termination for lying.

It had been originally thought that Flynn’s communications with Kislyak – picked up by the U.S. intelligence community – made the FBI suspicious, sparking the Flynn probe.

According to Mueller's report, ""members of the intelligence community were surprised by Russia's decision not to retaliate in response to the sanctions. When analyzing Russia's response, they became aware of Flynn's discussion of sanctions with Kislyak. Previously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn based on his relationship with the Russian government. Flynn's contacts with Kislyak became a key component of that investigation.""

After Fox News reported on the development last month, President Trump questioned, in a tweet, why he wasn't briefed on the probe in 2016 ""so that I could make a change?""

Separately, the 302 released Thursday also revealed for the first time that in late December 2016, Kislyak called Flynn to set up a videoconference between the president-elect and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The call was to take place Jan. 21, 2017 -- the day after Trump's inauguration."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

(Credit: DHS OIG)

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

(Credit: DHS OIG)

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

"At Trump’s Agriculture Department, science is being plowed under",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gale A. Buchanan', 'Catherine E. Woteki', 'June At Pm']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/07/trumps-agriculture-department-science-is-being-plowed-under/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)

Gale A. Buchanan and Catherine E. Woteki are former chief scientists of the Agriculture Department, where they served (2006-2009 and 2010-2017, respectively) as undersecretary for research, education and economics.

For the second year in a row, Trump administration leadership at the Agriculture Department proposed budget cuts and took other steps that hamper agencies within the department that supply the data and science needed to inform farm and food policy.

Whether the actions at the USDA reflect malice or ignorance, the results are the same: Policymakers in Congress and America’s farmers will lack the sound science they need to make decisions about how best to feed the nation, improve the rural economy and bolster U.S. agricultural exports.

As the USDA’s chief scientists from the previous two administrations, we are deeply concerned about the harm being done to scientific integrity at the department. We won’t speculate on the motives of the Trump administration’s leaders at the USDA, but we can say that these proposals came only after objective studies and analyses produced by economists and scientists at the USDA’s Economic Research Service, or ERS, conflicted with Trump administration policies.

For example, analysis by ERS economists on the effects of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act stated, “Farm households with income between the 20th to 80th percentile see a modest reduction in their effective income tax rates, while wealthier households, the top 10 percent and top 1 percent, see the biggest decreases in their rates.”

The attempt to defund the ERS also offers some clues about what type of research the Trump administration seems to dislike. The budget suggested cuts to research into food assistance and nutrition, food safety, and analysis of farm, conservation and trade policy.

Numbers don’t lie, but you can attempt to hide them from Congress and the public, undermine them just enough to cast doubt or make them disappear altogether.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appears to be taking a multipronged approach toward dismantling the science that for years has undergirded policy decisions.

First, Perdue tried the direct approach: simply cutting the ERS budget. That approach failed last year when Congress restored the funds. The administration is trying again with its 2020 budget, proposing to cut $42 million — about 50 percent — from the ERS programs and reduce the number of full-time employees to 160 from 331.

Next, the Perdue-led USDA pushed a policy that required all published research from the department to be labeled “preliminary.” When scientists and economists publish in scientific journals, it is only after rigorous peer review. The “preliminary” label appears designed to undermine the research and strike a blow against evidence-based policymaking.

Finally, late last summer, Perdue shocked many researchers in food and agriculture with his decision to move the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of the Washington area. The USDA sidestepped the usual processes for relocation, such as conducting a search through the government’s General Services Administration, and selected potential homes in North Carolina, Indiana and Kansas City, Mo..

Employees learned earlier this year that after the USDA chooses the relocation site, they would have 120 days to move or quit. Many of the economists that would be affected instead found new jobs at other agencies in the District — creating the sort of brain drain that the administration has seemed intent on prompting with its proposed budget cuts.

Perdue also proposed moving oversight of the ERS to the chief economist in his office. We strongly oppose this move because it makes the unit vulnerable to political pressure.

The agency now reports to the chief scientist — a post that remains unfilled after President Trump’s nominee, Sam Clovis, a conservative radio talk show host and former Iowa campaign aide with no background in science, withdrew from consideration in November 2017. Congress should demand that the Trump administration nominate, as soon as possible, a new, independent chief scientist who can obtain swift and broad, bipartisan support.

Food and agriculture in the United States face perennial challenges from a multitude of sources: pests, diseases, droughts, flooding, brutally competitive markets and trade disputes. It is disheartening to think that the science underpinning these vital contributors to the U.S. economy, and to the health and well-being of every American, is under threat from the very government department overseeing them.

Hart Van Denburg/CPR News

The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General made unannounced visits to four immigrant detention facilities in 2018, including the ICE Processing Center in Aurora.

In its review of the visits, the IG described risks and violations found at all four sites. In Aurora, those included issues with unlabeled food and improper segregation of detainees. Also, the Aurora center doesn’t provide any outdoor space for recreation or allow in-person visitations.

Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette says that the report shows that detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Aurora facility are not being properly cared for.

Aurora Rep. Jason Crow, also a Democrat, has made oversight of the detention facility a focus since he took office in January. He called the Inspector General’s report “deeply disturbing.”

Crow was turned away when he attempted to conduct an unannounced tour of the facility in February. He is now sponsoring a bill that would require ICE detention centers open their doors to members of Congress within 48 hours of a request.

“When we tried to visit the ICE detention center in Aurora unannounced, it was because we were afraid that ICE would put on the window dressing for Congress and, as we see today, it turns out those fears were not unfounded. It’s time we held ICE accountable,” Crow said.

ICE took immediate steps to correct some of the issues, and say they are working to resolve all the problems highlighted in the report.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Alethea Smock noted the OIG report found that the Aurora facility far exceeds all recreation requirements of the Performance-Based National Detention Standards 2011.

As for allowing detainees to have in-person visits, Smock said the Aurora center does not have the facility for it. She said, “It is up to the deportation officer to accommodate as best as they can.”

However, the report includes a picture of a room full of tables and chairs at the center and notes “private visitation meeting rooms and [an] open area room for contact visits exist, though the facility does not use them.” Investigators said management told them they didn’t allow detainees to have contact with visitors out of concern for security and contraband. Detainees interviewed for the report “emphasized that contact visits, especially to see their children and other family members, should be allowed.”

The privately run GEO detention center opened a 432-bed annex earlier this year, primarily to hold people picked up at the Mexican border. It has struggled with medical concerns in recent months, with hundreds of detainees quarantined to prevent the spread of mumps and chickenpox."

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source,https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/447394-key-figure-that-mueller-report-linked-to-russia-was-a-state-department,"In a key finding of the Mueller report, Ukrainian businessman Konstantin KilimnikKonstantin KilimnikKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ex-GOP lawmaker says Trump 'illegitimate president,' should be impeached MORE, who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ocasio-Cortez says Manafort, others should be released from solitary confinement MORE, is tied to Russian intelligence.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENT

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

And former Trump attorney John Dowd made a compelling case that Mueller’s report wrongly portrayed a phone message he left for a witness.

A few more such errors and omissions, and Americans may begin to wonder if the Mueller report is worth the paper on which it was printed.

"Trump Tweets About Moon, Mars, the Internet Scratches Its Head",http://www.newser.com,['Jenn Gidman'],06-08-2019,2019,6,http://www.newser.com/story/276252/trump-tweets-about-moon-the-internet-scratches-its-head.html,"(Newser) – If you were wondering why everyone was making moon and Mars jokes online yesterday and into today, it can all be traced back to a tweet. President Trump was behind the online posting that had everyone buzzing, putting up somewhat of a puzzler Friday afternoon regarding upcoming space missions by NASA. ""For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago,"" he tweeted. ""They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!"" In addition to people wondering if the president really thinks the moon is a part of Mars, some tried to figure out how this new message jibed with recent ones in which the president seemed gung-ho about future expeditions to the moon.

Amid all the jokes, moon fact-checks (Mars actually isn't a part of the lunar landscape, if you didn't know by now), and double takes—BuzzFeed rounds up a bunch of them—Business Insider put in a good-faith effort to decipher what Trump meant and/or why he put up that post. It cites Media Matters' Matt Gertz, who worked ""backwards"" to trace the president's thinking. Gertz's conclusion? That a Neil Cavuto segment on NASA that aired on Fox News about an hour or so before Trump's tweet may have triggered it. Cavuto's take was that NASA is ""refocusing on the moon, the next sort of quest, if you will, but didn't we do this moon thing quite a few decades ago?"" Vox agrees with the Cavuto theory, and adds some more to the backstory here. (Read more President Trump stories.)

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

[Read the inspector general’s internal review of the oversight missteps here]

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."
Elijah Cummings indicates he will move ahead with contempt vote against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/doj-2020-census-response-house-oversight/index.html,"(CNN) The chairman of the House Oversight Committee indicated Friday morning that he will proceed with a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over a dispute about documents regarding a potential citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday it was working to get the committee more documents in response to a subpoena for the information, but said some materials the panel has requested will continue to be withheld. Justice is also refusing to allow John Gore, a senior official in the civil rights division, to appear before the committee without department counsel in the room -- which the committee has thus far refused to allow.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said that offer was insufficient.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement Friday morning. ""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration's cover-up.""

Cummings had said Monday he would postpone the contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: I think she’s a disgrace. I actually don’t think she’s a talented person, I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them.



They thought their good friend Bobby Mueller was going to give them a great report and he came out with a report with 13 horrible, angry Democrats who are totally biased against me. A couple of them worked for Hillary Clinton, they then added five more, also Democrats, with all of that two and a half years think of it, from before I even got elected they’ve been going after me and they have nothing.



INGRAHAM: Do you mind if he testifies still, before you said you didn’t care if Mueller testified.



TRUMP: Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself the last time she – because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong but Nancy Pelosi, I call her Nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn’t talk about it. Nancy Pelosi’s a disaster, OK, she’s a disaster and let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they’re in big trouble because when you look at the kind of crimes that were committed and I don’t need any more evidence and I guess from what I’m hearing there’s a lot of evidence coming in. But you look, and then ask Nancy, why is her district a drug needles all over the place. It’s the most disgusting thing what she’s allowed to happen to her district. With needles, with drug addicts, with people living in the middle streets, with people living on the sidewalk, you can’t go – she ought to focus on that because she’s a disaster and she made a statement, it was a horrible, nasty…



INGRAHAM: When you were overseas…



TRUMP: …vicious statement while I’m overseas, now if I made any statement about anybody it would be like a big head, why would he do that when he’s overseas. She didn’t want to – she is a terrible person and I’ll tell you her name, it’s Nervous Nancy because she’s a nervous wreck."
Tester says Mission Act ‘biggest change in a generation’ of VA health care,https://krtv.com,['Mike Dennison'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://krtv.com/news/montana-politics/2019/06/06/tester-says-mission-act-biggest-change-in-a-generation-of-va-health-care/,"FORT HARRISON — On the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Europe, U.S. Sen. Jon Tester spent the morning in Fort Harrison Thursday at Montana’s main Veterans Administration Medical Center, meeting with national VA leaders to discuss implementation of a sweeping new health law for military veterans.

“It’s the biggest change in VA health care in a generation,” he said of the VA Mission Act, which was passed by Congress a year ago and took effect Thursday. “If it’s implemented correctly … I think this could be a real win for the veterans in the country and give them the ability to get more timely health care, better-quality health care and build the capacity within the VA, too.”

The law’s most significant change is making it easier for veterans to see private physicians and other health-care providers, if they have a long wait for care within the VA system.

If a veteran’s wait for an in-house VA appointment is longer than 20 days, they can see an outside provider.

The law takes seven separate “community care” programs allowing vets covered by the system to see private doctors and consolidates them into one new program.

Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and a co-sponsor of the bill, met Thursday at Fort Harrison with Richard Stone, the head of the VA Health Administration, and James Gfrerer, the chief technology officer for the system.

Implementation of the new program will be critical, Tester said — but that he believes the VA has done a good job educating veterans on how the new system should work.

“I think the veterans are looking forward to it, but they want something that will work,” he told reporters at a news conference at the entry gate to Fort Harrison. “They were sick of the Choice Act; it was a train wreck from the get-go. That’s why we gave the VA a year to implement this.”

The 2014 Choice Act is widely regarded as a failure, falling short of cutting down on wait times for veterans seeking care in the system.

About 47,000 Montana veterans use the VA Health System for their care and as many as 30,000 more veterans may be eligible, Tester’s office said.

Tester said keeping veterans informed and responding to complaints will be important as the new system is rolled out.

“The real important day isn’t today; it’s a year from now, when we can have this same press conference and I can tell you without reservations that it’s lived up to expectations,” he said.

The VA Mission Act also seeks to beef up the VA Health System itself, by helping recruit and retain medical personnel, and other steps."
DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

"More Than 100,000 Americans Urge EPA To Restrict Unnecessary Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller on Oats",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/more-100000-americans-urge-epa-restrict-unnecessary-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-oats,"WASHINGTON – This week, more than 100,000 Americans officially joined EWG and 20 companies calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly restrict the use of Monsanto’s weedkiller glyphosate on oats as a pre-harvest drying agent.

A coalition of companies and public interest groups, led by EWG and Megafood, gathered 104,952 signatures on online petitions to the EPA, urging the agency to lower the tolerance limit of glyphosate in oats and prohibit its pre-harvest use. The names of those who signed the petitions were submitted to EPA on Wednesday.

The EPA’s legal limit for glyphosate residues on oats is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, first filed last September, asks the agency to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

“Administrator Andrew Wheeler and the EPA could quickly remove one of the more concerning routes of dietary exposure to glyphosate for children by restricting the unnecessary use of glyphosate on oats,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil. “Americans are demanding the agency act to protect the public and the food supply from being contaminated with this toxic weedkiller linked to cancer.”

“It’s hard to find 100,000 people who agree on anything,” O’Neil said. “But when it comes to feeding themselves and their families, they agree that we should not have to worry whether eating healthy, oat-based foods for breakfast could come with a dose of glyphosate.”

The petition was amended this week and submitted to the EPA docket to include additional companies that have signed on since last year.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most widely used pesticide in the world. It is largely used as a weedkiller on genetically modified corn and soybeans. But it is increasingly being used for crop management and applied pre-harvest to a number of non-genetically engineered crops, including oats.

Glyphosate kills the crop, drying it out so it can be harvested sooner than if the plant were allowed to die naturally. This is very likely one of the leading sources of dietary exposure for people who consume foods made with oat-based foods, like cereal and oatmeal.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG scientists consider protective for children’s health with an adequate margin of safety.

On June 12, EWG will release results of its latest tests, which will include additional oat-based cereals and other foods that were not analyzed for glyphosate in the two earlier rounds.

A 2017 study by a team of California scientists estimate that between 2014 and 2016, at least 70 percent of American adults surveyed had detectable levels of the cancer-causing weedkiller in their bodies. That compares to 12 percent in American adults between 1993 and 1996, just before the use of glyphosate started to surge with the advent of GMO crops designed to withstand direct application of the chemical.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

These companies are cosigners of the petition to the EPA: MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farm, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions, PCC Community Markets, Foodstirs and Kamut International, Ltd.

Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."
"Bill Barr ""strayed from the ideals of the DOJ and everything it should stand for,"" Mimi Rocah says",https://www.salon.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/07/bill-barr-strayed-from-the-ideals-of-the-doj-and-everything-it-should-stand-for-mimi-rocah-says_partner/,"On Thursday, former federal prosecutor and NBC legal analyst Mimi Rocah wrote an editorial scorching Attorney General William Barr for spinning former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, and then criticizing Mueller himself, in order to protect President Donald Trump.

“Over and over again, Barr seemed to bank on the fact that few people would actually read the full Mueller report and so Trump’s and Barr’s false narrative of ‘no collusion, no obstruction’ would be accepted in the media and by the public,” wrote Rocah. Now that the report is out and Mueller himself has contradicted this, “Barr has done what many good defense attorneys do — attack the investigation and the investigator,” insinuating there was misconduct in the investigation and going after Mueller’s prosecutorial judgment for not explicitly determining whether the president committed a crime.

“If Barr really thought that it was Mueller’s obligation to announce a conclusion about whether he thought Trump had committed a prosecutable crime, he could have directed Mueller (who worked for him) to render one,” said Rocah. “But Barr didn’t do that. And what about the other investigations into Trump? Shouldn’t any other United States attorney’s office with evidence of Trump’s participation in a crime announce their conclusions? The Southern District of New York has already implicated Trump in a campaign finance fraud scheme. This is surely not the outcome Barr intends, but it is the logical outgrowth of his critique of Mueller.”

In contrast to Mueller, who made clear the precedent he was following in his investigation and analysis, Barr is muddying the waters on the basic issues.

“If Mueller had indeed made a mistake in his legal analysis, it would be within Barr’s power to correct that. But nothing about what Barr has said suggests any error by Mueller,” said Rocah. “In his April 18 press conference, Barr claimed that because Trump was ‘frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,’ these were ‘non-corrupt motives’ that weighed ‘heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.’ That logic is laughable. Most people charged with obstruction of justice (or any crime) are frustrated and angry. That doesn’t negate the seemingly illegitimate and corrupt motives Trump had when attempting to impede the Mueller investigation and other federal investigations. There is just no question that the ‘angry and frustrated’ defense would not be recognized in federal court by a judge or a jury.

Similarly, Rocah added, Barr’s claim that obstruction requires an underlying crime to be proven is not true. “There are dozens of examples of cases brought by the DOJ under different administrations of people prosecuted for obstruction and perjury where no underlying crime was proven,” she wrote. “Plus, if this was true, only the least successful obstructors would ever be prosecuted.”"

Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

OPERATION TARGETING MS-13 GANG IN TEXAS NETS NEARLY 2 DOZEN ARRESTS, OFFICIALS SAY

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.
