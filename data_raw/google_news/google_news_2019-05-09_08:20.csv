Trump announces $448M in hurricane recovery funds at raucous Florida rally,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rally-panama-city-beach-florida,"President Trump announced Wednesday night his administration would allocate $448 million in federal aid to communities in Florida affected by last year's Category 5 Hurricane Michael, all while blasting Democrats standing in the way of his policies, at a raucous ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Panama City Beach.

""In the wake of the terrible storm, this extraordinary community pulled together and showed the world your unbreakable spirit,"" Trump told supporters. ""Today, I'm doing the most allowed by law to support the people of Florida. Because of the severity of the storm -- Category 5 -- we will have the federal government pay for 90 percent of the cost in many circumstances.""

The White House has blamed ""Democrat obstruction"" for a stoppage in recovery work, with about 120 projects being deferred. The president's opposition to more hurricane aid for Puerto Rico has sparked a standoff with congressional Democrats that has blocked some assistance to the island and elsewhere, including the Florida Panhandle.

""The money is coming immediately,"" the president added. ""No games, no gimmicks, no delays, we're just doing it.""

RED SOX MANAGER CORA WON'T VISIT WHITE HOUSE, CITING HURRICANE MARIA RECOVERY

The president repeated his claim that Puerto Rico had received $91 billion to help it recover from 2017's Hurricane Maria, which he called ""the most money we've ever given to anybody. We've never given $91 billion to a state. We gave Puerto Rico $91 billion ... and they don't like me.""

Producing a bar graph printout from his suit coat pocket, Trump showed the amount of aid given to Puerto Rico compared to other disaster-hit states. ""I didn't want to spend on a big board because that costs the government too much money,"" he joked before complaining that leaders on the island territory ""want more money. They got $91 billion, the largest amount of money ever given for a hurricane to a state ... and that's the way it is.""

""I think that the people of Puerto Rico are very grateful to Donald Trump for what we've done for them,"" the president said. ""That was a bad storm."" The White House has said the $91 billion figure includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements that could span decades, along with $41 billion already approved. Actual aid to Puerto Rico has amounted to about $11 billion so far.

DONALD TRUMP JR. SUBPOENAED BY SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

In response to the president's remarks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement accusing Senate Republicans of being ""more committed to hurting our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico than healing communities everywhere.

""Meanwhile, the President has doubled down on Republicans’ callousness, deliberately delaying assistance payments to Puerto Rico and inflicting more needless suffering on the Americans who are still reeling from his Administration’s disastrous response to the hurricanes,"" Pelosi added. ""And so, hard-hit communities from the Florida panhandle to the Midwest are stuck waiting for the GOP-controlled Senate to pass a bill to help them. We are now just weeks away from another hurricane season and Republicans continue to delay and play politics. When disaster strikes, all Americans deserve to know that their government is there for them.""

The rally, the fourth held by the Trump campaign this year, began hours after the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress.

That vote came after the president invoked executive privilege in order to prevent lawmakers from seeing the full unredacted report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian activities during the 2016 election.

Trump slammed Democrats in his speech for wasting time and resources on the Russia investigation, which he said led to nothing.

HOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA FULL MUELLER REPORT FOLLOWING VOTE TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT

“Instead of wasting time, energy, taxpayer dollars on partisan stunts, hoaxes and witch hunts, Democrats should be focused on building up our country,"" the president said. ""No collusion, no obstruction, no anything ... Two years on a witch hunt, almost $40 million, 20 Trump haters … after two years, nothing!”

Mueller’s report concluded that the two-year-long investigation into the Trump campaign found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s associates and the Russian government. The report did not, however, come to a conclusion on the separate question of whether Trump obstructed justice as president. House Democrats have subpoenaed the full unredacted report, as well as the underlying evidence Mueller used to come to his conclusions, but the Department of Justice has denied those requests.

“It is a disgrace. We have to focus on infrastructure, we have to focus on lowering medical prices and medicine, always focus on our military and our vets, which we’ve done,” the president said. “It's time to stop this nonsense.”

SESSIONS SIDES WITH BARR OVER FBI 'SPYING' ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN

Trump has said the Democrats' attempts to see the full report were merely an effort to damage him politically ahead of next year's election. The administration also has rejected efforts by Democrat-led House committees to investigate Trump's business dealings or tax returns as well as the West Wing's security clearance procedure.

The president took several shots at rival Democrats in the 2020 White House race Wednesday night, calling them ""some real beauties"" and mock-pleading: ""Let's just pick somebody, please, and let's start this thing."" He joked that he would like to see South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg negotiating trade deals with China, saying, ""That will be great.""

""We have a choice between Sleepy Joe [Biden] and Crazy Bernie [Sanders], and I'll take any of them,"" said Trump at another point in the rally, before adding: ""Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, witch hunts and delusions. The Republican Party is the party for all Americans. We want to make America great again, that's what we're doing.""

Trump also highlighted the American economy, calling it “the envy of the world.”

“Our growth number came in for the first quarter, which is almost always the lowest quarter of the year historically, 3.2 percent, crushing expectations,” he said.

The president added that since the election, his administration has created nearly 6 million new jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 700,000 construction jobs. Trump said had he promised those numbers during the 2016 campaign, the mainstream media would say he exaggerated them.

Trump also noted the unemployment rate has reached its lowest point in 49 years and told supporters not to worry about this week's talks between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators, including his threat to increase tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports at the end of the week. ""They [China] broke the deal"" in talks meant to de-escalate a year-long trade war, he said.

""We won't back down until China stops,"" Trump said. ""The era of economic surrender is over.""

Prior to the rally at the Aaron Bessant Park Amphitheater, Trump visited Tyndall Air Force Base, which took a serious hit from Hurricane Michael. The White House said almost all 700 structures on the base were damaged, roughly one-third were destroyed and 11,000 base personnel evacuated.

Almost every building appeared damaged in some way, including a collapsed hangar.

After touring the base, Trump promised officials, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, that it will be rebuilt ""better than ever.""

Donald Trump Jr. Is Subpoenaed to Testify to Senate Panel on Russia Contacts,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Mark Mazzetti', 'Maggie Haberman']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-subpoena.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, who met with Russians in June 2016 after being promised political dirt about Hillary Clinton, according to people familiar with the committee’s decision.

The younger Mr. Trump is the first of President Trump’s children to be subpoenaed in the continuing congressional investigations into Russia’s 2016 election interference, and the move by the Republican-led committee is a sign that some members of the president’s party are not aligned with his desire for a swift end to all of the Russia inquiries.

News of the subpoena came a day after Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, sought to lower the curtain on the drama in Congress surrounding Russia’s efforts to sabotage the 2016 election. The end of the Mueller investigation, he said, meant “case closed.”

But the subpoena of the younger Mr. Trump shows that the Intelligence Committee, which is under Mr. McConnell’s jurisdiction, is proceeding with its vigorous investigation that — for the most part — has not degenerated into a partisan morass like a parallel investigation by the House."

“We have that young man, Buttigieg, boot-edge-edge, they say boot-edge-edge,” Trump said, repeating the pronunciation chant that supporters of the 37-year-old mayor use at rallies. “He’s got a great chance, doesn’t he? He’ll be great representing us against President Xi of China.”

“I want to be in that room, I want to watch that one,” the president said at the event in Panama City Beach.

Prior to bringing up Buttigieg — who the president has mildly gone after in the past — Trump hit the Democrats’ two front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

“In fact one of the Democrats today said that he — it’s a he, sleepy person,” Trump said as an aside. “Said that he heard from a lot of foreign leaders that they want him to be president.”

“Of course they do, so they can continue to rip off the United States,” Trump continued. “If I heard that, I’d never vote for him,” the president added.

Trump went on to knock “crazy Bernie” saying that Democrats had some “real beauties.”

He also mocked former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s plunge in the polls.

“Boy has he fallen like a rock. What happened to Beto?” Trump mused.

The four candidates of the 22 running that the president went after are all white men.

The president, speaking to a crowd in Panama City Beach, Florida, told them several times through his nearly hour-and-a-half campaign speech that he was ready for the general election to begin.

“Pick somebody please and let’s start this thing! Pick somebody,” he said.

Democrats won’t start voting for candidates until next February."

Thanks to Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig, we’ve learned that Trump’s old tax records show that during his “Art of the Deal” era, he was pretty much the national champion for financial underachievers. In 1990 and 1991 he had losses of over $250 million a year — “more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years.”

Well, you can’t deny he was a record-breaker.

Trump likes to portray his old financial troubles as a temporary product of a recession. But even back then it was pretty apparent that he wasn’t really, truly all that great at deal-making. At the time, I called him a “financially embattled thousandaire” and he took great offense.

Try that yourselves, people. See how often you can refer to our president as “our world-famous thousandaire.” He seems to have more money now, but it’ll still drive him crazy.

Trump would like us to believe all that red ink was actually a canny business strategy. “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes,” he tweeted after the Times report, adding that “it was sport.”"
McMaster blasts former colleagues as 'danger to the Constitution',https://www.politico.com,['Wesley Morgan'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/08/mcmaster-white-house-danger-to-the-constitution-1418268,"H.R. McMaster’s remarks were a rare public airing of his internal struggles working as the president's second national security adviser. | Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images defense McMaster blasts former colleagues as 'danger to the Constitution'

Former national security adviser H.R. McMaster accused some of his former White House colleagues on Wednesday of being ""a danger to the Constitution"" because they are either trying to manipulate President Donald Trump to push their own agenda or see themselves as rescuing the country from what they view as the commander in chief's bad policy choices.

The retired Army lieutenant general, who served as a top Trump aide between February 2017 and April 2018, cast himself among the group who sought to provide unvarnished policy options to the president. But he said others whom he declined to identify by name had very different agendas — and he said those agendas are dangerous.

“The second group of people, and I think this is true in any administration,” he explained, are those “who are not there to give the president options — they’re there to try to manipulate the situation based on their own agenda, not the president’s agenda.""

The third group of Trump advisers are those who “cast themselves in the role of saving the country, even the world, from the president,"" McMaster told an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish think tank where he is now a scholar.

“I think those latter two categories of people are actually a danger to the Constitution of the United States,” he concluded, explaining that the public servants were not elected to overrule or stymie Trump’s policy desires.

McMaster’s remarks were a rare public airing of his internal struggles working for Trump after he was plucked out of his Army command when the president's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was fired after less than a month.

But he declined to offer his opinion of his successor, John Bolton. Nor did he assess Trump directly.

McMaster did stress that during his time in the White House, he pushed the National Security Council staff to focus on providing information in ways that worked for Trump. “What we can do is understand how the president makes decisions,” he said."
Juan Williams on Trump's tax story: He 'lies to his supporters',https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/juan-williams-on-trumps-tax-story-he-lies-to-his-supporters-its-a-scam,"Fox News' Juan Williams blasted President Trump after The New York Time's reported Tuesday that the president lost over $1 billion in the late 1980s and early '90s.

""Trump lies to his supporters. He says: 'I am a successful businessman, that's why I can run this country better than anyone else. I'll make you rich because I'm rich.' Then it turns out it's a scam. He lost more money than anybody else in America apparently,"" Williams said on ""The Five.""

CNN ANCHORS CELEBRATE TRUMP'S LEAKED TAX DOCS

The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing tax records, that Trump claimed more than $1 billion in losses from his real estate business between 1985 and 1994, but the president claimed Wednesday this was a common practice for developers during that time and largely represented depreciation.

On Wednesday, Trump called the story ""highly inaccurate"" and downplayed the red ink in the documents.

Co-host Greg Gutfeld defended Trump saying: ""He's also made more money. That's what happens. It goes up and down.""

Williams did not buy Gutfeld's argument.

""Let's just pay attention to the fact that the president of the United States may have in fact engaged in tax fraud, bank fraud,"" he said. ""These are serious considerations.""

Williams maintained that Congress should have access to the president's tax records in order to see if the leader could have been compromised by or vulnerable to a foreign entity like Russia.

Co-host Jedediah Bila jumped in and argued that Trump's financial rebound was the story and that no one could deny the president's ""booming economy.'

Bila also noted that her parents had experiences running a business, and it could sometimes be difficult.



Williams argued it was different, calling Trump's situation ""socialism for the rich.""

House Judiciary votes to hold Barr in contempt for defying Mueller report subpoena,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital', 'Grace Segers']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/barr-in-contempt-of-congress-hearing-judiciary-committee-vote-attorney-general-barr-mueller-report-today-2019-05-08/,"After negotiations with the Department of Justice fell apart, House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted to find Attorney General William Barr in contempt for not complying with the panel's subpoenas to provide documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report.

The vote passed along party lines, 24-16, after six hours of contentious debate on the topic. The contempt resolution will now go to the full House for a vote, where it is expected to pass, given the Democratic majority.

""It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives of the American people have chosen to engage in such inappropriate political theatrics,"" the Justice Department said in a statement in response to the vote.

Shortly before vote proceedings began Wednesday morning, the president asserted privilege over the entire Mueller report and underlying documents.

In response to the assertion of executive privilege, Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in his opening statement Wednesday that the administration was ""misapplying the doctrine of executive privilege,"" and called the decision a ""clear escalation in the Trump administration's blanket defiance"" of the constitutional duties of Congress.

""The information we are requesting is entirely in our legal right to receive,"" Nadler said. Democrats are adamant that Barr should turn over the entire unredacted Mueller report and any underlying materials, which the Justice Department has refused. The Department has offered to allow a few members of Congress to view a less redacted version of the report, under the condition that these members do not speak with their colleagues about the report.

""Our fight is about defending the rights of Congress to hold the president -- any president -- accountable,"" Nadler added.

Before the vote, Democrats and Republicans took turns condemning the opposite party for their positions on the Mueller investigation. Republicans like Ranking Member Doug Collins and Rep. Steve Chabot on the committee took the opportunity to condemn committee Democrats' position, and claim that the true scandal was the origins of Mueller's report. GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert called the report an ""attempted coup,"" using the language of President Trump.

Republicans and Democrats also simmered down for a legitimate debate about why they were voting to hold Barr in contempt. Nadler argued that two months of ignored requests for cooperation from the Justice Department was enough time for the committee to justify a contempt vote, while Republicans disagreed.

The committee unanimously approved an amendment proposed by Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz saying that the vote to hold Barr in contempt would not ""be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules."" Republicans argued that the subpoena requested Barr to commit a crime by revealing redacted grand jury material. Democrats said that they only asked for the Justice Department's assistance in court to get that material revealed.

Nadler also called the subpoena ""the beginning of a dialogue,"" as the Justice Department had refused to negotiate ""in good faith,"" which Republicans immediately seized on. The GOP members of the committee argued that Democrats had ended the dialogue by issuing a subpoena.

Democrats opposed two other Republican-proposed amendments to the vote. In a press conference after the vote, Nadler said that Barr's unwillingness to cooperate with House Democrats was a ""constitutional crisis."" When asked whether this crisis required impeachment proceedings, Nadler demurred.

""That may not be the best answer in a constitutional crisis,"" Nadler said.

Nadler warns of ""constitutional crisis"" after Barr contempt vote

Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote a letter to Nadler condemning the contempt vote and asserting executive privilege shortly before the committee proceedings began.

""Unfortunately, rather than allowing negotiations to continue, you scheduled an unnecessary contempt vote, which you refused to postpone to allow additional time for compromise,"" Boyd said.

Barr also wrote a letter to Mr. Trump Wednesday, asking him to ""make a protective assertion of executive privilege with respect to Department of Justice documents recently subpoenaed by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.""

""As with President Clinton's assertion in 1996, you would be making only a preliminary, protective assertion of executive privilege designed to ensure your ability to make a final assertion, if necessary, over some or all of the subpoenaed materials,"" Barr said.

The administration's assertion of executive privilege comes after the Justice Department warned it would ask the president to invoke executive privilege over the entire Mueller report if the committee does not cancel its planned vote, according to a letter from Boyd Tuesday evening.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Washington Post reporter Robert Costa Wednesday morning that she believes Barr should be held in contempt of Congress. She also declined to make a judgment on whether Barr should be impeached, saying that ""nothing is never off the table.""

""For the White House to be degrading the office the president holds, degrading the Constitution of the United States and degrading the first branch of government, the legislative branch, that's just not decent,"" Pelosi said.

Nadler has also threatened to hold former White House lawyer Don McGahn in contempt if he didn't respond to congressional subpoenas for similar documents. The White House has since ordered McGahn not to comply with the subpoena, according to a letter obtained by CBS News."

The president has suggested he doesn’t consider Democratic congressional oversight to be legitimate. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images white house Trump oversight fight raises new alarms about shattered precedents Many say the president is using extreme tactics that could serve as a model for a future president of either party.

President Donald Trump’s increasingly bitter clashes with Congress aren’t just infuriating Democrats and sparking talk of impeachment. They are setting precedents for the exercise of presidential power and authority that could change Washington for years to come.

Past presidents have certainly fought with Congress and invoked executive privilege. They include Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama. But Trump has suggested that he doesn’t consider Democratic congressional oversight itself to be legitimate, and is resisting it on multiple fronts at once.

Story Continued Below

Trump’s actions over 72 hours this week have been dramatic: They include the assertion of executive privilege over the full Mueller report, a refusal to hand over his tax returns, and a move to block his former top White House attorney from testifying before the House. They follow multiple lawsuits he has filed — including against a House Democratic committee chairman — to block the release of personal financial records. He has done it all with the chin-out defiance Trump made his trademark during years of legal battles as a New York real estate mogul.

Taken together, the moves are part of a larger posture of defiance by a president who has flouted countless norms, including those governing congressional prerogatives and oversight. Democratic lawmakers and nonpartisan congressional experts say Trump is writing a playbook for future presidents to ignore Congress’ requests — with the caveat that this ultimately still must play out in the courts.

“This creates a terrible precedent,” said Charles Tiefer, former deputy general counsel of the House of Representatives for 11 years and a professor at the University of Baltimore Law School. “There is a general effect that each president starts out from the level of resistance of the prior president. Trump is raising the bar, and the next president will have that as his model.”

Democrats sound even more dire alarms. “This is unprecedented,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said during a committee session Wednesday, after learning that the Trump White House was blocking lawmaker access to the full Mueller report on executive-privilege grounds. “If allowed to go unchecked, this obstruction means the end of congressional oversight.""

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/405/1155968404_6034225382001_6034221226001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

But the concern doesn’t come from only Democrats, whom Trump accuses of having a politically motivated and therefore invalid agenda. When Trump ended this winter’s government shutdown by invoking a state of emergency to access money for a wall on the Mexican border that Congress would not allocate, even many Republicans warned that Trump was setting the stage for a Democratic successor to follow suit. Their fears were inflamed in February when the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that a future Democratic president could declare a national emergency to tackle gun violence.

Trump himself betrays no concern about overreach, according to fellow Republicans. While his lawyers assert constitutional grounds for his actions, people close to the president say he thinks in very different terms.

“These aren’t, like, impartial people,” Trump said last month after declaring that he was “fighting all the subpoenas” from the House.

“His attitude is, you’re not playing ball with me, I won’t play ball with you,” said one Republican close to the White House. “You said something nasty last night, so screw you. He’s in that mode and it’s very hard for him and he doesn’t have people around him to talk him out of doing that now.”

While Democrats firmly opposed Trump’s February national emergency declaration, they are raising louder alarms about his stiff resistance to oversight efforts by several House committees.

“There's always a tension between the two branches, but I think this has reached a record level where the president won't disclose his tax returns and basically refuse to testify before Mueller and now he's saying there's just going to be no communication,” said Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one of the Senate’s highest-ranking members.

Senior Trump aides believe Democrats’ aggressive oversight amounts to little more than a campaign to ensure the president doesn’t get reelected. They insist privately that what Trump is being subjected to is unlike anything in recent history.

In interviews, multiple White House officials dismissed the notion that the Trump administration is setting a damaging precedent.

“We’re already way past niceties and precedent,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. Asked whether she worries that a future Democratic president could employ the same tactics against a Republican Congress, Conway argued that it is the House Democratic requests that are unprecedented.

“I guess you’re conceding that we can investigate them for nonsense too,” she shot back.

“The Trump administration has accommodated and will continue to accommodate reasonable congressional oversight requests,” said White House spokesman Steven Groves. ""House Democrats, however, habitually demand documents and information they have no legal right to obtain. The White House will continue to protect the interests of the executive branch against unlawful congressional overreach.”

Other Republicans dismissed the idea that the White House and Congress have entered uncharted or precedent-setting territory.

“The relationship between the two branches of government has deteriorated over the past decade or two, but it is not worse now than it was when [Obama Attorney General Eric] Holder was held into contempt. I don’t think it is necessarily related to Trump. It was not that good before,” said C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush and the founding partner of the law firm, Boyden Gray & Associates.

Veterans of past White Houses say the congressional oversight the Trump administration is grappling with is hardly a new phenomenon.

The Obama administration, for example, faced a steady barrage of investigations from House Republicans on everything from the Energy Department’s loan guarantee to the solar company Solyndra to the Operation Fast and Furious gunwalking probe. And in 2012, the House voted to hold Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to turn over documents related to the so-called Fast and Furious probe. That was the first time the House went after a Cabinet official in such an aggressive manner.

“Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) also extolled the constitutional value of oversight, but saw investigations as a way to dismantle government, not improve it,” wrote Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University in a recent study of past House investigations. “Boehner weaponized the investigatory process for maximum political damage.”

In 2007, the George W. Bush administration also faced serious challenges from Congress and tried to bar then-ex White House counsel Harriet Miers from testifying about the firing of U.S. attorneys. Bush, too, asserted executive privilege. Some experts have compared that episode to Trump’s efforts to prevent former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a congressional subpoena.

However, this political moment is different because the high-profile clashes between the executive and legislative branches are happening on multiple fronts at the same time, experts said.

“What I don’t think has happened before is having them all happen at once,” said Andy Wright, a partner at K&L Gates who served as an Obama White House lawyer and a lawyer for Vice President Al Gore.

The Trump White House’s strategy could set a political precedent that would pave the way for future administrations to wholly reject Congress’ requests and subpoenas, Wright said. But the real test will come in the courts, which will determine whether Trump’s strategy is successful.

“What is happening here is there is a rush to the court and a rush to get decisions, and they could set some really difficult precedents down the line,” said Justin Rood, who directs the Project on Government Oversight’s Congressional Oversight Initiative and who previously worked under Republican Sen. Tom Coburn for the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.

But in a sign of these extremely partisan times, Democrats and Republicans hold wholly different takes on the White House’s latest responses to congressional inquiries. Republican lawmakers still remain firmly behind the president including in the Senate, where they hold the majority.

""I'm not concerned about this setting a precedent. I'm just not,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, who previously served as Missouri’s attorney general. “I mean every president evaluates whether he or someday she wants to invoke executive privilege. That's going to happen no matter who is president.""

Many conservatives also believe that this back-and-forth between the White House and House Democrats ultimately will not register with voters heading into the 2020 presidential campaign.

“I don’t believe the average voter in Iowa or Ohio cares very much about this, and the candidates who are running are not jumping into the debate about whether Barr should testify before staff or members,” said Gray, the former White House attorney.

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."

Justice Department charges Deep Dot Web administrators with money laundering – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/doj-deep-dot-web-indictment/,"U.S. prosecutors have formally brought charges against the alleged co-owners and administrators of Deep Dot Web, who were arrested Tuesday.

Tal Prihar, 37, and Michael Phan, 34 — both Israeli citizens — were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to a newly unsealed indictment.

Prihar, who resided in Brazil, was arrested by French police in Paris on Monday, while Phan was arrested by Israeli police in a simultaneous raid.

The two are accused of making millions of dollars in commission from Deep Dot Web, a website featuring news, reviews and information about dark web sites and marketplaces. Prosecutors said the administrators made their commission by linking to marketplaces on the dark web — only accessible through Tor, an encrypted anonymity network.

Many of the dark web marketplaces sold drugs, weapons and stolen data, which hackers could use to break into online accounts.

A staffer at Deep Dot Web said in a Medium post following the arrests that Deep Dot Web would generate a slice of the revenue from purchases made on dark web marketplaces, said to be as much as 4%. Brazil’s federal police said in a statement the site made millions in dollars in cryptocurrency from referral sales from more than 15,000 dark web users.

Following the arrests, the FBI seized Deep Dot Web’s website.

“It was truly a 50:50 partnership between the two defendants,” said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference in Pittsburgh on Wednesday announcing the charges.

According to the district attorney, more than 23% of all transactions made on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace taken down by authorities in 2017, were associated with a referral link from Deep Dot Web. The indictment also said Deep Dot Web referred more than 198,000 users to Hansa, another defunct market, accounting for nearly half of the site’s users, of which Deep Dot Web “received a commission on all of those users’ purchases.”

The indictment said Prihar and Phan made about 8,155 bitcoins in total — almost half of which was collected from AlphaBay. Prosecutors said at its peak, the bitcoins were worth more than $15.4 million.

“This is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,” said Brady."

Congress Has a Right to See Trump’s Tax Returns.",https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/trump-tax-returns-congress.html,"As to whether Congress may obtain a president’s tax returns, there is no ambiguity : Federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to submit a written request to the Treasury Department , which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, for “any return or return information.” The Treasury secretary then “shall furnish” the requested information to the committee so that it may conduct its legislative functions.

Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary on Monday rebuffed just such a request from Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years’ worth of federal tax returns for President Trump and several of his companies.

The purpose of the request was not “harassment” of the president, as Mr. Trump and his defenders have branded efforts by Democratic House members to perform legitimate oversight functions. Rather, as Mr. Neal told the I.R.S., the committee “is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.”

In a letter responding to Mr. Neal on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin said he consulted with the Justice Department and determined that the chairman’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that the Treasury Department “may not lawfully fulfill the committee’s request.”"
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-homing-in-on-fbis-use-of-unverified-steele-dossier,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility.""

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele, described as a “key source”, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz’s broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.

Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.

The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.” And a specific focus of Horowitz’s team is apparently “a news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele’s credibility… [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.”

The “news report” was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele’s credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said “it’s self-referential” and “it seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.”

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff’s “old friend” Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.

Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele’s information. “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from,” Isikoff said. “We knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That’s thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.”

In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn’t think Steele was Isikoff’s source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.

The Wall Street Journal report says “investigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele’s credibility that found his reporting had been ‘minimally corroborated’ even as it also said he had provided information ‘of value’ to the U.S. intelligence community.” The report says “the evaluation was reflected in a ‘human source validation report’ written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016… because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.”

Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his “handling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”

According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele’s dossier, claiming that “to our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.”

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago… It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.” A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including its allegation from ""Kremlin insiders"" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
Why Trump's claim of executive privilege is different,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/donald-trump-executive-privilege/index.html,"(CNN) Maybe what's going on with Trump and Congress and executive privilege is relatively tame, since it has to do only with a report on allegations of Russian election interference and obstruction of justice.

When President Thomas Jefferson argued in 1807 that he didn't have to fully comply with a subpoena for documents, he was having his former vice president tried for treason for attempting to incite a revolution out West. The former-vice-president-turned-frontier-revolutionary on trial was Aaron Burr, of ""Hamilton"" dueling fame. The Supreme Court, in the voice of Jefferson's foil Chief Justice John Marshall, disagreed with the President's argument, Jefferson ultimately coughed up the documents Burr wanted for his defense and Burr ultimately walked free.

Fast-forward 170 years, and Chief Justice Warren Burger used the Burr trial in deciding that President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena by the special counsel for his taped Oval Office conversations.

None of these cases are exactly the same. Jefferson was responding to a subpoena in a criminal trial. Nixon was responding to a subpoena by a special prosecutor. Trump, in invoking a blanket claim of executive privilege Wednesday, was responding to a subpoena from Congress for the Mueller report.

But they all share the idea that presidents should be able to keep secrets from Congress in order to do their jobs. The term itself -- executive privilege -- dates back only to the Eisenhower administration. And while it isn't in the Constitution, the idea has been a matter of considerable debate since George Washington first employed it with regard to congressional inquiries about the postwar Jay Treaty of 1795 between the US and Great Britain.

This is not a secret or under-analyzed subject. Books upon books have been written about it and just about every recent generation has had a knock-down crisis moment fight about it, particularly when presidents have used the idea of executive privilege to cover up missteps.

During his 1807 trial for treason, former vice president Aaron Burr subpoenaed documents from President Thomas Jefferson.

""The weakest claims of executive privilege involve administrations attempting to cover up embarrassing or politically inconvenient information, or even outright wrongdoing,"" write Mark Rozell of George Mason University and Mitchel Sollenberger of the University of Michigan-Dearborn in one study

They point out, however, that there is a sound need for the president to get candid advice and also to keep information from the public.

""Presidents rely heavily on being able to consult with advisers, without fear of public disclosure of their deliberations,"" write Rozell and Sollenberger. ""Executive privilege recognizes this notion. Indeed, in U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court not only recognized the constitutionality of executive privilege, but the occasional need for secrecy to the operation of the presidency.""

A brief history

In his memoirs, Nixon expressed regret that he had weakened the principle.

""I was the first president to test the principle of executive privilege in the Supreme Court, and by testing it on such a weak ground, I probably ensured the defeat of my cause,"" he wrote.

There has been an ebb and flow ever since.

Bill Clinton tried to use it more than any other president since Watergate as he fought the Whitewater investigation and dealt with fallout from the Monica Lewinsky affair, President Ronald Reagan sought to expand the idea.Bill Clinton tried to use it more than any other president since Watergate as he fought the Whitewater investigation and dealt with fallout from the Monica Lewinsky affair, according to the academics . He ultimately dropped the claim of executive privilege in regard to testimony to Congress about Lewinsky.

Congress considered but ultimately did not move on an impeachment charge against Clinton having to do with abuse of executive privilege, according to Rozell and Sollenberger. Clinton invoked executive privilege 14 times, according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service in 2012, more than twice the tally of any other modern president.

(Yes, Congress can technically arrest people, but it hasn't tried in more than 70 years.) President George W. Bush tried to expand it even further and strengthen the power of the presidency. He signed an executive order that gave the current president the ability to assert executive privilege over the documents of previous presidents. He also got into snits with Congress over using the idea to shield top aides like Karl Rove from congressional testimony. Back then, CNN's Jim Acosta reported on where Congress might put someone like Rove in jail if it tried to arrest him (Yes, Congress can technically arrest people, but it hasn't tried in more than 70 years.)

President Barack Obama made a big deal of rolling back Bush's view of executive privilege, but then he asserted it himself on behalf of his attorney general, Eric Holder, who was held in contempt of court over the Fast and Furious gun sale scandal . A federal judge ultimately made Holder turn over documents.

Trump's claim is different

Trump's assertion, however, is a blanket assertion of privilege for anything relating to the special counsel report on the Russia investigation. It's nontraditional in some ways, since privilege is usually asserted for close aides and in Trump's case it is for an investigation into his administration and 2016 political campaign. It's also very broad, and seemingly pertains in a protective way to all congressional inquiries related to Mueller.

""This protective assertion of executive privilege ensures the President's ability to make a final decision whether to assert privilege following a full review of these materials,"" wrote Stephen Boyd, a Justice Department official, in a letter Wednesday to the House Judiciary Committee.

""Executive privilege claims customarily come with an underlying rationale such as national security, protecting internal deliberations or protecting ongoing DOJ investigations,"" Rozell told CNN in an email. ""In this case the President has claimed some 'protective' executive privilege which is entirely too broad and without any precedent (excepting equally broad claims such as President Nixon's that failed the constitutional standard). It seems the President believes he can wall off any and all information or testimony by merely uttering the words 'executive privilege.' ""

One problem for Democrats right now is that they have asked for essentially every document related to the Mueller report, something they may not ever get.

Timothy Naftali, a New York University historian who's the former head of the Nixon presidential library, said Wednesday on CNN that they should be more specific and detailed in their requests.

""I think at this moment a lot of Americans are just seeing the Republicans and Democrats screaming at each other, and the details -- which are so important -- are being lost,"" he said, arguing that Trump is making his broad claim of privilege because he thinks most people will see only the political back and forth rather than understand what, specifically, Democrats are trying to get.

""Usually disputes over executive privilege get resolved through an accommodation process between Congress and the White House,"" Rozell observed. ""We seem to be stuck now in a zero-sum game with each side digging in.""

Regardless, this is now a fight destined for the courts. And these things take time. It took a year from the time Nixon refused to release the tapes till the Supreme Court ruled against him. It was four years from the time Obama made his executive privilege claim regarding Fast and Furious before a judge rejected it . And even then the legal fight over the documents continued into the Trump administration"
"In Rare Bipartisan Move, Reps. Adam Schiff and Devin Nunes Threaten to Subpoena DOJ for Mueller Files",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Hanna Trudo'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/in-rare-bipartisan-move-reps-adam-schiff-and-devin-nunes-threaten-to-subpoena-doj-for-mueller-files,"The House Intelligence Committee’s Democratic chairman and Republican ranking member are threatening to hit the Justice Department with a rare bipartisan subpoena if the department doesn’t hand over testimony and briefing materials produced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia investigation.

In a letter dated April 25, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray to complain that the “Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee ‘fully and currently informed’” of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information obtained in the course of Mueller’s investigation. Schiff and Nunes expressed concerns that the Department and Bureau also failed to the address the committee’s prior request for Mueller to testify before the committee.

“In addition to the complete unredacted report, the Committee’s request includes all classified and unclassified evidence and information obtained or generated by the Special Counsel’s Office that may relate to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence matters,” the letter states.

The request also includes information regarding “efforts by the Russian government to contact Americans in furtherance of Russian intelligence objectives,” and says it is “unique and distinct from the House Judiciary Committee’s independent interest in obtaining the unredacted report and underlying evidence.”

Schiff and Nunes set a May 2 deadline, warning that “the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee’s request” if the deadline is not met.

Reached by phone on Tuesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told The Daily Beast that the committee has now started to proceed through the compulsory part of the process. “The extraordinary thing is that it’s bipartisan,” Khanna said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) told The Daily Beast the House committee’s letter was necessary because “we need to know if there’s an ongoing threat to our national security.”

“The Mueller Report found 200 pages of contacts between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians. But not once did it say these disturbing contacts ceased,” he said."
California moves to ban farm pesticide that Trump's EPA has defended,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Jeff Daniels', 'Damian Dovarganes']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/california-moves-to-ban-farm-pesticide-that-trumps-epa-has-defended.html,"LOS ANGELES — California regulators moved Wednesday to ban chlorpyrifos, a controversial pesticide used on almond, citrus and grape crops in the nation's largest agricultural state.

California's planned ban follows Hawaii and New York announcing similar moves against chlorpyrifos, a widely used chemical in farming that environmentalists claim is harmful to children and farmworkers.

Chlorpyrifos is manufactured by DowDuPont, which has insisted the pesticide is safe. Dow has lobbied the Trump administration to keep chlorpyrifos available for crops.

California plans to phase out the use of the pesticide statewide in a process that could take up to two years. New York lawmakers approved a ban April 30 that would end the use of chlorpyrifos in the state by 2021, while Hawaii's ban, announced last year, won't take effect until late 2022.

""California's action to cancel the registration of chlorpyrifos is needed to prevent the significant harm this pesticide causes children, farm workers and vulnerable communities,"" Jared Blumenfeld, secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, or CalEPA, said in a statement. ""This action also represents a historic opportunity for California to develop a new framework for alternative pest management practices.""

According to CalEPA, ""the decision to ban chlorpyrifos follows mounting evidence, including recent findings by the state's independent Scientific Review Panel on Toxic Air Contaminants, that the pesticide causes serious health effects in children and other sensitive populations at lower levels of exposure than previously understood. These effects include impaired brain and neurological development.""

In April, CalEPA regulators formally listed chlorpyrifos as a ""toxic air contaminant,"" meaning the state believed it ""may pose a present or potential hazard to human health."" It said the move was done ""to protect the health of farm workers and others living and working near where the pesticide is used.""

CalEPA said Wednesday that chlorpyrifos use has declined in California in the past decade as farmers ""have shifted to safer alternatives."" It said use of the pesticide dropped more than 50% from 2 million pounds in 2005 to just over 900,000 pounds in 2016.

In March 2017, the Trump administration moved to show its support for chlorpyrifos. Then-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected an attempt to ban the pesticide for use on food crops such as fruits, vegetables and nuts.

The largest agricultural market currently for chlorpyrifos is corn, according to the agency.

In 2016 the federal EPA, under President Barack Obama, moved to restrict use of chlorpyrifos after being petitioned by several environmental groups. Dow challenged the agency, saying its ""assessment lacks scientific vigor.""

In supporting chlorpyrifos, Dow previously has said ""growers face limited or no viable alternatives to chlorpyrifos. When an outbreak of a new pest occurs, growers look to chlorpyrifos as a proven first-line of defense.""

DowDuPont did not immediately reply to CNBC's request for comment Wednesday.

Chlorpyrifos is used in more than 90 countries. Most household uses of the chemical ended in 2000, but it has remained popular in farming."
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
"Top US general: Pentagon, DHS working on 'multiyear plan' for border",https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442758-top-us-general-pentagon-dhs-working-on-multi-year-plan-for-border,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said that the Pentagon is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a “multiyear plan"" for the border, suggesting that active duty and National Guard troops will be deployed to the southern border for the remainder of President’s Trump's first term.

“What we’re hopeful to do is to have, in fairly short order, for the secretary of Homeland Security, a much more predictable, comprehensive plan for the next couple years,” Gen. Joseph Dunford said during a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing.

The Defense Department has provided a two-star general “plus a number of planners” to DHS “to “lay out the next couple of years.”

Dunford said the so-called interagency planning team will prepare around the number of migrants expected to come to the southern U.S. border, the capacity of DHS to handle the migrants and the expected support DHS will need from the rest of the government.

“Although the commitment to the border hasn’t impacted our preparedness for other missions at this point, what we wanted to do is get into a more predictable mode of the requirements that the Department of Homeland Security has and do better at integrating across the government,” Dunford said.

There are now about 4,364 U.S. service member at the border, a mix of active-duty and National Guard members, according to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who testified alongside Dunford.

About 1,167 of the service members are performing the primary role of monitoring and detection, but a broader set of missions range from logistical support to aviation support to food service.

The administration has said troops will stay at such posts until DHS “no longer requires [Department of Defense] support to secure the southern border.”

As of last month, the deployment is expected to cost at least $534 million by the end of the fiscal year in September.

Late last month, Shanahan approved a DHS request to send about 320 more military personnel to help with handling migrants entering the United States, easing restrictions on troops interacting with migrants.

In addition, the Army Corps of Engineer is currently on contract to build about 256 miles of barrier.

“How you will see this materialize in the next six months is about 63 new miles of wall will come online, so about half a mile a day will be produced,” Shanahan said."
"By protecting Trump, Republicans risk limiting their ability to hold future Democratic presidents accountable",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/by-protecting-trump-republicans-risk-limiting-their-ability-to-hold-future-democratic-presidents-accountable,"Republicans ready to go to bat for President Trump in his ongoing battle to deny the requests of House Democrats risk limiting the ability of Republicans in Congress to hold future Democratic presidents accountable.

To be sure, it is not in the interest of Americans to allow the Congress to cripple any presidency by endless demands for documents and official testimony to investigate any claims that can be ginned up for political reasons. But at the same time, it is counter to the public interest to allow the executive branch to blanketly deny Congressional investigators access to relevant information, and thus escape accountability. There are a lot of gray areas between these extremes, and every administration, in one way or another, tests the boundaries. Our system, in an awkward way, has tried to establish some sort of balance.

As those in the opposition soon discover, the reality is that congressional oversight power is limited. A congressional subpoena, or a contempt finding such as the one Democrats are voting for today with regards to Attorney General William Barr, is not as powerful as a criminal one issued by a court of law, nor does it have the same implications. If the executive branch digs in, Congress runs out of tools in its box. It can take the administration to court, as Democrats plan to do with Trump’s tax returns, but then court proceedings can delay the release of information for years, well after they lose political relevance.

During the Obama administration, Republican investigators were frustrated by then-Attorney General Eric Holder’s refusal to hand over documents related to the botched Fast and Furious operation, in which thousands of guns were allowed to “walk” into Mexico, where they ended up in the hands of drug cartels and were linked to the death of a U.S. border patrol agent. Holder, who lied in congressional testimony , also hid behind executive privilege in releasing documents, and was held in contempt. But his Department of Justice still dragged its feet in turning over documents, even after court orders. It wasn’t until 2018, six years after the Congressional contempt finding, that the Jeff Sessions-led Justice Department announced it was handing over all of the documents. There are also plenty of examples of Bill Clinton and his Justice Department trying to stymie investigations, for instance, the one into potential campaign finance violations in his 1996 reelection campaign.

This isn’t to focus on one side. There are examples from the Reagan and Bush administrations, and of course, the Nixon administration of Republican presidents trying to thwart congressional investigations.

The reason I raise this is that the history of previous Democratic administrations fighting congressional document requests is that they have made Republicans feel more justified in defending him in disputes with the Democratic House.

Republicans should be aware, however, that any principles that Trump establishes in rebuffing congressional investigators could be used (or further built upon) by future Democratic presidents seeking to avoid scrutiny from Republicans in Congress. Republicans should not see defending Trump on every matter as necessary, even if they believe that the Robert Mueller report vindicated him on the Russia issue.

There are two aspects of Trump’s defiance that I find particularly worrisome.

One is the specific issue of Trump’s tax returns. I’ve called on him to release his tax returns ever since the 2016 campaign, and still believe he ought to in the name of transparency, and this is true even if he can convince a court that he is not obligated to hand them over to Congress.

The public should be able to have an understanding of where the president’s income is coming from and what his taxes look like. That Trump entered the presidential race in a unique position as a man with a global business empire and that he has complicated taxes should not be an excuse not to release them. It’s actually a stronger argument in favor of making them public.

Americans should be able to get a firm idea of Trump’s business dealings, of potential conflicts of interest, and of potential avenues through which foreign governments can try to gain influence by way of businesses. This is important independently of the motivations that Democrats have in trying to use them to embarrass him politically.

For over three years , Trump has argued that he cannot release his tax returns while he’s under audit. In reality, even if we take him at his word that he has been under perpetual audit, nothing would prevent him from releasing tax returns while under audit, nor should it have any bearing on whether he releases taxes from years unaffected by the claimed audit.

There is no law requiring presidents to hand over their tax returns, though that has been the modern practice. Barack Obama released his tax returns, yet many conservatives were fixated by his refusal to release his college records. Trump got in on the action just ahead of the 2012 election , offering Obama $5 million to a charity of his choice, stating, ""President Obama is the least transparent president in the history of this country."" Whatever biographical details some conservatives thought Obama’s college records would reveal, they are clearly less relevant to his presidency than Trump’s sources of income.

If Trump is able to rebuff congressional investigators by successfully arguing in court that their demand for his tax returns does not serve a legislative purpose , it will create a disincentive for future presidents — including Democratic ones — to release their tax returns if they contain any information that could potentially be politically damaging.

Another aspect of Trump’s posture that’s worrisome is his blanket statement, “We’re fighting all the subpoenas .""

As noted above, there are plenty of examples of presidents invoking executive privilege to block congressional requests for documents or official testimony. But there is a difference between invoking privilege in each individual case, for specific reasons, and declaring an intention up front to be broadly uncooperative because members of the popularly elected opposition party “ aren’t impartial people .”

Again, if Trump is able to set a standard under which presidents can broadly declare their intention not to cooperate with congressional investigations, this standard will inevitably come back to haunt Republicans.

The standoff between Trump and Democrats should be viewed independently of current political considerations and seen as part of a much larger battle over the powers of congressional oversight and the executive branch. Republicans need to consider what they believe the proper balance should be if a Democrat were in power, and act accordingly."
Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442716-dems-want-asbestos-ban-now-epa-says-it-needs-more-time,"House Democrats hope to sidestep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a bill that would ban asbestos within a year.

In a Wednesday hearing before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, Democrats grilled EPA chemical staff on why the agency hasn’t taken more restrictive actions on the harmful substance three years after passing a law to give the agency more authority to regulate dangerous chemicals.

“I wish today’s hearing wasn’t necessary and this bill wasn't necessary, but asbestos is still being imported into the U.S. and still being used in this country, and still killing about 40,000 Americans every year,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban Dem senators call for probe into EPA officials over memo language MORE (D-N.J.). ADVERTISEMENT

The EPA has been under heavy criticism for its latest action on asbestos, something the agency argues will limit the use of asbestos in the U.S. but critics say could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

The agency has resisted calls to ban the cancer-causing substance outright, even against the wishes of some of its staff, arguing it must continue to go through its risk evaluation process, even if lengthier than some might prefer.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that senior EPA officials ignored the advice of scientists and lawyers in restricting rather than banning asbestos.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote in a memo from August.

The memo alarmed subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord MORE (D-N.Y.).

“Based on some of these communications it seems clear that numerous EPA career staff believe the agency is not fully pursuing efforts to reduce asbestos exposure, and I hope these expert voices have a role as the process moves forward,” he said.

Asbestos is still sometimes used in the construction of roads and production of chlorine, among other products, but more than 60 countries have banned the use of the substance or products that contain it.

“The U.S. must do the same,” argued Tonko, but “I have little confidence that EPA will move forward on a reasonable timeline with the only acceptable outcome: a complete asbestos ban.”

Congress banned asbestos in 1989 but a court overturned that law in 1991, allowing limited uses of asbestos to continue.

Committee Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, trying to sidestep a science-based EPA process that could help the agency avoid future litigation.

“Let me be honest here. If a Democrat was in the White House right now, my Democratic colleagues would be very skeptical of me trying to overturn a chemical review,” said ranking member John Shimkus John Mondy ShimkusDems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord A conservative climate plan will build on personal responsibility while reducing emissions MORE (R-Ill.).

“I’m concerned about the immediate loss of 36 percent — that’s over one third — of our national chlorine production” and the risk that would pose to hospitals and drinking water supplies, he said.

For its part, the EPA continues to stress that its rule is the first meaningful action on asbestos in 30 years.

Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, told the committee the rule is an “aggressive and critical step” in addressing asbestos, stressing the need to go through a measured process in considering the risk factors associated with asbestos.

Dunn told The Hill in April that the agency may eventually ban asbestos.

Committee Democrats made clear they have lost faith in Dunn’s office under the Trump administration.

“Unfortunately, it’s now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the Trump EPA is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals,” Pallone Jr. said, adding that EPA’s actions “have been so legally suspect we need to pass this bill regardless of whether EPA were to announce it’s moving forward with a full ban of asbestos.”"

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

Obama DHS secretary pulls out of commencement speech after opposition to immigration policies: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/442682-obama-dhs-secretary-pulls-out-of-usc-commencement-speech-after-opposition-to,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has reportedly withdrawn as commencement speaker for the University of Southern California’s (USC) law school, citing concerns about his enforcement of the Obama administration’s immigration policy.

""I informed Secretary Johnson that some faculty and students have raised concerns about the immigration policies of the Obama administration and, therefore, about having him as our commencement speaker,” Dean Andrew Guzman said in an email to faculty and staff, according to Inside Higher Ed. “Secretary Johnson shared with me that he believes that graduations should be free of tension and political controversy and for this reason has decided not to speak.”

Johnson served as head of the Department of Homeland Security from December 2013 through the end of former President Obama’s second term.

In April, two Chicano professors at USC's Gould School of Law wrote to express disappointment with Johnson’s invitation, noting his part in the detention of migrants fleeing an uptick in violence in Central America in 2014, as well as his arguments against judicial review of “kill lists” of combatants when he served as general counsel for the Department of Defense.

""USC’s choice to invite Secretary Johnson to speak normalizes illegal state violence. Inviting him to speak to the graduating class legitimates what federal courts and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have recognized as a fundamental betrayal of core values,” wrote professors Daria Roithmayr and David B. Cruz. “Johnson has repeatedly failed to respect legal and moral limits on the use of government-sponsored coercive force, particularly against children, and has demonstrated a morally repugnant willingness to use those who are most vulnerable among us as means to an end."""
"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

David Bernhardt listens during a White House meeting in April. (Chris Kleponis/Pool via Bloomberg)

He acknowledged climate change is real. He acknowledged that humans are contributing to it.

So why, Democratic lawmakers asked David Bernhardt, isn't he doing more to address global warming?

Apparently, because Congress hasn't told him to.

During his first testimony to Congress since becoming interior secretary, Bernhardt said it is up to lawmakers to direct bureaucrats like himself to address the causes and effects of warming globally.

The punt back to lawmakers is likely to frustrate House Democrats who are trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire on climate change, since they know that any significant climate-related legislation to emerge from their chamber is likely to be rejected by either the president or the GOP-controlled Senate. At the same time, Democrats have only passed a single climate bill — one keeping the United States in the Paris climate accord — since taking the the majority.

The exchange came when Democrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Interior Department's budget pressed the Trump Cabinet official about why his department isn't doing more to assess and mitigate the effects of warming temperatures, acidifying oceans and other effects of climate change over the vast lands and waters stewarded by the Interior Department.

“Isn’t this really your job?” asked Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine).

Bernhardt pushed back against the assertion, arguing he has no legal obligation to act in response to climate change. ""My perspective on this is probably a little different than yours,"" he said.

He noted that of more than 600 instances in the law mandating the interior secretary to take some action, none tell him that he ""shall,"" as is the legal parlance, manage federal lands to stop global warming.

""There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said. ""You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

Pingee responded by asking Bernhardt to identify any legal barriers to acting on climate change. ""If there’s something legally stopping you, then we’re Congress,” she said. ""We make the laws.""

It is a lawyerly defense Bernhardt has turned to before, including in an interview last year with The Washington Post. Yet law or no law, climate change remains a threat to the land the Interior Department is tasked with overseeing.

In the national park system alone, warming temperatures threaten to undermine the very nature of many popular tourist spots, such as by melting the glaciers of Montana's Glacier National Park and imperilling the iconic Joshua trees of California's Joshua Tree National Park.

And the department holds considerable sway of the United States' overall contributions to climate change. A U.S. Geological Survey study published last year found that a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

Yet in the more than two years Donald Trump has been president, the Interior Department has sought to undo much of the previous administration's efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere undergirding that change.

Its action include rolling back rules designed to reduce the release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, from oil and natural gas wells and lifting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands.

During the hearing, Bernhardt said his department does not plan on easing up on oil and gas drilling on public lands when asked by Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the subcommittee’s chairwoman, if a recent United Nations report on the possible extinction of up to 1 million species worldwide gives him pause.

""Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,"" he said, again noting it is up to Congress to decide what the government does or does not allow on federal lands.

But when it came to the issue of drilling for oil and gas off the coasts of states outside the Gulf of Mexico, Bernhardt suggested he would give deference to local leaders.

""I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The department has put on pause plans to expand offshore drilling across the U.S. continental shelf after a recent federal court ruled against the Trump administration's effort to lift a current drilling ban in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. That decision came amid stiff opposition to offshore drilling from both Democratic and Republican politicians along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

Who's winning in California vs. Trump? Gilliam’s ruling is just the latest in a slew of environmental cases California has brought against the administration. And the Los Angeles Times reports the state is winning in nearly all of its efforts.

The Trump administration is looking to add emergency border funding to a disaster aid bill, a new obstacle that has further complicated ongoing negotiations over the multibillion-dollar disaster legislation, The Post’s Erica Werner reports. An ongoing feud between the president and congressional Democrats over Puerto Rico spending has already stalled negotiations. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) made a plea this week to Vice President Pence, who joined Senate Republicans for a closed-door lunch to talk about the disaster bill, that the introduction of a new spending element could tangle negotiations further.

Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which has been moving forward with carbon capture technology, is one company that has had success in raising money. But the Times writes the “current wave of internet-focused start-ups going public, and reaping billions of dollars for investors, has hardened the bias against so-called hard technology…In the time it took Carbon Engineering to raise one round of $68 million, Slack, a messaging company founded the same year, has raised more than 10 times as much and is now preparing for an initial public offering that could value it at nearly $20 billion.”

There are not many workers,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who did the cost calculation, told The Post’s Heather Long. Some Republicans and business leaders had hoped the president would have already removed the tariffs, and congressional Republicans have continued to pressure the administration to remove them “at least on Canada and Mexico, which are major feeders of metals to the United States,” Long adds.

On Tuesday, Volkswagen’s Porsche division announced it agreed to a 535 million euro, or $600 million, fine after German officials accused the car maker of selling almost 100,000 diesel SUVs with software meant to conceal excess emissions. Just a few months before, Kappanna, whose most recent role at G.M. was to communicate with the EPA about the company’s emissions technology, was called into a conference room to be let go. He received a severance package with two months of pay and a one-way ticket to India, where he returned soon after because he couldn’t find work before his 60-day grace period expired.

The House Judiciary Committee will proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed late Monday, as the Justice Department attempts to fend off the effort ahead of a negotiating session with the Democratic-led committee on Tuesday.

Nadler's firm stance comes as he seeks punitive actions against the attorney general for defying a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report on the Russia investigation and its underlying evidence. It also comes hours after the Justice Department put forward a last-ditch plea to negotiate with the panel, offering a Wednesday meeting but later agreeing to Nadler’s demand for a Tuesday sit-down.

Story Continued Below

“At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand,” Nadler said in a statement. “My hope is that we make concrete progress at tomorrow’s meeting towards resolving this dispute. The committee remains committed to finding a reasonable accommodation.”

In a letter to Nadler earlier Monday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd invited the chairman to a negotiation session on Wednesday to discuss an “acceptable accommodation” that would potentially give more lawmakers access to a less-redacted version of the report, in addition to “possible disclosure of certain materials” cited in Mueller’s report.

Boyd’s letter came hours after the committee took its first formal step toward holding Barr in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when Nadler announced that it planned to consider a contempt citation against Barr on Wednesday morning.

A vote of approval from the Democrat-led committee would send the measure to the full House for consideration later this month. Nadler said he would put the contempt proceedings on hold if the Justice Department engages in a “good-faith” effort to give Democrats access to the requested information.

“The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Nadler said in a statement before the DOJ released its letter.

Democrats have argued that the redacted version Barr made public last month is insufficient to consider a potential congressional response to Mueller's findings, particularly his evidence that President Donald Trump attempted to thwart the investigation.

The committee launched its own obstruction of justice investigation against the president earlier this year. The contempt citation explicitly mentions that probe, which is also centered on allegations of “public corruption and other abuses of power” by the president.

“Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight, and legislative functions,” the citation states.

The contempt citation also references the Justice Department’s long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, noting that Mueller accepted those guidelines in declining to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

“Congress is therefore the only body able to hold the president to account for improper conduct in our tripartite system, and urgently requires the subpoenaed material to determine whether and how to proceed with its constitutional duty to provide checks and balances on the president and executive branch,” the citation states. “Otherwise, the president remains insulated from legal consequences and sits above the law.”

The Justice Department said last week it would not comply with the committee’s subpoena for the unredacted report and the underlying evidence, arguing that it amounts to illegitimate congressional oversight. Nadler gave Barr until Monday morning to respond to an augmented offer; the Justice Department did not respond to that offer, and has maintained that it would be violating the law if it complied with the Democrats’ request.

Boyd slammed Nadler for refusing to view the less-redacted version of Mueller’s report, which still includes redactions of grand-jury information. Boyd said Nadler’s refusal “naturally raises questions about the sincerity of the committee’s interest in and purported need for the redacted material.”

All six House and Senate Democrats declined to read the less-redacted version of the report offered to a select group of senior lawmakers, arguing that the offer should have included dozens more members of the committees investigating matters connected to Mueller's findings.

In response to the formal contempt notice on Monday, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called Nadler’s move “illogical and disingenuous” because the Justice Department is still negotiating with the panel.

“Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement.

Democrats have been demanding Mueller's complete report and underlying evidence for months, a call that intensified after Mueller submitted his findings to Barr in late March. But Barr held on to the report for a month while he reviewed and redacted it for several categories of sensitive information. The public version of the report he released contained limited redactions but included none of Mueller's underlying material — evidence Democrats say they need to determine whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Though Mueller concluded that he lacked sufficient evidence to prove any Americans aided the vast Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election, he described repeated efforts by Trump to sideline the investigation altogether and to encourage witnesses to refrain from full cooperation.

Mueller did not formally conclude that Trump obstructed justice — a determination he said was largely a result of the DOJ restrictions against indicting a sitting president — but Barr has since used Mueller's evidence to absolve Trump of the potential crime.

Barr testified for five hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and described sharp disagreements with the legal theories undergirding Mueller's findings — including whether Trump's tweets can be persuasive evidence of obstruction and suggesting Mueller told him privately, despite not indicating it in his report, that his obstruction decision was not based on the longstanding DOJ restriction.

Barr skipped a hearing House Democrats had called last Thursday after his aides objected to Democrats' request to allow committee lawyers from both parties to question Barr for 30 minutes each. Democrats previously authorized Nadler to subpoena Barr a second time to compel his appearance before their committee, though he hasn't issued it yet.

The impact of a contempt citation could be simply symbolic. Republicans held Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents. Some Democrats have floated the possibility of using punitive enforcement mechanisms against Barr for defying their subpoena, including levying fines against the attorney general.

Shareholders Demand To Know How Northrop Grumman Will Protect Human Rights While Building Massive DHS Database,https://www.eff.org,"['Jason Kelley', 'Jyoti Panday']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/shareholders-northrop-grumman-demand-know-how-company-will-protect-human-rights,"Over the next few years, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to implement an enormous biometric collection program which will endanger the rights of citizens and foreigners alike. The agency intends to collect at least seven types of biometric identifiers, including face and voice data, DNA, scars, and tattoos, often from questionable sources, and from innocent people.

But DHS isn’t building all of the technology: Northrop Grumman, a defense contractor, won the nearly 100 million-dollar, 42-month contract to “develop increments one and two” of the project, named HART (Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology). Now, a group of concerned investors are demanding that the Board of Directors of the company explain how they will protect human rights while building the tech behind the massive, privacy-invasive database.

It’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project.

The Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment (Tri-CRI) filed the shareholder resolution in November after discussions with company management failed. The resolution asks the board to explain how the company will abide by its human rights policy, which reflects the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, while building a database that will greatly expand DHS’s ability to surveil innocent people. Their fears are well-founded: as EFF reported, HART will chill and deter people from exercising their First Amendment protected rights to speak, assemble, and associate—all rights also recognized under the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights, and presumably, by Northrop Grumman’s policy. If it is serious about its commitment to human rights, the shareholders say, the company must step up and explain how it squares that commitment with the harms inherent in this project. Voting on the resolution will take place May 15.

According to Northrop Grumman’s press release, “HART will offer a more accurate, robust way to identify adversaries” using “advanced, proven technologies.” But far from being proven or accurate, face recognition—one of the first components of HART to be built, and which DHS intends to rely on to identify people across a variety of its mission areas—has a high rate of inaccuracy, even according to DHS’s tests of its own systems, and is known to misidentify people of color and women at higher rates than others. In their shareholder resolution, Tri-CRI lay this out in addition to other harms posed by the technology:

There are concerns that the algorithms used to identify facial images that may be stored in the database have inherent racial bias. The HART database will amplify the surveillance capabilities of government agencies, presenting risks to privacy and First Amendment rights and causing harm to immigrant communities. Through the provision of services through the DHS contract, Northrop Grumman may be linked or contribute to these adverse human rights impacts.

Shareholders aren’t alone in their concerns with this technology: a coalition of over 85 groups across a spectrum of civil society recently demanded that other companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google halt all governmental sales of face recognition technology. Amazon faces similar shareholder action later this month. And the pushback isn’t just coming from advocacy groups. Senators have asked DHS to pause at least one aspect of the HART program—the use of facial recognition in airports—until a proper rulemaking. The OIG is investigating the proposal as well, to “assess whether biometric data collected at pilot locations has improved DHS's ability to verify departures.” The Government Accountability Office has criticized the reliability of DHS’s data, and Congress even withheld funds in previous years from DHS’s Office of Biometric Identity Management. Even major cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, are considering permanent bans on any city department utilizing facial recognition technology—an indicator of how dangerous the technology is.

Facial recognition isn’t the only problem with HART. EFF filed comments criticizing DHS’s plan to collect, store, and share the biometric and biographic records it receives from external agencies, and to exempt this information from the federal Privacy Act, making it difficult if not impossible for individuals to review the data collected. In addition, the broad, vague scope of DHS’s proposal makes it exceedingly difficult for the American public to track and comment on the over-collection and overuse of biometric data.

Other data DHS is planning to collect—including information about people’s “relationship patterns” and from officer “encounters” with the public—can be used to identify political affiliations, religious activities, and familial and friendly relationships. These data points are also frequently colored by conjecture and bias. This, combined with the fact that the biometric data will be shared with federal agencies outside of DHS, as well as state and local law enforcement and foreign governments, poses a very real threat to First Amendment-protected activities. DHS must do more to minimize the threats to privacy and civil liberties posed by this vast new trove of highly sensitive personal data—and Northrop Grumman should look carefully at these and other criticisms when responding to shareholders’ concerns.

DHS’s legacy IDENT fingerprint database, which HART builds off of, contains information on 220-million unique individuals—an enormous increase from 20 years ago when IDENT only contained information on 1.8-million people. Between IDENT and other DHS-managed databases, the agency already manages over 10-billion biographic records and adds 10-15 million more each week.

"Kellyanne Conway on investigating FBI, DOJ leaks: 'What is everyone afraid of?'",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kellyanne-conway-on-investigating-fbi-doj-leaks-what-is-everyone-afraid-of,"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday taunted top-level officials in former President Barack Obama’s FBI and CIA Monday, asking why they'd be nervous about President Trump’s Justice Department investigating leaks they made to media in an attempt to hurt Trump.

“What is everyone afraid of?” Conway quipped during an appearance on ""Fox and Friends."" “What do you have to hide? How did this all start? Bill Barr, the attorney general, made clear that perhaps there is an investigation into at least eight of these leaks.”

The “leaks” Conway are referring to are alleged communications between top Obama-era intelligence officials and members of the press during the 2016 presidential election and first year of Trump’s presidency.

In 2017, Trump famously fired former FBI Director James Comey — today a prominent anti-Trump figure who the president has dismissed as a “liar” and a “leaker.”

The same year, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was forced to resign from the department after it was discovered he leaked information to the press about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

When it comes to possible investigations into spying on Trump in 2016, @KellyannePolls asks: ""What is everyone afraid of?"" pic.twitter.com/fUG0oOfNg2 — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 7, 2019



During a congressional testimony last week, Attorney General William Barr sent Republicans into a frenzy by citing spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Barr’s statement gave fuel to an already red-hot narrative spun by the White House and leading Republicans who have railed against an anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and criminal intelligence agencies.

After Mueller found no collusion between the president and Russia, Trump encouraged his allies on Capitol Hill and Barr to “investigate the investigators.”

“Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction,” Trump tweeted last month. “These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!”

Now that scrutiny has shifted in part to how the Mueller probe began, Conway smirked at the thought of anti-Trump figures shaking in their boots.

“I, for one, as a citizen of this country, want to know if intelligence officers were leaking information to the press,” Conway said. “I think a few of them look a little nervous these days.”"
CA EPA scientist says she was demoted after manager threats,https://www.sacbee.com,[],,,,https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article230148684.html,"Follow this state worker through 3 sexual harassment lawsuits and 9 job moves California state worker Dennis B. Kellogg was named in three sexual harassment lawsuits as he worked for six different departments, including State Parks, Corrections and the DMV. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK California state worker Dennis B. Kellogg was named in three sexual harassment lawsuits as he worked for six different departments, including State Parks, Corrections and the DMV.

A female scientist at the California Environmental Protection Agency says she had to accept a demotion to escape repeated harassment from a male manager who has kept his job.

In a lawsuit filed in Sacramento County Superior Court, scientist Loretta Sylve says former manager John Paine threatened her in a 2017 exchange in which he pounded his fist on a table and told her “I will hurt you” and “your God won’t protect you.”

Sylve in her lawsuit alleges the comments were part of a pattern of harassment that started a year earlier, about two years after she was promoted to senior environmental scientist at the agency following decades of state service.

The lawsuit alleges Paine harassed and discriminated against Sylve, who is African American, based on her race, gender and religion. As a result, she had to take time off on stress leave, has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and has transferred to the EPA’s Department of Toxic Substances Control, an inferior job to the one she had, according to the lawsuit.

“Being promoted into that position was the highlight of her career,” said attorney Zane Hilton, of Bohm Law Group, which is representing Sylve. “And to be forced into this demotion because of the vile conduct of her supervisor is heartbreaking.”

The EPA didn’t respond to requests for comment. Court records indicate the agency has not yet been served with the complaint. Paine didn’t respond to a voicemail or an email.

Starting in 2016, Paine “became aggressive in his tone, undermined Ms. Sylve’s instructions to staff and gave opposite instructions to staff without any reasoning,” according to the suit.

Sylve reported Paine’s behavior to Assistant EPA Secretary Jim Bohon and to an anti-workplace violence coordinator in August 2016. After an investigation, Paine kept up the yelling and demeaning behavior, according to the lawsuit.

On April 6, 2017, Paine made the threatening comments and gestures, according to the suit. Paine referenced Sylve and other women going “over (his) head” to file complaints. He allegedly used profane language in the exchange.

Then, the next day, Paine commented on Sylve’s race as he blocked her from leaving an office, according to the suit.

“When Ms. Sylve tried to leave her office to use the restroom, Paine blocked her doorway and made derogatory statements such as, ‘What are you going to do? Pee yourself? What are you going to do? Poop? How do we know you washed your hands? We can’t tell because it is the same color as your skin,’” he said, according to the suit.

The suit says two other employees approached and tried to calm Paine down. Sylve complained and was sent home that day; Paine was escorted from the building and placed on leave for three months, according to the suit.

Sylve started seeing a psychologist and went on stress leave shortly before Paine was scheduled to return to work in July 2017, according to the suit. She repeatedly requested she be physically moved to avoid Paine at work, but CalEPA didn’t accommodate her request, according to the suit.

Two different doctors diagnosed Sylve with work-related stress and anxiety, and recommended she return to work only under the condition she wouldn’t report directly to Paine.





After months of back-and-forth came an option letter from CalEPA, telling Sylve she could return to work with no accommodations, retire from state service as disabled, resign, or retire. She refused to accept those options.

Eventually she was offered a supervising environmental scientist position with EPA’s Department of Toxic Substances Control. The new position “complied with her accommodations, (but) it is neither as prestigious or fulfilling as her previous position,” the suit states."
US Dept. of Energy Announces Frontier Supercomputer: Cray and AMD to Build 1.5 Exaflop Machine,https://www.anandtech.com,['Ryan Smith'],,,,https://www.anandtech.com/show/14302/us-dept-of-energy-announces-frontier-supercomputer-cray-and-amd-1-5-exaflops,"The history of the computing industry is one of constant progress. Processors get faster, storage gets cheaper, and memory gets denser. We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

US Department of Energy Supercomputers Frontier Aurora Summit CPU Architecture AMD EPYC

(Future Zen) Intel Xeon Scalable IBM POWER9 GPU Architecture Radeon Instinct Intel Xe NVIDIA Volta Performance (RPEAK) 1.5 EFLOPS 1 EFLOPS 200 PFLOPS Power Consumption ~30MW N/A 13MW Nodes 100 Cabinets N/A 3,400 Laboratory Oak Ridge Argonne Oak Ridge Vendor Cray Intel IBM Year 2021 2021 2018

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."
Microsoft and VA team up to help disabled veterans play video games,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com,['Joshua Axelrod'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com/news/transition/2019/05/08/microsoft-and-va-team-up-to-help-disabled-veterans-play-video-games/,"Disabled veteran gamers are in for a treat thanks to a recent partnership between Microsoft and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Xbox adaptive controller was created so veterans with disabilities and others can play “Halo,” “Kingdom Hearts 3” or whatever games they’re into just as everyone else can.

“It’s a very different approach to a game controller from what I think people conceptualize a game controller to be,” said Bryce Johnson, the inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices. “This is not one-size fits all; this is the opposite of that. You can use this thing to adapt to you.”

Rebootcamp Recommendations

While the controller is currently available to buy, Microsoft donated controllers, consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment to 22 VA rehab centers around the country. Veterans can use the controllers for free at facilities in Washington, D.C., Texas, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, New York and California.

The idea for the adaptive controller was born during the 2015 edition of Microsoft’s annual hackathon, according to Johnson. That’s when Johnson and his Microsoft colleagues met Sgt. Josh Price, who had lost his right arm from his elbow down.

Johnson recalled watching Price use a customized Xbox controller created by Ken Jones, founder of the nonprofit Warfighter Engaged, which is dedicated to coming up with innovative ways for the disabled to enjoy gaming.

“It was super important for us to see it because we had to recognize what people were going through to play games and how much they were willing to do,” Johnson said.

After developing their own adaptive controller, Microsoft approached the VA to make sure veterans had access to it at their facilities.

“The options for video-gaming have been relatively limited,” said Dr. Leif Nelson, the VA’s director of national veterans sports programs and special events. “That’s what’s exciting about this: It’s another option for us to open up the world of esports.”

Jones has been working in adaptive gaming since 2012, when he began to use his engineering skills to create custom controllers for specific disabilities upon request. He eventually turned those projects into Warfighter Engaged, and he was delighted to work with Microsoft on their Xbox adaptive controller.

He said that Xbox controllers can be modified to “do just about anything,” which makes adapting them for veterans’ individual needs fairly simple.

“So it’s about as universal as you’re possibly going to get,” Jones said. “It’s basically a dream come true for people who modify controllers and for people who need it.”

Gaming is also a therapeutic tool for veterans, both physically and mentally, Jones said. That’s why making it easier for veterans to play, through innovations like the Xbox adaptive controller, is a big deal.

“There is some physical therapy going on there,” he said. “It’s moving your muscles around. But a lot of it is cognitive therapy decision-making. It’s just a way of relaxing and doing something that you wanted to do before.”

Nelson, who is a doctor of physical therapy, said gaming can also help veterans avoid isolation.

“It’s a community now and a way to socially engage and interact,” Nelson said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do with our veterans.”

That element of gaming was vital for Dave Crouse, a Marine Corps veteran and director of veterans services at video-game nonprofit Stack Up. He said that the military lifestyle while deployed is a lot of “hurry up and wait,” and many of those extra hours are spent playing video games.

Crouse served from 2003 to 2014 and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal. He lost his left hand and left eye during an operation in Cambodia in 2013, so he knows exactly how crucial video games can be for a veteran’s recovery and how useful something like the Xbox adaptive controller can be for that purpose.

”For me, it is the perfect form of escapism,” he said. “It engages me mentally and physically, and it gives me this cool escape, whether it’s just to decompress or to put some distance between me and the challenges I’m facing.”

There are many ways for veterans to deal with the lingering effects of PTSD, from motorcycle-riding to extreme sports. The best method for Crouse has been playing video games, and products like the Xbox adaptive controller give him and many others the means to continue participating in an activity they love."
"Impeach Trump? House Democrats are stuck if they do, stuck if they don’t.",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Amber Phillips', 'Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress', 'May At Am']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/08/impeach-trump-house-democrats-are-stuck-if-they-do-stuck-if-they-dont/,"There’s a valid case to be made that Congress must do something to punish President Trump’s obstruction-y behavior, as outlined in Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia report. If nothing else, the argument goes, a warning must be sent to future presidents that this is not okay.

Republicans’ reflexive allegiance to Trump means it’s on House Democrats to act. And that’s precisely why their leadership is hesitant to start impeachment proceedings.

Their political opponents are casting everything related to investigating Trump as a partisan move, which makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to convince voters that they are trying to fulfill their duty as a coequal branch of government and hold this president accountable. Even if they do have the purest of intentions, a big chunk of the country won’t believe them.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) summed this up Tuesday at Cornell University: “We can’t impeach him for political reasons, and we can’t not impeach him for political reasons. We have to see where the facts take us.”

She said Trump “is goading us to impeach him.” In an interview Wednesday with Washington Post Live, she added that he is “self-impeachable,” a somewhat vague term that, in context with her other remarks, suggests that Pelosi thinks he’s leaving Democrats no choice but to consider action.

“Every single day the president is making a case — he’s becoming self-impeachable, in terms of some of the things he’s doing,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi astutely noted that Trump doesn’t seem to care if he gets impeached. He might even see a political benefit in having Democrats investigate his tax returns, his finances, his involvement in hush-money payments to women and his attempts to stop the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference. The very existence of an investigation is being weaponized. In that climate, how is Congress supposed to get anything done?

[The 6 most potentially damaging congressional investigations into Trump]

Even the sole bipartisan investigation in Congress seems concerned about how the strong political currents will sweep up and muddy its facts.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has found a “mountain” of evidence about how Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and could publicize its findings soon. The committee chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), told The Washington Post’s Karoun Demirjian that the panel’s report will have a lot more detail about Russia’s interference than Mueller shared. Though Burr hinted that the committee’s investigation does not implicate Trump’s campaign, he seemed worried that the delicate bipartisan findings will lose all nuance in the light of day.

“The tough thing is, everything that we’re going to report on already has a narrative,” Burr said.

Congress has always struggled to be taken at face value. It’s difficult for the public to untangle lawmakers’ intentions from their partisanship, because Congress is a political body. And it doesn’t help that the two times a president has been impeached, it has been by the opposite party.

But today’s House Democrats are struggling to navigate a particularly perfect storm of partisanship that makes their constitutionally mandated task of overseeing the executive branch especially difficult.

Trump has remade the Republican Party into an extremely loyal branch of, well, him. The same day that Pelosi made her remarks about impeachment and partisanship, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor that any questions about Trump related to Russia and obstruction of justice should be “case closed,” ignoring the fact that Mueller suggested Congress should examine his findings. McConnell is also dunking his head in the sand about a legal assessment from more than 700 former federal prosecutors, Republican and Democratic, who signed a letter saying that Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice were he not the president.

But in this Republican Party, loyalty to Trump is what helps you keep your job. So House Democrats must go it alone, which only adds to the perception that they are investigating Trump because he’s the opposition.

Then there’s the fact that the nation is a year and a half out from an election. Elections supercharge whatever politicization already exists, and this election is especially high stakes for congressional Democrats. They are trying to keep control of the House, battling Republicans for the Senate and desperately want to win the White House.

That means that even if Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, Trump can play the victim. He has before. Polls show that a majority of Americans could be sympathetic to him: They don’t want Congress to impeach Trump even if most think he lied.

So Democrats are stuck. Not impeaching Trump could forever cast them as the party that had a chance to punish a president who may have broken the law and backed off because they wanted to keep their jobs. But even considering impeaching Trump may cost many of them their jobs, in part because of how hyperpartisan today’s politics are. As Trump gives Congress more reasons to consider his impeachment, this dynamic appears to be weighing heavily on Pelosi."
Here are some of the gifts received by wealthy Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Steve Dorsey', 'Jake Rosen']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/here-are-some-of-the-gifts-received-by-wealthy-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross/,"From a Thai tea cup set (that arrived broken) and chocolate made from camels' milk, to a gold box, coin and trinkets, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has received an eclectic range of gifts, according to a list obtained by CBS News through a public records request.

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

The 81-year-old investor, known as the ""king of bankruptcy"" for his predilection for buying bankrupt companies, has also been lampooned as financially out-of-touch with most Americans, after suggesting in January furloughed federal workers should take out bank loans to pay their bills.

Though Ross has claimed he's a billionaire, Forbes removed him in 2017 from its list of billionaires after it said financial disclosure forms showed he had less than $700 million in assets."

U.S. Department of Labor cites Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen,https://www.ksn.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.ksn.com/news/kansas/us-department-of-labor-cites-spirit-aerosystems-for-exposing-employees-to-carcinogen/1989850964,"WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen hazards. The company faces penalties of $193,218 for two repeated and four serious violations.

OSHA alleges the company failed to implement feasible engineering controls to limit employee exposure to hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and conduct periodic monitoring of employee exposure. OSHA also alleges the company failed to establish protocols to ensure that employees remove contaminated personal protective equipment and clothing before leaving the work area.

OSHA also alleges the company failed to prevent exposure to hexavalent chromium during aircraft painting and allowed the accumulation of hexavalent chromium on surfaces and failed to ensure that employee respirators fit properly.

""Inhaling excessive levels of hexavalent chromium can cause asthma, and damage to the kidneys, liver, and respiratory system,"" said OSHA Wichita Acting Area Office Director Ryan Hodge. ""It is important for employers to take the appropriate steps necessary to prevent excessive exposure.""

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

"FBI, DHS officials deny agencies less focused on homegrown attacks than other threats",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-dhs-officials-deny-agencies-less-focused-on-homegrown-attacks-than-other-threats,"National security officials on Wednesday denied an April report that the Trump administration's dissolution of a Department of Homeland Security advisory group on domestic terrorism threats led the agency to pay less attention to the problem.

Five weeks ago, the Daily Beast reported Homeland Security in late 2018 shuttered a group within its Office of Intelligence and Analysis that had tracked homegrown violent extremists and domestic terrorists. The analysts had shared federal findings with state and local law enforcement.

On Wednesday, Brian Murphy, principal deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the department, took issue with the report.

“I would like to begin by responding directly to recent inaccurate press reporting that DHS has dramatically reduced its efforts on domestic terrorism,"" Murphy told members of the House Homeland Security Committee.

""I can assure the committee and the American public that throughout the careful calculus of balancing resources and adapting to an ever-changing threat landscape, DHS remains acutely focused on the threat from domestic terrorism,” Murphy said.

[Read more: ISIS seeks to inspire domestic terrorism in America — and sometimes succeeds]

Michael C. McGarrity, assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, told lawmakers at the hearing, ""We don't differentiate between a domestic terrorism attack we're trying to stop or an international terrorism attack. It's a terrorism attack we're looking to stop.""

Murphy did not deny the closing of Homeland Security's intelligence and analysis branch, but he defended the disbandment as a move that allowed the FBI to take the lead on domestic terrorism issues rather than Homeland Security.

“DHS decided that it should pivot to reporting on domestic terrorism to better support the National Strategy for Counterterrorism, enable DHS to more effectively coordinate our resources and capabilities, and better serve the needs of states and local communities that rely on the rapid production of information to combat this threat,” Murphy said.

In the past month, three mass shootings have taken place: at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a Poway synagogue in Southern California, and a school outside Denver."

Pompeo abruptly cancels trip to Germany,https://www.cnn.com,"['Devan Cole', 'Nicole Gaouette']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/mike-pompeo-cancels-trip/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Germany, where he was planning to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel ""due to pressing issues,"" the State Department said early Tuesday.

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

Green Mountain College

Vermont's ailing higher education sector has gotten a cash injection from an unlikely source: the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has approved low-interest loans of $94.2 million to five private schools during the past six years.

The money doesn't guarantee a school's survival. Two colleges that received loans are shutting down, and it's unclear whether they'll repay Uncle Sam. The College of St. Joseph in Rutland, set to close this month, borrowed $2.4 million and still owes $1 million. Green Mountain College in Poultney, which will cease to operate shortly after its final commencement May 19, owes $19.5 million. The school's administration put its $20 million campus up as collateral for the loan.

Vermont Law School in South Royalton owes $17.7 million that it borrowed in 2018, the same year it slashed salaries and eliminated tenure for most of its professors in a bid to erase fiscal deficits.

Goddard College in Plainfield borrowed $2.1 million in 2016. The school's financial problems prompted its accreditor to put it on probation last fall.

Bennington College obtained the largest loan approval since 2013, a package worth more than $50 million.

The schools borrowed through the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Programs, which have quietly become a national resource for financially stressed colleges. The USDA has awarded roughly $1.7 billion in the past three years in low-interest loans and grants to help rural schools improve facilities and reconsolidate higher-interest debt.

Paul Costello, executive director of the Vermont Council on Rural Development, said colleges bring multiple benefits to rural areas, and government support such as the USDA loans is important.

""A college brings youth, energy and vitality,"" he said. ""It brings well-educated faculty and staff ... and relatively good paying jobs. It brings street traffic in the downtown. It brings people interested in nightlife and entertainment, so it really lifts the spirits.""

But the loans have critics — especially among conservatives.

""The USDA should not be the lender of last resort, and that's kind of what's happening,"" said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. ""It's not the taxpayers' role to serve as a bailout to small, struggling colleges.""

Green Mountain College's situation shows that ""clearly the USDA did not do a very good job in determining whether or not this was a wise loan in the first place,"" Bakst added.

Green Mountain College announced in January that it would close. The disclosure came only nine months after it received cash from the loan, most of which was immediately used to pay off higher-interest debts. The infusion was meant to pull the school out of a financial tailspin, said Bob Allen, president of the college. Allen arrived at Green Mountain College in 2016 after a long career in business, including 25 years as a senior executive at the Vermont Country Store.

""I really thought I could be instrumental in turning this place around,"" Allen said glumly during an interview in his office on April 29.

At Vermont Law School, a USDA loan has helped right the ship, at least for now. Its president, Tom McHenry, said Vermont's only law school used its federal loan to pay off higher-interest debt to reduce payments. He expects the school to be in the black next year. ""The loan helped us tremendously,"" he told Seven Days. ""We are having no problem making the payments and, given our recent restructuring, we are in a much, much stronger financial situation.""

Bennington College, a small private institution with about 735 students, qualified in 2017 for financing totaling $52.6 million — a $47.6 million direct loan from USDA and a $5 million USDA-guaranteed loan through TD Bank. It, too, sought funds to pay off higher-interest debt; it also wanted to finance renovation of its centerpiece building, the Commons, in a bid to attract more students.

The USDA's agreement with Bennington calls for the feds to hand over the $47.6 million upon completion of the Commons project, scheduled for later this year. In the meantime, the college obtained bridge financing from the Vermont Economic Development Authority, its 2018 audit shows.

Bennington College president Mariko Silver would not comment on the loan or the health of the college. She announced on April 22 that she plans to leave the school in July to become president and CEO of the Henry Luce Foundation.

Jennifer Scott, president of the College of St. Joseph, did not return messages seeking comment, nor did Goddard College president Bernard Bull.

They chose not to answer the question: Should taxpayer money be used to underwrite these loans?

Borrowers do get vetted, first by USDA officials in Vermont, and then by their bosses in Washington, D.C., who make the final call. Vermont's congressional delegation cheers on some applications.

In 2017 for instance, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) signed a letter assuring U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue that Green Mountain College ""is an important educational institution and local employer in our state."" They explained that the loan it sought would consolidate its debts and save on interest.

Leahy deferred a request for comment to his spokesperson David Carle.

Carle noted via email that the loan was for refinancing. The USDA did not add to the school's debt and is attempting to help colleges deal with rising costs and declining student populations, he wrote.

But even with the financial restructuring, Green Mountain College remained in the red. Last month banners on campus still proclaimed that it's one of the top schools for sustainability programs.

""Calling yourself first in sustainability and then shutting down — how ironic,"" said sophomore Chriss Davis, a 21-year-old from Delaware, as she dismounted from a bicycle that pulled a trailer full of recycling and compost buckets, which she distributes for her campus work-study job.

Most of the 427 undergrads at the private college must transfer to new schools.

They'll have fewer choices in Vermont. In addition to Green Mountain College and the College of St. Joseph, Southern Vermont College in Bennington is shuttering. The closings will reduce the tally of Vermont colleges from 21 to 18.

That underscores a trend that imperils the state's higher education sector, which accounts for a sizable portion of the Vermont economy. A 2017 report from the Vermont Higher Education Council said colleges drew $1 billion in tuition annually, employed 11,000 people and boasted a payroll of $588 million. A declining number of high school grads in the Northeast has translated to steadily declining enrollment and deficits at numerous Vermont colleges.

College closures worry local officials, particularly in Poultney, where the impact could be economically ""devastating,"" Costello said. ""People are deeply concerned.""

Green Mountain College employs 150 people and has an annual $6.8 million payroll. The future of its campus — 22 buildings, including the prominent Ames Hall with its white pillared portico, as well 155 acres of land complete with a goat yard, pigpen and chicken coops — is not known.

Would the USDA foreclose on a small private college such as Green Mountain?

Jon Muise, Vermont area director for the USDA Rural Development program, would not comment. He referred questions to acting public information officer Megan Roush. She said the USDA would not speculate on ""hypothetical questions"" about a possible default.

State economic development leaders said temporary federal control of the campus could be a plus. The government would safeguard the interests of the community better than a private lender would, said Ted Brady, deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development. Brady knows the program well: He's a former Leahy staffer who has helped several colleges obtain the loans. He is also a former Vermont director for the USDA Rural Development program.

He recalled rare instances when smaller recipients, from daycare centers to ambulance squads, defaulted.

""The common practice then was that you try to recover as much of the loan and as much of the taxpayers' money as possible while still ensuring you're looking after the best interests of the community,"" Brady said.

Two groups have made overtures about acquiring part or all of the Poultney campus, including alumni who have banded together with a campaign called SaveGMC. But with closure imminent, no offer with viable funding has been made, Allen said. The college paid its first $635,000 installment on the loan and is not in default — thus far.

The USDA is already starting to act like a landlord, albeit a reluctant one.

""They are anxious. They encouraged us to put it on the market, which we've done,"" Allen said, noting that the campus is listed with real estate firm Colliers International.

Allen also said that with the USDA's cooperation, the college has contracted with a trustee to oversee the campus after July 1. Massachusetts accounting firm Verdolino & Lowey will help manage the property, Allen said. ""The concern in town is, as you could imagine, who's going to cut the grass and maintain the buildings while they are unoccupied.""

Students are counting down the final days with a mix of emotions. Davis feels frustrated; she transferred to Poultney five months before the closure announcement. ""No one knew,"" she said. ""I almost feel, like, lied to, in a way.""

Sophomore Shalako Sharp has no regrets about his time at Green Mountain College. ""I wanted to go to the mountains, somewhere beautiful, in nature,"" said the young man from Louisiana.

Grants covered most of his tuition and he found the professors ""amazing,'' including those in his renewable energy and ecological design major.

He's transferring to Prescott College in Arizona, which is one of nine ""teach out"" colleges that have agreed to accept Green Mountain College students. Sharp said he will move west feeling ""so happy that I came here. It's been the best experience of my life."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday defended Trump’s use of executive privilege to withhold U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report from House Democrats, but said it should not prevent Mueller from testifying before lawmakers.

“It is not true the president waived executive privilege by sharing materials with the Special Counsel’s office,” a department official said, adding that a prior attorney general opinion made “clear there is no waiver when the White House cooperates with DOJ (Department of Justice) by providing materials to law enforcement.”"
Justice Department releases redacted Mueller report — again,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-releases-redacted-mueller-report-again,"The Justice Department released a second copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Monday evening, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy and Information Center.

The lightly-redacted version of Mueller's report appears to be identical to the 448-page document that was released in April, except it sheds more light on the redactions by explaining why the blacked-out information is exempted from release under FOIA.

Democrats in Congress are threatening to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for declining to provide them with an unredacted version of the report, and this successful move by BuzzFeed and EPIC may make it easier for their battle for the full report to move forward in federal court.

Along with the report itself, the Justice Department included a letter from senior counsel Vanessa Brinkman addressed to BuzzFeed reporter Jason Leopold, who had filed a FOIA request for the report back on March 21, 2019. Brinkman said the Office of Information Policy had processed the Mueller report under FOIA and had made it available on the Justice Department website. Brinkman also said she had “determined that the Report is appropriate for release with excisions” and listed the different reasons for redactions, including exemptions related to: protecting sources and methods, safeguarding law enforcement techniques, shielding ongoing law enforcement proceedings, keeping grand jury testimony confidential, ensuring deliberative process privilege, avoiding invasions of privacy, and ensuring a fair trial.

One example of how the latest version of Mueller's report adds a bit more clarity to the redaction process can be seen by comparing the short overview section on “Russian Hacking Operations” early in the document. In the originally released version, a few lines in the WikiLeaks section are said to be redacted due to “Harm to Ongoing Matter.” But in the version released Monday, DOJ explains those sentences are blacked out due to exemptions “(b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(C)”, which are related to improper disclosures of information, interference with enforcement proceedings, deprivation of the right to fair trial, and invasion of privacy respectively.

Leopold tweeted earlier in the day: “We intend to challenge all of the redactions.”

Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March and the DOJ released a redacted version of his report in mid-April. The report showed Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr says he determined there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.

Just days before Mueller's report was released the first time, the judge in the FOIA case appeared to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by BuzzFeed, leveling critiques at what he seemed to see as the secrecy being practiced by the Justice Department. ”Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency … I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,"" said Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Taking aim at Barr directly, Walton said, “The Attorney General has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency.” The release of the redacted report is just the beginning of this litigation, and the case will likely continue moving forward in federal court shortly.

The same night the Justice Department released this second version of the Mueller report, the Justice Department was also engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with the Democrat-run House Judiciary Committee over the department's refusal to turn over an unredacted version of the report.

Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement late Monday evening saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Justice has agreed to meet with my staff tomorrow — and not Wednesday afternoon, as originally proposed by DOJ.”

“It remains vital that the Committee obtain access to the full, unredacted report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said. “At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand.”

Earlier in the day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law.”"
