"US tariffs on China jump as deadline passes, China immediately says it will retaliate",https://www.cnbc.com,"['Jacob Pramuk', 'Everett Rosenfeld', 'Vcg', 'Getty Images']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/china-trade-us-tariffs-jump-but-trade-war-talks-to-continue.html,"President Donald Trump raised the stakes in his trade conflict with China as the U.S. increased tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.

China's Commerce Ministry said immediately after the midnight ET deadline for the tariff hike that it would take countermeasures against the American move. It did not announce what its response would entail, but said it ""deeply regrets"" the turn of events.

It had been hoped that a resolution could be reached by the two sides prior to the deadline for the tariff hike, but no deal materialized. Trade talks between the world's two largest economies are set to continue on Friday.

""This evening, (United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer) and (Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin) met with President Trump to discuss the ongoing trade negotiations with China. The Ambassador and Secretary then had a working dinner with Vice Premier Liu He, and agreed to continue discussions tomorrow morning at USTR,"" Judd Deere, White House Deputy Press Secretary, said in a Thursday evening statement.

Yet despite the ongoing talks about a trade agreement, the Trump administration is hiking duties on the products from 10% to 25%.

The move risks widening a trade war that has spooked investors and raised fears about global economic damage. Only a week ago, the White House was boosting hopes that the U.S. and China would resolve their trade dispute this week and potentially have a deal to announce.

Beijing promised ""necessary countermeasures"" this week if the U.S. raised tariffs. China did not specify the actions it would take to retaliate.

Trump first announced the tariff increase Sunday as the White House accused China of reneging on key parts of a developing agreement. On Wednesday night, he claimed Beijing ""broke the deal"" — a remark that sent Asian and U.S. stocks tumbling on Thursday. U.S. equity markets recovered later in the day after Trump said a deal was still possible this week. He added that he received a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping and could speak to his counterpart on the phone.

Still, the engagement between Washington and Beijing this week did not prevent Trump from following through on his threat. Ahead of the tariff increase, the president called duties an ""excellent"" alternative to a trade deal, saying they brought in ""billions"" for the U.S. government. U.S. consumers bear the brunt of the tariff costs, not China, as Trump has argued.

Industries and businesses affected by the tariff hike will not feel the effect right away: it will apply to goods exported after May 10, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It will not affect products already in transit to the United States.

Trump has prepared to put even more pressure on China as he pushes for an agreement. The president has threatened to slap 25% tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese goods that remain untaxed.

The president entered the White House promising to crack down on what he calls Chinese trade abuses and has made a deal a priority ahead of his November 2020 bid for reelection. The White House aims to resolve grievances such as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and trade deficits.

Patience has grown thin in parts of the U.S.: Farmers in key electoral states want Trump to ink a deal.

So far, the U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion total in Chinese products. Beijing has put duties on $110 billion in U.S. goods.

China took a tougher stance in negotiations after getting a sense the U.S. may be willing to compromise, according to The Wall Street Journal. The view came in part from the fact that Trump called for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, which could have signaled that the president thought the economy was in worse shape than he publicly said.

Giuliani Plans Ukraine Trip to Push for Inquiries That Could Help Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Kenneth P. Vogel'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine-trump.html,"But intermediaries for Mr. Giuliani worked to organize meetings with people who they believed would have insights into the incoming Zelensky administration and the investigations in which Mr. Giuliani was interested. And in recent days, Mr. Giuliani reached out through intermediaries to request a meeting with Mr. Zelensky, he said, adding, “It’s not confirmed yet.”

If the meeting does occur, Mr. Giuliani said, “I am going to tell him what I know about the people that are surrounding him, and how important it is to do a full, complete and fair investigation.”

He said his efforts in Ukraine have the full support of Mr. Trump. He declined to say specifically whether he had briefed him on the planned meeting with Mr. Zelensky, but added, “He basically knows what I’m doing, sure, as his lawyer.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

Mr. Trump has called attention to the scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter Biden, and to questions about the former vice president’s involvement in the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office had authority over investigations of the oligarch whose company paid Hunter Biden.

Mr. Trump has also sought to stir up interest in claims that Ukrainian officials tried to benefit Hillary Clinton in 2016 by focusing attention on Mr. Manafort’s business in Ukraine. The attention forced Mr. Manafort to resign from the Trump campaign, but allies of the Ukrainian officials involved have denied that they acted improperly to benefit Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump has recently suggested he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into the material gathered by the Ukrainian prosecutors.

Mr. Giuliani has been working on the effort with other allies of Mr. Trump whose involvement has not been previously reported, including Victoria Toensing, a lawyer who was named last year, along with her husband, as part of the legal team representing the president in the special counsel’s investigation. The appointment was rescinded less than one week later amid concerns about conflicts of interest, but Mr. Trump’s legal team suggested that Ms. Toensing and her husband, Joseph E. diGenova, would assist the president “in other legal matters.”

On social media and in regular appearances on Fox News, the couple advanced the theory that the special counsel’s investigation was the result of a Justice Department effort to frame Mr. Trump. They increasingly began pushing the claim that “the real collusion began in @Ukraine,” as Ms. Toensing put it in a post on Twitter in March."
James Comey: Donald Trump indictment possible after presidency,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Victor Morton']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/9/james-comey-donald-trump-indictment-possible-after/,"Former FBI director James Comey said Thursday that he thinks President Trump likely has committed crimes that could be cause for indictment once he leaves office and, were he not president, likely would already have been indicted.

In a CNN town-hall-style meeting, Mr. Comey was asked by host Anderson Cooper whether Mr. Trump acted with corrupt intent to interfere with an ongoing investigation.

“It sure looks that way,” Mr. Comey replied, saying he based that judgment on his reading of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report and leaning most heavily on Mr. Trump’s order to White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller.

When Mr. Cooper asked the former FBI chief whether he agreed with an open letter from numerous federal prosecutors that Mr. Trump would already have been indicted on obstruction of justice charges if were not the president, Mr. Comey was emphatic.

“Yes. agree. No doubt,” he told Mr. Cooper.

It has been longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Attorney General William Barr has said, though, that Mr. Mueller’s decision not to charge Mr. Trump was not based on that policy alone.

When a president could be indicted poses an awkward question, Mr. Comey said.

He said Mr. Mueller, in writing his report, seemed to be balancing Justice Department policy with building a factual record that could be used in other circumstances, such as Congress’s power to impeach a president.

“I can tell you from personal experience … that can be misinterpreted,” he said, a glancing allusion to his own decisions in the Hillary Clinton emails case.

Contrary to his saying Thursday that corrupt intent could be inferred about Mr. Trump for his actions though, he declined to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton because, he said, such intent could not be proven.

When asked whether Mr. Trump could be indicted in 2021 or 2025 when he is no longer president, Mr. Comey said that was in play.

“The Justice Department will have to take a serious look at that,” he said.

Mr. Comey also dismissed another defense of Mr. Trump — that the president by definition cannot obstruct justice by exercising his legitimate constitutional powers to run the executive branch.

“The president is not above the law.” he said, calling the theory pushed by, among others, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz “crazy and a recipe for lawlessness.”

A Strategy Emerges to Counter House Democrats: Dare Them to Impeach,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Peter Baker', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Michael S. Schmidt']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/trump-democrats-impeachment.html,"The president’s strategy is being directed by Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and senior Justice Department officials. Like Attorney General William P. Barr, Mr. Cipollone has strong views about executive power.

Mr. Trump has been watching Fox News and other coverage of congressional efforts to obtain the parts of Mr. Mueller’s report that were redacted by Mr. Barr, people close to him said. At times, his impulses have contradicted the lawyers’ advice, they said.

He has asked some confidants why they should not just reveal everything in the 448-page Mueller report, the vast majority of which has already been made public. But he has also said he wants everyone to move on so he can concentrate on a presidential agenda, a sentiment he expressed on Twitter throughout last weekend.

As for whether Mr. Mueller should be allowed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, the president reversed himself on Thursday and said that he would leave the decision to Mr. Barr, who has said he does not object to such an appearance. But in private, Mr. Trump has continued to poll-test advisers about whether the Justice Department should instead seek to block Mr. Mueller from appearing.

Legal scholars disagree about the administration’s chances of prevailing in court on its privilege claim and subpoena fights, but the White House sees little downside in waging the battle. Even if Mr. Trump were to lose, the more that the various investigations of the president look like a partisan food fight, the easier it may be to dismiss them as mere politics.

Yet the president risks actually pushing Democrats into doing what they otherwise might not have. After Mr. Mueller wrapped up his investigation by saying that he had not established a conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Russia and could neither accuse nor exonerate him of obstructing justice, House leaders poured water on the prospect of impeachment. While Democrats could impeach him in the House, there is no sign that they could muster 20 Republican senators needed for the two-thirds vote required for conviction in the Senate."
Burr holds firm despite GOP anger over Don Jr. subpoena,https://www.politico.com,"['Burgess Everett', 'Marianne Levine', 'Melanie Zanona', 'Caitlin Oprysko']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/09/burr-trumpjr-1315446,"Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr is fighting intense backlash from his own party for subpoenaing the president's son. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Burr holds firm despite GOP anger over Don Jr. subpoena The Senate Intelligence chairman has no plans to withdraw the subpoena for the president’s son.

Richard Burr faces intense pressure from Republicans to drop his subpoena of President Donald Trump’s eldest son and quickly wrap up the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe.

But despite a day facing attacks from the highest rungs of party leadership, Burr is unmoved, according to colleagues in both parties.

Story Continued Below

The North Carolina Republican declined to address the criticism or the subpoena to reporters, but there is no talk yet of withdrawing the subpoena, according to Republican senators. Burr gave a brief update on the status of his Russia investigation at a Senate GOP lunch on Thursday, attendees said.

Burr, known for his independent streak, appeared happy to ignore the political storm he had fueled.

“I told you I’m not going to chat right now. I’m in the middle of something,” Burr said as he made his way to lunch in the Senate dining room. Afterward, he posed for pictures with his lunch guests, then walked into the Capitol and kept his public silence.

Some of Burr’s GOP colleagues, however, were eager to offer complaints that the Intelligence Committee is still working its probe weeks after special counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released.

“The subpoenas can’t happen without a Republican being for it, and I would hope that Republicans would stand firm and say enough’s enough,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to Donald Trump Jr. “This is a great sort of assault on someone, in the sense that you put yourself in jeopardy anytime you come in and testify.”

“This is one great big politicized, political football,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), another Trump Jr. ally. He described broad GOP “frustration on what’s going on at the moment. It’s time to move on from these investigations.”

Some Intelligence Committee members said the panel would need to address the controversial subpoena, which was issued by Burr and the Democratic vice chairman of the committee, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. The subpoena was sent days ago, but news of it leaked just one day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared the Mueller investigation “case closed.”

“The Mueller report has concluded no collusion, and Barr said no obstruction. What’s the deal? Why is this continuing on? I think there needs to be a better conversation about that,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), an Intelligence Committee member.

He later declared he has “confidence” in Burr but reiterated “we pretty much know just about everything we need to know.” His fellow Texan Ted Cruz agreed, tweeting: “There’s no need for another subpoena.” Others were harsher. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) called Burr's move “beyond inappropriate” and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said it was “bad form” not to give the president a heads-up.

Trump name-checked Burr on Thursday, expressing his disapproval with the subpoena and arguing his son had been “totally exonerated” by Mueller.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/1884/1155968404_6034781810001_6034791067001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

“I was very surprised,” Trump told reporters. “I saw Richard Burr saying there was no collusion two or three weeks ago.”

Indeed, the family element of the subpoena heightened the tension. Trump Jr. has been closely linked to Trump’s style of politics, barnstorming the country last year on behalf of GOP Senate candidates and seen within the Republican Party as a loyal soldier.

So there was little surprise within Capitol Hill that the subpoena became an intraparty flash point.

“Bringing in the son of the president? That’s quite intense, let’s put it that way, to go do that,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.).

And though many Trump-aligned Republicans are criticizing the committee — and in some cases Burr himself — it’s not a unanimous view.

“He’s a good chairman, and I don’t have any problem with his decision,” said Intelligence Committee member Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). “I don’t have any reason to disagree with Sen. Burr’s decision.”

Blunt and Cornyn said there has been no discussion of reversing the subpoena.

“Conservatives shouldn’t criticize Burr. Because Burr was assigned the lead role on all of this Russia collusion stuff by the leader,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). “The leader had confidence in Burr’s leadership, nobody else ought to be questioning it.”

Democrats also backed up Burr, a three-term senator with a conservative voting record, a North Carolina drawl and a laid-back attitude that includes usually wearing no socks and bringing his own lunch to catered party confabs.

“I’m very proud of the fact that we’re the only committee that’s kept bipartisan through this whole investigation,” said Warner. “The chairman’s had pressure to shut this down this down for a long time. I’ve had pressure to reach a conclusion before we’re finished. We’re going to do our job.”

“The case is not closed as far as our committee is concerned,” said Intelligence Committee member Angus King (I-Maine), referring to McConnell’s comments.

McConnell declined to comment for this story. But he did tout the importance of Burr’s investigation on Tuesday even as he dismissed Democrats’ calls to continue litigating the Mueller report and questions of collusion and obstruction.

Yet to many Republicans, the news of Trump Jr.’s subpoena presented a painful dilemma: Stand with a respected GOP chairman who has held together his committee for years during a contentious probe, or with a president who takes vengeance on fellow Republicans who cross him and his family.

“I don’t want to second-guess Richard,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). But he added: “Put yourself in Don Jr.’s place. In this environment would you go to Round 5?”

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is facing a primary challenge in his reelection race next year, tweeted about the subpoena and said it is “time to move on.” But he protested when asked whether he was frustrated with Burr.

“I respect Sen. Burr more than anybody else in the U.S. Senate because I know him better than anybody else, and he’s got a tough job to do and he’s done a good job,” Tillis said. He said his tweet was intended to “quickly head off” Democrats from trying to go on the attack.

Burr has been a complex figure in the long-running investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He’s skipped events with Trump to maintain the appearance of neutrality, yet also was cited in the Mueller report for apparently briefing White House officials on the FBI’s Russia probe. Burr reportedly helped the administration knock down stories about links between the Trump campaign and Russia, yet also maintained unity on his committee while the House Intelligence panel self-destructed amid partisan acrimony.

The North Carolina Republican’s latest move deepens the intrigue and tensions in the GOP over the investigation. But Burr’s allies say it’s all overblown.

“We’re not prosecutors,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “We’re an oversight committee ... and I think it’s important for us to finish this report.”"
Trump to Nominate Patrick Shanahan as Pentagon Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Helene Cooper', 'Thomas Gibbons-Neff']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/patrick-shanahan-defense-department.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will nominate Patrick M. Shanahan as his second defense secretary, trying to cement the acting Pentagon chief against an expected challenging battle with lawmakers and Defense Department officials skeptical of him, White House officials said on Thursday.

The announcement, in a tweet from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, followed a monthlong Pentagon ethics investigation that found that Mr. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, had not acted improperly in official meetings when discussing military contractors.

Announcing the nomination in a Twitter statement from his press secretary, Mr. Trump eschewed the usual pomp and ceremony that comes with putting forth his nominee to lead the country’s 1.2 million active-duty military troops.

Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Trump intended to nominate Mr. Shanahan because of his “outstanding service to the country and his demonstrated ability to lead.” She trumpeted Mr. Shanahan’s dual graduate degrees, in engineering and business administration, from the “Massachusetts Institution of Technology.” (It is actually the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.)"
Judge orders DOJ to produce unredacted parts of Mueller report about Roger Stone,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-mueller-report-judge-amy-berman-jackson,"A federal judge in Washington on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to turn over any unredacted sections of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian activities during the 2016 presidential campaign that relate to longtime Republican political operative Roger Stone.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson gave federal prosecutors until Monday to ""submit unredacted versions of those portions of the report that relate to defendant Stone and/or 'the dissemination of hacked materials.'"" Jackson said she would review the material in private to see if it is relevant to the case and to decide whether Stone and his defense team will have access to the material, likely under strict supervision.

Stone asked Jackson last month to order Justice to turn over a full copy of the Mueller report to his defense as part of discovery. Federal prosecutors opposed the request, saying the government had no obligation to provide the information Stone sought and claiming they had already given Stone significant information, including grand jury testimony and material that may be favorable to his defense.

EX-ROGER STONE ASSOCIATE PLANS TO ASK SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF MUELLER'S APPOINTMENT

The 66-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges he lied to Congress, engaged in witness tampering and obstructed a congressional investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The charges stem from conversations stone had during the campaign about WikiLeaks, which published emails stolen from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee in the summer of 2016.

Stone's lawyers claim there are constitutional issues with the Mueller investigation, and have filed motions arguing he was selectively prosecuted, challenging the constitutionality of Mueller's appointment and insisting that the special counsel didn't have the ability to prosecute him for lying to Congress. They allege that Congress did not formally make a referral to the Justice Department about Stone's testimony, and that Mueller's investigation was ""a violation of the separation of powers.""

Stone is scheduled to go to trial in November.

Trump to nominate Shanahan as defense secretary,https://www.cnn.com,"['Eli Watkins', 'Kaitlan Collins', 'Ryan Browne', 'Zachary Cohen']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/09/politics/trump-nominate-shanahan/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump intends to nominate acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to be his permanent pick to replace James Mattis at the Pentagon, according to a tweet from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

""Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,"" Sanders said in a statement.

Shortly after the announcement, Shanahan issued a statement saying he was ""honored"" to be chosen as the Pentagon's permanent head. The former Boeing executive said in comments to reporters after the announcement that he had been informed of the decision earlier Thursday.

""If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,"" Shanahan said in a statement. ""I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.""

Shanahan took over the job in an acting role following the December resignation of Mattis, who left the administration over a series of policy differences with Trump, particularly over the President's initial decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.

While Mattis had intended to stay on until the end of February in part to allow time for his successor to be named and confirmed, Trump, reportedly angry over the coverage of the' resignation, decided to cut the transition period short, thrusting Shanahan into the role on January 1.

Shanahan cleared a major hurdle blocking him from becoming Trump's nominee last month when the Department of Defense's inspector general cleared him of allegations he violated ethics agreements by promoting the interests of his former employer, Boeing.

The White House and Pentagon had both indicated Shanahan could not be nominated until the IG investigation concluded. One White House official pointed to the IG report clearing Shanahan as the main hurdle that he had needed to clear to be tapped for the job. The official conceded that West Wing aides had anticipated that Shanahan would be nominated sooner than Thursday, as the report came out weeks ago.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, perhaps previewing criticism Shanahan can expect to face in the confirmation process, said the permanent role would be a ""very different job than his previous position.""

""Serving as secretary of defense is an immense task and I look forward to hearing directly from the acting secretary during the confirmation process,"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who's the committee chairman, issued a statement saying he was pleased with the nomination.

""We need a confirmed leader at the department and, after working with him closely over the last few months, I welcome his selection,"" Inhofe said.

The announcement on Thursday came as the Trump administration faces foreign policy challenges on multiple fronts. On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would reduce commitments to the joint nuclear agreement -- a year after Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the deal the Obama administration championed. The Trump administration has supported the efforts of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in a standoff with the nation's president, Nicolas Maduro, and just hours before the announcement, South Korea said North Korea had launched two suspected ""short-range missiles.""

In a nod to the global flashpoints, Shanahan said the biggest challenge he would face was ""balancing it all.""

""As you can tell, there are real world events that happen every day, so you have to spin a lot of plates,"" Shanahan said at the Pentagon.

White House debate

CNN previously reported that Trump had told aides that he has been impressed by Shanahan's tenure as acting secretary and was inclined to nominate him to formally take over the permanent role, one source close to the White House told CNN in late February. When some of his advisers suggested other candidates, Trump responded by saying he is inclined to keep Shanahan.

A source close to the White House had said previously that Trump leaned toward nominating Shanahan to the post because he believed he would not push any particular policy agenda on the President -- a major source of tension between Trump and Mattis.

And while Mattis was largely seen as having the stature to push back against some of Trump's nontraditional policies and ideas, Shanahan is seen as much less likely to do so.

""This is the department of get stuff done,"" Shanahan has reportedly said on multiple occasions.

However, Thursday's announcement was the result of lobbying by White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as well.

In March, some West Wing officials were no longer convinced Shanahan would get the defense secretary job. Shanahan and other administration officials, including Mulvaney, repeatedly pressed Trump to nominate him, with Shanahan arguing that he could not act at his fullest capacity if he was just acting secretary.

But this pressure campaign annoyed Trump, sources said, and led him to begin quizzing people about who should become the permanent secretary.

""Fine, tell me who to nominate,"" Trump told one ally at the time.

Once they realized he was not set on Shanahan, outside forces began pitching names to Trump, like Army Secretary Mark Esper and former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, though people close to Trump doubted he would ever get on board with Wilson because she was dismissive of Space Force.

But Mulvaney succeeded in his efforts to get Shanahan nominated. He developed a liking for the former Boeing executive early on and advised the President he needed someone who was not a general."
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

Rosenstein’s Farewell Turns Into a Trump-Russia Reunion,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Betsy Woodruff'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/deputy-attorney-general-rod-rosensteins-farewell-turns-into-a-trump-russia-reunion,"On Thursday, hundreds of high-powered defense lawyers and Justice Department employees packed into the DOJ’s cavernous Great Hall, which is reserved only for the most auspicious occasions. It was standing room only, and an overflow crowd gathered on the balcony overlooking the main floor.

A host of minor legal celebrities—from embattled ex-White House Counsel Don McGahn to Mueller probe alum Michael Dreeben—had all assembled to send off Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. His last day at the Justice Department is Saturday, and his send-off, much like his DOJ tenure, was much more dramatic than most deputy attorney generals’. And it brought together a mix of eclectic officials that reflected his colored—and controversial—time as the DOJ’s main manager: White House aide and loyalist Kellyanne Conway was there; so was Sen. Richard Burr, who just subpoenaed the president’s son.

They all assembled under the hall’s famous, imposing art-deco statues of the spirits of Justice. One statue has a bare breast, and former Attorney General John Ashcroft hid the statue behind a curtain during his time there (he said it was to make a better backdrop for TV cameras). For Rosenstein’s send-off, Mr. and Mrs. Justice stood uncovered, in all their aluminum glory.

Attorney General Bill Barr took the occasion to joke a bit about the House Judiciary Committee’s recent move toward holding him in contempt of Congress.

“Now, in those days, the deputy job was a lot different,” Barr said, referring to the year 1990, when Rosenstein started working at the Department. “But I’ll tell you now, the attorney general job is a lot different.”

“You like records,” he continued. “This must be a record for attorney general being proposed for contempt within a hundred days of taking office.”

There were a few chuckles.

Barr’s contempt troubles are the latest episode of the saga of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rosenstein gave Mueller the job and outlasted criticism from congressional Republicans, Fox News hosts, and the president himself to see it through. But the end of the probe, which didn't find evidence that any Americans helped the Kremlin spread propaganda and hack Donald Trump’s political foes, isn't the end of the story. With Rosenstein’s apparent approval, Barr chose to decide for himself whether Trump committed a crime while trying to impede the investigation. Barr also opted to withhold redacted portions of Mueller’s final report from Congress. House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler subpoenaed the full report, Barr defied the subpoena, and now Nadler’s committee has moved to hold him in contempt.

So Rosenstein leaves the department in the midst of a congressional brawl. The speakers at his send-off ceremony found humor in the fact that he led the department into, through, but not out of a state of war.

Barr’s wasn’t the afternoon’s only laugh-ish line. Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert Hur, previously Rosenstein’s deputy, alluded to tense times in their office when he gave the event’s opening remarks.

“And because our work is so serious, thank goodness that we, and the DAG [deputy attorney general], had a very good sense of humor,” Hur said. “You’re going through tough times when you say, ‘Can’t make this sh-tuff up.’ You can either laugh or you can cry. And I remember a lot of laughter every day, and I certainly don’t remember any crying.”

The crowd cheered.

“To borrow a phrase from Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own, there’s no crying in the ODAG [Office of the Deputy Attorney General].”

Later in the program, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke, addressing a roomful of lawyers and politicos who had watched with eyes peeled as Trump turned his time there into a soap opera, spending more than a year trying to humiliate him into un-recusing from the Russia probe. Sessions, like Hur, made jokes.

“When we came in, I had no doubt there would be a lot of controversies during my tenure,” he said.

“But in truth, I have to say, our run exceeded my expectations,” he added. “So when I recused, using the recent words of Attorney General Barr, the baby fell to Rod. The so-called collusion investigation became his and it was no little matter. There was a continual uproar. Decisions had to be made, and those decisions fell to him.”

Sessions praised Rosenstein’s decisions.

“He stayed the course during some of the most difficult times in the history of the department,” he said. “Though the investigation was ongoing when he arrived, he didn’t start it. And once started, to my observation over the years, these things just become unstoppable. They have to work their will.”

“Rod, you did your duty as it fell upon you,” he continued. “You didn’t ask for it, that’s for sure. You initiated the process, you followed the regulations. The system worked its will. What more can a public servant do?”

Sessions then reminisced about his tumultuous run as attorney general.

“We had many wonderful times, but things were often a bit not normal,” he continued. “I remember a dinner at a nearby restaurant, [Solicitor General] Noel Francisco and Rod and I, one night. The paparazzi caught us and even that dinner could mean some sort of message, it seemed.”

When Rosenstein spoke, he praised both attorney generals he served under.

“We stayed the course, and we accomplished what we set out to do,” he said. “There are many people in this room who stood with me to defend the ramparts of justice. When we are in the right, we keep moving forward. Our confidence is not naïve. It flows from an appreciation of the history and the traditions of this great institution.”

He also made comments that sounded like a vague reference to former FBI Director James Comey, whose public statements on the Hillary Clinton email investigation he famously criticized.

“Government officials sometimes face pressures to compromise principles, perhaps even to trade virtue for the appearance of virtue,” he said. “But we should exercise caution whenever unpleasant circumstances tempt us to disregard timeless principles. It is most important to follow the rules when the stakes are highest. Sticking with traditions is usually the best course—not always, but usually. After all, that is why they became traditions.”

Comey has spent his time in the public eye being remarkably candid about his views on ethics, philosophy, and thorny moral questions. But Rosenstein seemed to intimate in that comment that Comey overcomplicated things—using a lofty philosophical approach to wrestle with hard questions when simply consulting the rule-book would have sufficed.

Comey drew Rosenstein’s opprobrium for making detailed public comments on Clinton’s handling of a private email server a few months before the 2016 presidential election. Those comments—a jarring break from the Justice Department policy barring the release of damaging information about people who aren’t charged with crimes—hurt the Clinton campaign and boosted Trump.

A few months after being sworn in as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein wrote a memo detailing his criticism of Comey’s behavior. Shortly after receiving it, Trump fired Comey, who was then supervising the investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference. White House aides pointed to Rosenstein’s memo to justify the firing, but Rosenstein later told Congress he hadn’t meant them to use it that way.

After Trump fired Comey, Rosenstein appointed Mueller to oversee the investigation–enraging the president and accelerating a probe that dominated his first year and a half in office.

But Rosenstein never balked on the substance of his memo on Comey. And his goodbye ceremony came on a date he likely remembered: the two-year anniversary of that firing."
Opinion | The Next President Should Not Be a Man,https://www.nytimes.com,['Farhad Manjoo'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/opinion/woman-president.html,"Meanwhile, every man who’s running will somehow have to come up with a credible answer to this simple question: After everything we’ve just learned about how gender bias has systematically decimated female leadership in America, can you give us one good reason for the next president to be yet another man?

I’ve spent a lot of time chatting with people in and out of politics about this question, and I really haven’t heard a good answer to it. And so I’ve come to harbor the opposite bias. It would be a terrible mistake for the Democrats to nominate a man as their standard-bearer against Trump, and it would be tragic for the United States to elect a man to the presidency in 2020 — not just Trump but any man, whether Biden or Beto or Buttigieg or Bernie.

This isn’t because all the men who are running are terrible. It’s because, in key ways, a man, even your favorite man, would be a lesser advocate than many of the women for some of the most important social and political issues of the day. A male candidate’s very maleness would damage a central pillar of the best political arguments against Trump. And if he wins, his gender’s enduring blindness to issues involving women in society might stunt urgent and necessary political action.

Let’s start with the political calculus. Though the 2016 race was besotted with gender bias, it’s a mistake to conclude that Americans will not vote for a woman over Donald Trump, because what happened in 2016 was that a majority of Americans voted for a woman over Donald Trump.

And in the past few years, the political climate for female candidates has only grown more favorable. In the spiraling revelations of #MeToo, much of the nation (especially men) suddenly saw the damaging pervasiveness of misogyny in every part of society.

Today, gender politics are at the core of all politics. There is a huge gender gap — most voters in 2018 were women, and about 60 percent of them voted for Democrats — and much of the money, organization and energy on the left has been driven by a broad, reawakened feminism. And not just on the left: According to Gallup, the “way women are treated in U.S. society” was among the most important issues to voters in 2018, above gun policy, taxes, wealth inequality and Russian involvement in American politics.

This reawakened feminism should turn reflexive bias on its head. The women who are running this year are broadly qualified to occupy the White House. They’ve won statewide races, they’ve survived brutal primaries, they’ve advanced novel and pathbreaking public policy ideas. I can’t see many of the male candidates making a strong case that he would be a more effective advocate for the feminist energy now fueling the left than any of these talented women."
Suicides on VA properties sound the alarm on veteran care,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Dean Reynolds'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-military-veteran-suicides-on-veterans-affairs-properties-sound-the-alarm-on-veteran-care/,"Veterans can talk with a trained counselor through the Veterans Crisis Line.

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
Judge demands unredacted Mueller report in Roger Stone case,https://www.politico.com,"['Darren Samuelsohn', 'Heather Caygle', 'Kyle Cheney']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/09/roger-stone-mueller-1313624,"The judge in Roger Stone's case wants to review blacked-out sections of the Mueller report as she weighs a bid by Stone's lawyers to dismiss the case. | Win McNamee/Getty Images legal Judge demands unredacted Mueller report in Roger Stone case

Federal prosecutors handling Roger Stone’s case were ordered on Thursday to turn over to a judge any unredacted sections of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report relating to the longtime GOP operative that could help prepare his defense for their upcoming trial.

U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson in a one-paragraph order gave the U.S. attorneys handling the Stone case until Monday to provide her with portions of Mueller’s report that deal with Stone “and/or ‘the dissemination of hacked materials’” that were leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign to the detriment of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Story Continued Below

Jackson said she wants to review in private those blacked-out sections of the Mueller report as she weighs several motions from Stone’s lawyers requesting access as part of a larger bid to dismiss the case. Mueller charged Stone in January with lying to Congress and obstructing the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, with a trial in Washington scheduled to begin Nov. 5.

Stone’s lawyers last month asked for the entire Mueller report as they pressed Jackson to toss out the case before trial. His attorneys are also trying to get the case transferred from Jackson, who presided over the guilty plea and sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, as well as several other Mueller-related matters.

But federal prosecutors who took over the Stone case last month upon the conclusion of the Mueller probe filed an opposition motion Friday arguing against turning over the special counsel’s unredacted report to the defense.

“The government is complying with its discovery obligations in this case, including its obligation to provide the defense with disclosable material that could be construed as exculpatory as well as information regarding the credibility of witnesses that the government intends to call at trial,” the lawyers from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia wrote. “Because disclosable information that may have been redacted from the public version of the Special Counsel’s report to the Attorney General is already being provided to the defendant in discovery, the defendant is not entitled to an unredacted copy of the report.”

Stone’s attempt to see the redacted Mueller report is one of a handful of legal bids working their way through the courts dealing with the special counsel’s work. The Electronic Privacy Information Center and BuzzFeed are suing the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act for the entire unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence. House Judiciary Committee Democrats also voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress as they try to enforce a subpoena for access to the blacked-out portions of Mueller’s 448-page report, a precursor to their own upcoming court fight for the documents.

"Lindsey Graham on board with Shanahan nomination, despite dispute over Syria policy",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-on-board-with-shanahan-nomination-despite-dispute-over-syria-policy,"Sen. Lindsey Graham is on board with Patrick Shanahan becoming the next secretary of defense although the two were at odds with one another in February over troop presence in Syria.

“I believe Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan is a logical choice to become the next Secretary of Defense,” the South Carolina Republican, a leading voice on military matters, said in a statement Thursday. “He has demonstrated to me his detailed understanding that a strong, modern, and well-trained military is essential in a dangerous and complex world.”

“I hope and expect that he will advocate for defense policies that lead from the front, not from behind,” Graham said. “I also hope and expect he will make it clear to America’s adversaries that we mean what we say, and that our allies see us as a reliable partner.”

The White House announced Thursday that Trump intends to nominate Shanahan, who has been serving as acting secretary of defense for months, to serve as secretary of defense.

Last month, Shanahan was cleared of allegations that he used his position to favor his former employer, Boeing, following an investigation from the Pentagon’s inspector general.

The men reportedly participated in a tense exchange in February after Graham pressed Shanahan on the Trump administration’s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria by the end of April. Graham claimed he told Shanahan the proposal was the “dumbest ... idea I’ve ever heard,” the Washington Post reported.

“Well, if the policy is going to be that we are leaving by April 30, I am now your adversary, not your friend,” Graham claimed he told Shanahan. Other lawmakers present confirmed that Graham had made the comment.

According to NBC News, Shanahan then asked Graham if he had any outstanding questions “as an adversary.”

""It got pretty tense,"" one official who witnessed the exchange told NBC News.

“It was heated, particularly on Graham’s side,” another person familiar with the exchange said.

However, another defense official said that the conversation ultimately ended on a “positive note.”

Shanahan has served as acting secretary of defense since James Mattis resigned in December. His decision to step down was made in part due to the Trump administration’s plan to withdraw all 2,000 troops from Syria.

Despite President Trump’s original orders, the White House announced in February that approximately 200 troops would remain in Syria."

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
Justice Department Charges Daniel Everette Hale With Leaking Secrets to Media,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Olivia Messer'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/justice-department-charges-daniel-everette-hale-with-leaking-secrets-to-media,"A former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency has been charged with leaking classified information to the press about the Obama administration’s use of armed drones, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. It’s the latest in a series of prosecutions by the Trump administration aimed at sources of the press.

Daniel Everette Hale, 31, was charged under the Espionage Act of illegally disclosing top-secret and secret documents to a news organization, according to an indictment filed in March and unsealed Thursday. He was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday morning.

Details from the indictment suggest the organization is The Intercept, which did not respond to a request for comment. It is the third time the Justice Department has prosecuted an alleged Intercept source in the past two years.

Hale served in the Air Force from July 2009 to July 2013, during which time he was assigned to the National Security Agency, according to the indictment. He was deployed to Afghanistan, where he worked as an intelligence analyst. While still at the NSA, in April 2013, Hale allegedly began communicating with an unnamed reporter.

The two met on multiple occasions and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to the indictment. Hale allegedly texted a friend in May 2013, claiming that “[the reporter] wants me to tell my story about working with drones at the opening screening of his documentary about the war and the use of drones.”

Hale left the Air Force in July 2013 and was hired by a defense contractor, where he was assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. From February to August 2014, Hale allegedly printed a total of 36 documents and provided at least 17 to the reporter, some of which were unclassified, according to the indictment. Eleven were secret or top secret documents.

The documents contained a PowerPoint presentation on counterterrorism operations, described a military campaign targeting Al-Qaeda, included information gathered by the NSA on specific named targets, and outlined U.S. military technical capabilities. The documents were later compiled and published by the news website and in a book authored by the reporter, according to the indictment.

Hale was charged with theft of government property and several other counts under the Espionage Act.

Hale’s arrest comes amid a crackdown on leakers to journalists by the Trump administration. Last month, the U.S. charged WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange with allegedly helping veteran intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack a computer password to steal classified documents. In October, a Treasury Department employee was charged with sharing financial information on targets of the Mueller investigation with BuzzFeed.

Last year, two purported Intercept sources were also prosecuted. Former NSA contractor Reality Winner was sentenced to 63 months in prison for leaking classified information about Russian election interference to The Intercept. In October, former FBI agent Terry Albury was sentenced to four years in prison after he pleaded guilty to making an unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, apparently related to how the FBI recruits informants."

Is Trump Suddenly Becoming More Popular?,http://nymag.com,['Ed Kilgore'],05-09-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/is-trump-suddenly-becoming-more-popular-too-soon-to-tell.html,"A popular Donald J. Trump would be largely unprecedented. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

This morning as on every weekday morning I glanced at RealClearPolitics’ polling average for the president’s job-approval ratings, and I nearly dropped my coffee cup: It was at 45.1 percent. Just yesterday I had written that Trump had “yet to hit 45 percent in average approval ratings at either RealClearPolitics or FiveThirtyEight since the earliest days of his presidency.” Scanning RCP’s graph of past averages, I learned that today’s was Trump’s highest average approval rating since February 20, 2017.

So is the president undergoing some sort of serious improvement in his famously stagnant levels of popularity, which could result in him reaching levels consistent with past presidents who were reelected? Are the economy and the triumphant GOP spin on the Mueller report combining to give him an unprecedented lift?

Maybe, but if you take a look under the hood of these polls, you can see that it’s really too early to tell. RCP does a straight-line average of unadjusted recent poll findings within a very limited window. It’s possible this latest spike was mostly attributable to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll giving Trump a 39 percent job-approval rating drifting beyond the window. And RCP’s Trump job-approval averages generally run a bit high because of the frequency with which Rasmussen and Harris X polls of this question — which both have notable and long-standing pro-GOP “house effects” — are released.

By comparison, FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages place Trump at 42.5 percent, which is pretty good for him, but no higher than it was at various points in February of this year, and October and November of last year. FiveThirtyEight, however, has a much wider window of polls that go into its averages, includes more polls, and most crucially, adjusts results for partisan “house effects” and poll and pollster quality.

Interestingly, the two averages are much closer in terms of Trump’s disapproval rating, which also matters: RCP pegs it at 52.3 percent, and FiveThirtyEight at 52.6 percent.

But whichever snapshot of Trump’s popularity you prefer, the bigger question is this: What level should Trump’s approval rating reach before it’s sensible to rate him a solid favorite for reelection, as most incumbents have been? His current approval ratings are often compared to those of eventual winners Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama. But note this:

Reagan’s Gallup approval rating rose from 45 percent 18 months out to 53 percent six months later, then 55 percent eight months later. Obama’s rose from 44 percent 18 months out to 52 percent on Election Eve.

So get back to me the first time Trump’s approval rating tops 50 percent. And for that matter, let’s see if it stays as high as it is now for a sustained period of time. The man does have a knack for stepping on his own good fortune."
"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
James Comey on DOJ inspector general's Trump-Russia investigation: 'Let’s hear it',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-on-doj-inspector-generals-trump-russia-probe-lets-hear-it,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department’s Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but “if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it.""

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, exactly two years after he was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, Comey said no matter what is found by Horowitz's probe or by the investigation being conducted by Attorney General William Barr, “they should be transparent about it.”

Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper told Comey that “the inspector general, the attorney general, they're now obviously looking into the origins of the investigation into the president and his campaign.” He asked Comey: “Are you confident you did everything by the book, and that the FBI, the people around you did everything by the book?”

Comey said he was confident that he, and the FBI more broadly, had done nothing wrong, replying, “Yes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn't mean I'm against review of it. That's totally fine.”

Cooper then pressed him further, asking, “So you think the inspector general will find nothing inappropriate?”

Comey said, “I don't think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.”

The Justice Department inspector general is looking into alleged FISA abuse related to surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The watchdog is also investigating the FBI’s reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier. That research was compiled at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier was a key part of FISA applications and renewals; Comey signed off on three of them.

Cooper told Comey that “CNN has spoken to people within the FBI that say they have concerns that the inspector general could find something, and that they are bracing for what may be uncovered.”

Comey emphasized he looked forward to the results of the investigation and stressed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by himself or by the FBI. “Again, I'm a big believer in the truth. If the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it. I don't know of anything like that,"" he said.

Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during 2016 was criticized in a voluminous report released by Horowitz in June 2018, which Cooper reminded Comey of by saying that the Justice Department inspector general “called your decision not to inform the bosses about the Clinton press conference, they called it extraordinary, insubordinate.” Cooper further reminded him that “they also said your letter to Congress about reopening the Clinton emails investigation to the emails was based on your personal views even if it meant rejecting long-standing department policy or practice.”

Comey replied, “Yeah, that's fair criticism.”

Cooper then asked, “Is it true? Extraordinary and insubordinate and that it rejected long-standing policy practices?”

“Yes, except for the insubordinate part,” Comey contended.

Barr has said Horowitz’s Trump-Russia investigation into the actions of the Justice Department and FBI should be completed in either May or June."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"

“As you have recognized, the Committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” the letter read.

Mnuchin told the Massachusetts Democrat he'd relied on the advice of the Justice Department. He concluded that the department was “not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.”

“The Department of Justice has informed us that it intends to memorialize its advice in a published legal opinion as soon as practicable. Out of respect for the deadlines previously set by the Committee, and consistent with our commitment to a prompt response, I am informing you now that the Department may not lawfully fulfill the Committee’s request,” the letter read.

The move, which was expected, is sure to set in motion a legal battle over Trump’s tax returns. The likely options available to Democrats would be to subpoena the Internal Revenue Service for the returns or to file a lawsuit.

Neal originally demanded access to Trump’s tax returns in early April under a law that said the IRS “shall furnish” the returns of any taxpayer to a handful of top lawmakers, including the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

The White House and the president’s attorneys declined to comment on the deadline to turn over Trump’s returns. Trump already has signaled he has no intention of turning over the much-coveted records.

Trump's third annual budget request recommended dramatically reducing funds to nondefense discretionary spending, calling for the elimination of entire agencies and eliminating popular programs. Each year, Congress has resoundingly rejected the request, raising spending caps and adding to overall nondefense spending.

The proposed 2020 spending bill, which will be marked up in subcommittee on Friday, would increase the budget for the State Department and related agencies by $885.8 million as compared to current levels, add $174.2 million for United States Agency for International Development operations, and add $481.6 million for multilateral assistance through international organizations and banks.

The bill would also shift the $2.2 billion Economic Support Fund from the category of bilateral economic assistance to the category of security assistance.

The bill also includes $6.3 billion for fighting HIV/AIDS around the world, $3.3 billion in security aid to Israel, a $425 million increase for the Peace Corps, and funding for a new International Development Finance Corporation, which was created in a 2018 law.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

"Top US general: Pentagon, DHS working on 'multiyear plan' for border",https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442758-top-us-general-pentagon-dhs-working-on-multi-year-plan-for-border,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said that the Pentagon is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a “multiyear plan"" for the border, suggesting that active duty and National Guard troops will be deployed to the southern border for the remainder of President’s Trump's first term.

“What we’re hopeful to do is to have, in fairly short order, for the secretary of Homeland Security, a much more predictable, comprehensive plan for the next couple years,” Gen. Joseph Dunford said during a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing.

The Defense Department has provided a two-star general “plus a number of planners” to DHS “to “lay out the next couple of years.”

Dunford said the so-called interagency planning team will prepare around the number of migrants expected to come to the southern U.S. border, the capacity of DHS to handle the migrants and the expected support DHS will need from the rest of the government.

“Although the commitment to the border hasn’t impacted our preparedness for other missions at this point, what we wanted to do is get into a more predictable mode of the requirements that the Department of Homeland Security has and do better at integrating across the government,” Dunford said.

There are now about 4,364 U.S. service member at the border, a mix of active-duty and National Guard members, according to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who testified alongside Dunford.

About 1,167 of the service members are performing the primary role of monitoring and detection, but a broader set of missions range from logistical support to aviation support to food service.

The administration has said troops will stay at such posts until DHS “no longer requires [Department of Defense] support to secure the southern border.”

As of last month, the deployment is expected to cost at least $534 million by the end of the fiscal year in September.

Late last month, Shanahan approved a DHS request to send about 320 more military personnel to help with handling migrants entering the United States, easing restrictions on troops interacting with migrants.

In addition, the Army Corps of Engineer is currently on contract to build about 256 miles of barrier.

“How you will see this materialize in the next six months is about 63 new miles of wall will come online, so about half a mile a day will be produced,” Shanahan said."
Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has postponed his visit to Greenland because he needs to return to Washington, the State Department said on Thursday.

“Secretary Pompeo must postpone his visit to Greenland due to a need for the secretary to be in Washington, D.C., today,” spokeswoman Mortgan Ortagus said.

Pompeo had been due to visit Greenland on Thursday, but left London bound for Washington instead.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting revenue from its exports of industrial metals, the latest salvo in tensions between Washington and Tehran over a 2015 international accord curbing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.

Pompeo told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world’s second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union."

(Evan Vucci/AP)

President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was ""very surprised"" that the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena for his eldest son to answer questions about his testimony as part of the Russia investigation.

Speaking to reporters after a White House speech about stopping surprise medical bills, the president argued that Donald Trump Jr. has already testified to congressional committees for close to 20 hours.

""I was very surprised. My son is very good person. Works very hard. The last thing he needs is Washington, D.C.,"" Trump said Thursday. ""He was totally exonerated by Mueller, who frankly does not like Donald Trump.""

When asked if his son planned to fight the subpoena, Trump demurred and said, ""we'll see what happens.""

The first apparent congressional subpoena of Trump's immediate family has frustrated Republicans, who are calling on Democrats to move on from the Russia investigation. The younger Trump testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 about proposed plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow. He said he was ""peripherally aware"" of the project, but the president's former personal attorney Michael Cohen testified earlier this year that the president's eldest son had more involvement.

At a weekly press conference earlier on Thursday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said it's time for Democrats to move on from Mueller's investigation and report. He called on the committee, led by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, to rethink the subpoena."
Can USDA’s May Reports Overtake the Market Headlines?,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/can-usdas-may-reports-overtake-the-market-headlines/,"An array of factors has been tugging the grain markets this month.

First, planting is significantly behind schedule—especially for corn. As of May 5, 23% of the U.S. corn crop is planted, which compares to a five-year average of 46% planted by this date. Each of the major corn-growing states are behind. Illinois corn farmers are 56 percentage points behind the average pace, at only 10% planted. Farmers in Indiana are 30 percentage points behind average and farmers in Ohio are 25 percentage points behind. Farmers in South Dakota haven’t made any progress in planting.

In soybeans, only 6% of the nation’s crop is planted, which compares to a five-year average of 14% by this date. Farmers in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina and Tennessee are close to average progress or slightly ahead.

While planting is behind, the headline grabber this week was when President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods may be raised from 10% to 25% on Friday, as trade talks between the U.S. and China progress were going ""too slowly."" Markets around the world crashed following the tweet.

Now, we’re on the eve of what is traditionally another big market mover: USDA’s May edition of the Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports.

“Typically, the May WASDE report is one of the biggest USDA reports of the year,” says Ted Seifried, chief market strategist and vice president with Zaner Ag Hedge Group. “This report essentially sets the baseline from which the USDA will be working from for the rest of the new marketing year.”

Granted, the balance sheet almost always looks different by the end of the year, Seifried notes. But the report provides a starting point and clues as to what changes USDA will make in the future.

The pre-report trade estimates for crop production include:

Corn: 14.841 billion bu., with an average yield of 175.3 bu./acre

Soybean: 4.1985 billion bu., with an average yield of 49.8 bu./acre

Wheat: 1.910 billion bu., of which 1.277 billion bu. will be winter wheat

Will the Bulls or Bears Rule?

“Traders are looking for bearish news,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “We should see reduced old-crop demand estimates for corn and soybeans and larger carryout estimates, as a result.”

The general attitude, Vaclavik says, is that the burdensome supply situation for corn, soybeans and wheat will continue through the 2019-20 marketing year.

“If you look at some of the pre-report carryout estimates for 2019-20, they're very similar or higher to those big posted for 2018-19,” he says. “This of course assumes a fairly normal production situation in terms of yield.”

The pre-report trade estimates for ending stocks include:

Corn: 2.058 billion bu. (2018/19) and 2.132 billion bu. (2019/20)

Soybeans: 923 million bu. (2018/19) and 925 million (2019/20)

Wheat: 1.096 billion bu. (2018/19) and 1.060 billion bu. (2019/2020)

“The trade should take the 2019-20 numbers with a grain of salt,” Vaclavik says. “I think they should be more interested in revisions to old-crop demand numbers and overseas crop estimates. There will be a lot of attention paid and they report tomorrow morning.”

Will tomorrow’s report hold up to its reputation of being a key point in the marketing year? We’ll have to wait and see.

“Right now, the corn and soybean markets seem to be more fixated on the condition of the trade deal with China than anything else,” Seifried says.

Visit AgWeb.com on Friday, May 10 for complete coverage of USDA’s reports, which will be released at 11 a.m. CDT.

US Dept. of Energy Announces Frontier Supercomputer: Cray and AMD to Build 1.5 Exaflop Machine,https://www.anandtech.com,['Ryan Smith'],,,,https://www.anandtech.com/show/14302/us-dept-of-energy-announces-frontier-supercomputer-cray-and-amd-1-5-exaflops,"The history of the computing industry is one of constant progress. Processors get faster, storage gets cheaper, and memory gets denser. We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."
The Energy 202: Interior secretary blames Congress for lack of action on climate change,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/08/the-energy-202-interior-secretary-blames-congress-for-lack-of-action-on-climate-change/5cd1f58ca7a0a46cfe152c79/,"THE LIGHTBULB

David Bernhardt listens during a White House meeting in April. (Chris Kleponis/Pool via Bloomberg)

He acknowledged climate change is real. He acknowledged that humans are contributing to it.

So why, Democratic lawmakers asked David Bernhardt, isn't he doing more to address global warming?

Apparently, because Congress hasn't told him to.

During his first testimony to Congress since becoming interior secretary, Bernhardt said it is up to lawmakers to direct bureaucrats like himself to address the causes and effects of warming globally.

The punt back to lawmakers is likely to frustrate House Democrats who are trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire on climate change, since they know that any significant climate-related legislation to emerge from their chamber is likely to be rejected by either the president or the GOP-controlled Senate. At the same time, Democrats have only passed a single climate bill — one keeping the United States in the Paris climate accord — since taking the the majority.

The exchange came when Democrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Interior Department's budget pressed the Trump Cabinet official about why his department isn't doing more to assess and mitigate the effects of warming temperatures, acidifying oceans and other effects of climate change over the vast lands and waters stewarded by the Interior Department.

“Isn’t this really your job?” asked Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine).

Bernhardt pushed back against the assertion, arguing he has no legal obligation to act in response to climate change. ""My perspective on this is probably a little different than yours,"" he said.

He noted that of more than 600 instances in the law mandating the interior secretary to take some action, none tell him that he ""shall,"" as is the legal parlance, manage federal lands to stop global warming.

""There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said. ""You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

Pingee responded by asking Bernhardt to identify any legal barriers to acting on climate change. ""If there’s something legally stopping you, then we’re Congress,” she said. ""We make the laws.""

It is a lawyerly defense Bernhardt has turned to before, including in an interview last year with The Washington Post. Yet law or no law, climate change remains a threat to the land the Interior Department is tasked with overseeing.

In the national park system alone, warming temperatures threaten to undermine the very nature of many popular tourist spots, such as by melting the glaciers of Montana's Glacier National Park and imperilling the iconic Joshua trees of California's Joshua Tree National Park.

And the department holds considerable sway of the United States' overall contributions to climate change. A U.S. Geological Survey study published last year found that a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

Yet in the more than two years Donald Trump has been president, the Interior Department has sought to undo much of the previous administration's efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere undergirding that change.

Its action include rolling back rules designed to reduce the release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, from oil and natural gas wells and lifting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands.

During the hearing, Bernhardt said his department does not plan on easing up on oil and gas drilling on public lands when asked by Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the subcommittee’s chairwoman, if a recent United Nations report on the possible extinction of up to 1 million species worldwide gives him pause.

""Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,"" he said, again noting it is up to Congress to decide what the government does or does not allow on federal lands.

But when it came to the issue of drilling for oil and gas off the coasts of states outside the Gulf of Mexico, Bernhardt suggested he would give deference to local leaders.

""I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The department has put on pause plans to expand offshore drilling across the U.S. continental shelf after a recent federal court ruled against the Trump administration's effort to lift a current drilling ban in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. That decision came amid stiff opposition to offshore drilling from both Democratic and Republican politicians along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

POWER PLAYS

— More Interior Department drama: House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent letters urging a group of current and former Trump administration officials to provide information to the committee related to ongoing investigations, threatening to withhold salaries from anyone who seeks to hamper investigations. One letter threatened the salaries of any Interior officials that try to stop lawmakers from interviewing agency staff about whether Bernhardt complied with federal record-keeping laws.

— Fed prepares for climate risks to banks: Federal Reserve Jerome Powell told lawmakers in a letter last month the central bank has aimed to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather events,” to make sure banks are resilient to climate-related risks, the Wall Street Journal reports. That echoes comments the central banker made while testifying before Congress in late February, in which he said climate-risks are mostly a matter of bank supervision and not actual monetary policy.

— EPA must enforce Obama-era methane regulations, judge says: A federal judge in California has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin enforcing methane gas emission regulations that were established in 2016, E&E News reports. U.S . District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland ruled the Trump administration has been illegally delaying action to limit pollutants emitted from landfills across the country, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

Who's winning in California vs. Trump? Gilliam’s ruling is just the latest in a slew of environmental cases California has brought against the administration. And the Los Angeles Times reports the state is winning in nearly all of its efforts.

— The stalemate over Puerto Rico disaster funding gets worse: And it's because of the border wall. The Trump administration is looking to add emergency border funding to a disaster aid bill, a new obstacle that has further complicated ongoing negotiations over the multibillion-dollar disaster legislation, The Post’s Erica Werner reports. An ongoing feud between the president and congressional Democrats over Puerto Rico spending has already stalled negotiations. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) made a plea this week to Vice President Pence, who joined Senate Republicans for a closed-door lunch to talk about the disaster bill, that the introduction of a new spending element could tangle negotiations further.

THERMOMETER

— The partisan gulf in Congress over climate: There’s a stark contrast between how often Democratic and Republican lawmakers talk about climate change, The Post’s Philip Bump writes, compiling data from ProPublica to illustrate mentions of “climate” in congressional statements. The above graphic shows how that shakes out.

By contrast, Republican mentions of the “Green New Deal” outweigh those by Democrats, as Bump notes numerous Republican statements have been made to “express skepticism about the need to address the problem.”

— Starups targeting climate change struggle to rake in funding: The founder of the digital thermostat company Nest has met some obstacles in his mission to invest in start-up companies looking to tackle climate change. For one, the New York Times reports, not many venture capitalists have joined him in his quest to support such companies. Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which has been moving forward with carbon capture technology, is one company that has had success in raising money. But the Times writes the “current wave of internet-focused start-ups going public, and reaping billions of dollars for investors, has hardened the bias against so-called hard technology…In the time it took Carbon Engineering to raise one round of $68 million, Slack, a messaging company founded the same year, has raised more than 10 times as much and is now preparing for an initial public offering that could value it at nearly $20 billion.”

— Trump’s steel tariffs cost U.S. consumers $900,000 for every job created: That's according to an analysis by experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The reason it’s so high is that steel is a very capital-intensive industry. There are not many workers,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who did the cost calculation, told The Post’s Heather Long. Some Republicans and business leaders had hoped the president would have already removed the tariffs, and congressional Republicans have continued to pressure the administration to remove them “at least on Canada and Mexico, which are major feeders of metals to the United States,” Long adds.

On Tuesday, Volkswagen’s Porsche division announced it agreed to a 535 million euro, or $600 million, fine after German officials accused the car maker of selling almost 100,000 diesel SUVs with software meant to conceal excess emissions. Just a few months before, Kappanna, whose most recent role at G.M. was to communicate with the EPA about the company’s emissions technology, was called into a conference room to be let go. He received a severance package with two months of pay and a one-way ticket to India, where he returned soon after because he couldn’t find work before his 60-day grace period expired.

Dems moving forward with Barr contempt vote after DOJ talks break down,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Jordyn Hermani', 'Marianne Levine']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/william-barr-contempt-vote-1309622,"An assistant attorney general said executive privilege would be invoked if the House Judiciary Committee holds Attorney General William Barr in contempt. | Win McNamee/Getty Images congress Dems moving forward with Barr contempt vote after DOJ talks break down But the Justice Department threatens to ask Trump to invoke executive privilege to block a subpoena for the full Mueller report.

The Justice Department is preparing to ask the White House to invoke executive privilege over special counsel Robert Mueller's entire report and underlying evidence, a defensive move the night before Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are set to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to make the report's full contents available to Congress.

“In the face of the committee’s threatened contempt vote, the attorney general will be compelled to request that the president invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, asking the committee to hold off on its contempt proceedings.

Story Continued Below

The Justice Department’s latest move comes despite the fact that at least two lawmakers — Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — have already viewed a less-redacted version of Mueller's report than the one Barr made public last month.

Boyd emphasized that Trump has not yet asserted executive privilege but said Barr will urge the president to make a “protective” assertion of privilege if the committee proceeds with its contempt vote against Barr for defying the panel’s subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying evidence.

An invocation of executive privilege by the White House could tie up Democrats' efforts to gain access to the report in litigation and negotiations that could drag for months or even years. Though Democrats say such a move by the White House would be baseless and easily dispatched in court, it's not clear how long such a battle would take.

Nadler said that despite the Justice Department’s request, the contempt vote is still scheduled for Wednesday morning, and he challenged the Justice Department’s legal arguments.

“The department’s legal arguments are without credibility, merit, or legal or factual basis,” Nadler said. “Worse, this kind of obstruction is dangerous. The department’s decision reflects President Trump’s blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated duties.”

""In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration,"" Nadler continued. ""The Committee will also take a hard look at the officials who are enabling this cover up.""

The latest salvo from the Justice Department follows several hours of negotiating between the committee and Justice Department. Democrats say all members of Congress should have access to Mueller’s findings — especially the dozens of members on committees investigating conduct related to his report on links between the Trump campaign and Russia.

But Barr has permitted only 12 senior lawmakers — six Republicans and six Democrats — to view a minimally redacted version of the report. As of last week, only Collins and Graham said they’ve viewed the less-redacted report, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he intended to view it.

Earlier Tuesday, Justice Department officials huddled on Capitol Hill with committee staffers and presented an offer intended to head off Barr being cited for contempt. Their offer, according to two sources familiar with the matter, included allowing the 12 lawmakers already granted access to the report to bring two staff members — rather than one — to view the less-redacted report. DOJ also said those lawmakers and staff could keep any notes they took on the report.

But the offer did not include allowing additional lawmakers to access the report, making it a non-starter for Democrats. Nadler offered a counter-proposal late Tuesday that would have granted the full Judiciary and Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate access to the less-redacted report, an aide said.

Nadler’s counter-offer also included up to three staff members for each party and a commitment from the Justice Department to either support the committee’s efforts to access grand jury material contained in Mueller’s report, or a promise not to oppose the committee if it sought a court order to do so.

Finally, Nadler asked for a meeting to lay out a schedule to roll out lawmakers’ access to Mueller’s full underlying materials.

But the Justice Department rejected those terms, calling them “unreasonable demands” and said they were “a transparent attempt to short-circuit the constitutionally mandated accommodation process and provoke an unnecessary conflict between our respective branches of government.”

House Republicans defended the Justice Department’s argument.

“It appears that the more access to information Democrats receive, the less interested they are in actually examining those facts,” said Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee.

“Chairman Nadler, however, rebuffed the olive branch and plowed ahead with his plan to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt for upholding the law,” Collins added. “I can’t imagine a more illogical hill for a legislator to die on.”

The Justice Department also intends to continue shielding grand-jury information. Democrats have urged Barr to join them in seeking a court order to release that information so that the committee can use it for its ongoing obstruction of justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, the committee is still seeking testimony from Mueller himself and from former White House counsel Don McGahn, who is emerging as a central witness in the obstruction probe. McGahn earlier Tuesday refused to comply with the committee’s subpoena for documents related to that investigation after the White House instructed him to disregard House Democrats’ demands.

Nadler teed up the contempt vote on Monday after Barr signaled he would defy the panel’s subpoena for full, unredacted report and underlying evidence.

Boyd criticized Nadler last week in a letter indicating that the Justice Department would not comply with the subpoena, arguing that it amounts to an abuse of congressional authority. Democrats have accused the Justice Department of stonewalling their document requests and blasted Barr for what they said was an effort to spin Mueller’s findings.

While the fight for access to the unredacted report has centered on the Judiciary panel, the House Intelligence Committee has also demanded the full report in addition to the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information gathered throughout the investigation.

On Tuesday, a committee aide revealed that the Justice Department “has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony, even after Chairman [Adam] Schiff and ranking member [Devin] Nunes sent a follow-up letter in late April, almost a month after the DOJ did not respond to their first letter.”

In that follow-up letter, Schiff and Nunes said that absent “meaningful compliance” by Thursday of this week, the committee would “have no choice but to resort to compulsory process” beginning on Friday.

California to Ban Pesticide Said to Harm Child Development,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/05/08/california-to-ban-pesticide-said-to-harm-child-development/,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The nation’s most productive agricultural state will ban a widely used pesticide blamed for harming brain development in babies, California officials said Wednesday.

The move cheered by environmental groups would outlaw chlorpyrifos (klohr-PY’-rih-fohs) after scientists deemed it a toxic air contaminant and discovered it to be more dangerous than previously thought. State Environmental Secretary Jared Blumenfeld said it’s the first time the state has sought to ban a pesticide and the move was overdue.

“This pesticide is a neurotoxin and it was first put on the market in 1965,” Blumenfeld said. “So it’s been on the shelf a long time and it’s past its sell-by date.”

The decision comes after regulators in several states have taken steps in recent years to restrict the pesticide currently used on about 60 different crops in California, including grapes, almonds and oranges.

Hawaii banned it last year and New York lawmakers recently sent a bill to the governor outlawing use of the pesticide.

DowDuPont, which produces the pesticide, said it was disappointed with the decision and that it would hurt farmers who rely on it to control insects.

Blumenfeld said the state took action in part because the federal government allowed the pesticide to be used after the Obama Administration tried to phase it out.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump reversed that effort after re-evaluating the science. Environmental groups and farmworkers challenged that decision and a federal appeals court last month ordered the EPA to decide by July whether to ban the pesticide.

“This is a historic victory for California’s agricultural communities and for children nationwide,” said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The science clearly shows that chlorpyrifos is too dangerous to use in our fields. Since California uses more chlorpyrifos than any other state, this ban will not only protect kids who live here, but kids who eat the fruits and veggies grown here.”

The pesticide is in a class of organophosphates chemically similar to a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany before World War II. Its heavy use has often left traces in drinking water sources. A University of California at Berkeley study in 2012 found that 87% of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of the pesticide.

Dr. Gina Solomon, a medical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and former deputy secretary of Cal-EPA, said chlorpyrifos is unusual in that it’s one of the best understood pesticides because it’s been so extensively studied.

“We know a lot about what it does to developing children and that science is the bedrock of the action that Cal-EPA is announcing,” she said. “Many pesticides have been studied well in lab rats but in this case we actually know what it does to people.”

Studies in cities where the pesticide was once used to kill cockroaches before it was banned for indoor use in 2000 and in rural farmworker communities showed it harmed brain development in fetuses and affected reading ability, IQ and led to hyperactivity in children, Solomon said. Even head sizes were smaller in children whose mothers were exposed to the pesticide.

While the ban — technically known as a cancellation — could take up to two years to take effect, the state Department of Pesticide Regulation has recommended that county agriculture commissioners adopt stricter rules on where and how the chemical can be applied, including larger buffer zones.

Use of the pesticide has been reduced by more than half in California since 2005 to just under 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) used on crops in 2016, according to the state.

To help farmers make the transition away from chlorpyrifos, the state is adding a $5.7 million to fund development of safer alternatives.

While most environmental groups applauded the announcement, Earthjustice said it would continue pushing legislation to ban the chemical because it questions whether the Department of Pesticide Regulation will follow through.

“It’s been like pulling teeth to force DPR to begin the cancellation process for chlorpyrifos,” said Greg Loarie, Earthjustice attorney. “Until we know that chlorpyrifos is gone for good, we are going to keep pushing as hard as we can in as many places as we can.”"
Minnesota military veteran sues State Department after twice being denied U.S. passport,https://www.twincities.com,['Amy Forliti'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/09/minnesota-military-veteran-sues-state-department-after-twice-being-denied-u-s-passport/,"A Minnesota man and military veteran whose request for a passport was denied twice is now asking a federal court to intervene and declare that he is a U.S. citizen, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday.

The complaint, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, says the U.S. State Department has required information from Mark Esqueda that is burdensome and goes beyond what is legally required. Both of his passport applications were made during President Barack Obama’s administration.

Esqueda’s lawsuit says that he was born in the U.S. and is entitled to rights of citizenship, including the right to travel freely across U.S. borders. The suit names Secretary of State Michael Pompeo as a defendant.

“To have them question my citizenship is an insult,” Esqueda, 30, of Lake Huron in southwestern Minnesota, said in a statement. “I was born here, raised here and served my country here.”

The State Department says it does not comment on pending litigation.

According to the complaint, Esqueda was born in Hidalgo, Texas, in 1988 and a midwife and police officer were present during his birth. He spent most of his childhood in Minnesota, served in the Marines from 2007 to 2011 and later served in the National Guard. While in the Marines, he served in Iraq and Afghanistan and held a military clearance level of “secret,” which the lawsuit says is given only to U.S. citizens and required a thorough background check.

Esqueda applied for a passport in 2012 and included a copy of his birth certificate. The State Department requested additional information, but Esqueda did not have it and his application was denied, the lawsuit says.

He spent the next several years gathering more documentation and applied for a passport again in 2015. This time, he also provided a signed report from the police officer who was at his birth, documentation about his military security clearance and information about government benefits his family received when he was a child.

The complaint says the State Department demanded more information, alleging the midwife at Esqueda’s birth was unreliable. Esqueda then submitted five affidavits from friends and family in Hidalgo, but his application was ultimately denied in January 2017.

The lawsuit says Esqueda is concerned that questions about his citizenship will put his other rights in jeopardy. He’s asking a judge to declare that he is a U.S. citizen and is entitled to a passport."
U.S. Department of Labor cites Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen,https://www.ksn.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.ksn.com/news/kansas/us-department-of-labor-cites-spirit-aerosystems-for-exposing-employees-to-carcinogen/1989850964,"WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen hazards. The company faces penalties of $193,218 for two repeated and four serious violations.

OSHA alleges the company failed to implement feasible engineering controls to limit employee exposure to hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and conduct periodic monitoring of employee exposure. OSHA also alleges the company failed to establish protocols to ensure that employees remove contaminated personal protective equipment and clothing before leaving the work area.

OSHA also alleges the company failed to prevent exposure to hexavalent chromium during aircraft painting and allowed the accumulation of hexavalent chromium on surfaces and failed to ensure that employee respirators fit properly.

""Inhaling excessive levels of hexavalent chromium can cause asthma, and damage to the kidneys, liver, and respiratory system,"" said OSHA Wichita Acting Area Office Director Ryan Hodge. ""It is important for employers to take the appropriate steps necessary to prevent excessive exposure.""

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA's area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Microsoft and VA team up to help disabled veterans play video games,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com,['Joshua Axelrod'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com/news/transition/2019/05/08/microsoft-and-va-team-up-to-help-disabled-veterans-play-video-games/,"Disabled veteran gamers are in for a treat thanks to a recent partnership between Microsoft and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Xbox adaptive controller was created so veterans with disabilities and others can play “Halo,” “Kingdom Hearts 3” or whatever games they’re into just as everyone else can.

“It’s a very different approach to a game controller from what I think people conceptualize a game controller to be,” said Bryce Johnson, the inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices. “This is not one-size fits all; this is the opposite of that. You can use this thing to adapt to you.”

Rebootcamp Recommendations

While the controller is currently available to buy, Microsoft donated controllers, consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment to 22 VA rehab centers around the country. Veterans can use the controllers for free at facilities in Washington, D.C., Texas, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, New York and California.

The idea for the adaptive controller was born during the 2015 edition of Microsoft’s annual hackathon, according to Johnson. That’s when Johnson and his Microsoft colleagues met Sgt. Josh Price, who had lost his right arm from his elbow down.

Johnson recalled watching Price use a customized Xbox controller created by Ken Jones, founder of the nonprofit Warfighter Engaged, which is dedicated to coming up with innovative ways for the disabled to enjoy gaming.

“It was super important for us to see it because we had to recognize what people were going through to play games and how much they were willing to do,” Johnson said.

After developing their own adaptive controller, Microsoft approached the VA to make sure veterans had access to it at their facilities.

“The options for video-gaming have been relatively limited,” said Dr. Leif Nelson, the VA’s director of national veterans sports programs and special events. “That’s what’s exciting about this: It’s another option for us to open up the world of esports.”

Jones has been working in adaptive gaming since 2012, when he began to use his engineering skills to create custom controllers for specific disabilities upon request. He eventually turned those projects into Warfighter Engaged, and he was delighted to work with Microsoft on their Xbox adaptive controller.

He said that Xbox controllers can be modified to “do just about anything,” which makes adapting them for veterans’ individual needs fairly simple.

“So it’s about as universal as you’re possibly going to get,” Jones said. “It’s basically a dream come true for people who modify controllers and for people who need it.”

Gaming is also a therapeutic tool for veterans, both physically and mentally, Jones said. That’s why making it easier for veterans to play, through innovations like the Xbox adaptive controller, is a big deal.

“There is some physical therapy going on there,” he said. “It’s moving your muscles around. But a lot of it is cognitive therapy decision-making. It’s just a way of relaxing and doing something that you wanted to do before.”

Nelson, who is a doctor of physical therapy, said gaming can also help veterans avoid isolation.

“It’s a community now and a way to socially engage and interact,” Nelson said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do with our veterans.”

That element of gaming was vital for Dave Crouse, a Marine Corps veteran and director of veterans services at video-game nonprofit Stack Up. He said that the military lifestyle while deployed is a lot of “hurry up and wait,” and many of those extra hours are spent playing video games.

Crouse served from 2003 to 2014 and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal. He lost his left hand and left eye during an operation in Cambodia in 2013, so he knows exactly how crucial video games can be for a veteran’s recovery and how useful something like the Xbox adaptive controller can be for that purpose.

”For me, it is the perfect form of escapism,” he said. “It engages me mentally and physically, and it gives me this cool escape, whether it’s just to decompress or to put some distance between me and the challenges I’m facing.”

There are many ways for veterans to deal with the lingering effects of PTSD, from motorcycle-riding to extreme sports. The best method for Crouse has been playing video games, and products like the Xbox adaptive controller give him and many others the means to continue participating in an activity they love."
Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442716-dems-want-asbestos-ban-now-epa-says-it-needs-more-time,"House Democrats hope to sidestep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a bill that would ban asbestos within a year.

In a Wednesday hearing before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, Democrats grilled EPA chemical staff on why the agency hasn’t taken more restrictive actions on the harmful substance three years after passing a law to give the agency more authority to regulate dangerous chemicals.

“I wish today’s hearing wasn’t necessary and this bill wasn't necessary, but asbestos is still being imported into the U.S. and still being used in this country, and still killing about 40,000 Americans every year,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneHillicon Valley: Facebook co-founder calls for breaking up company | Facebook pushes back | Experts study 2020 candidates to offset 'deepfake' threat | FCC votes to block China Mobile | Groups, lawmakers accuse Amazon of violating children's privacy House votes to overturn Trump ObamaCare move Bipartisan lawmakers call on FCC to prioritize 5G security MORE (D-N.J.). ADVERTISEMENT

The EPA has been under heavy criticism for its latest action on asbestos, something the agency argues will limit the use of asbestos in the U.S. but critics say could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

The agency has resisted calls to ban the cancer-causing substance outright, even against the wishes of some of its staff, arguing it must continue to go through its risk evaluation process, even if lengthier than some might prefer.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that senior EPA officials ignored the advice of scientists and lawyers in restricting rather than banning asbestos.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote in a memo from August.

The memo alarmed subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord MORE (D-N.Y.).

“Based on some of these communications it seems clear that numerous EPA career staff believe the agency is not fully pursuing efforts to reduce asbestos exposure, and I hope these expert voices have a role as the process moves forward,” he said.

Asbestos is still sometimes used in the construction of roads and production of chlorine, among other products, but more than 60 countries have banned the use of the substance or products that contain it.

“The U.S. must do the same,” argued Tonko, but “I have little confidence that EPA will move forward on a reasonable timeline with the only acceptable outcome: a complete asbestos ban.”

Congress banned asbestos in 1989 but a court overturned that law in 1991, allowing limited uses of asbestos to continue.

Committee Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, trying to sidestep a science-based EPA process that could help the agency avoid future litigation.

“Let me be honest here.

“I’m concerned about the immediate loss of 36 percent — that’s over one third — of our national chlorine production” and the risk that would pose to hospitals and drinking water supplies, he said.

For its part, the EPA continues to stress that its rule is the first meaningful action on asbestos in 30 years.

Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, told the committee the rule is an “aggressive and critical step” in addressing asbestos, stressing the need to go through a measured process in considering the risk factors associated with asbestos.

Dunn told The Hill in April that the agency may eventually ban asbestos.

Committee Democrats made clear they have lost faith in Dunn’s office under the Trump administration.

“Unfortunately, it’s now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the Trump EPA is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals,” Pallone Jr. said, adding that EPA’s actions “have been so legally suspect we need to pass this bill regardless of whether EPA were to announce it’s moving forward with a full ban of asbestos.”"
Why Trump's claim of executive privilege is different,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/donald-trump-executive-privilege/index.html,"(CNN) Maybe what's going on with Trump and Congress and executive privilege is relatively tame, since it has to do only with a report on allegations of Russian election interference and obstruction of justice.

When President Thomas Jefferson argued in 1807 that he didn't have to fully comply with a subpoena for documents, he was having his former vice president tried for treason for attempting to incite a revolution out West. The former-vice-president-turned-frontier-revolutionary on trial was Aaron Burr, of ""Hamilton"" dueling fame. The Supreme Court, in the voice of Jefferson's foil Chief Justice John Marshall, disagreed with the President's argument, Jefferson ultimately coughed up the documents Burr wanted for his defense and Burr ultimately walked free.

Fast-forward 170 years, and Chief Justice Warren Burger used the Burr trial in deciding that President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena by the special counsel for his taped Oval Office conversations.

None of these cases are exactly the same. Jefferson was responding to a subpoena in a criminal trial. Nixon was responding to a subpoena by a special prosecutor. Trump, in invoking a blanket claim of executive privilege Wednesday, was responding to a subpoena from Congress for the Mueller report.

But they all share the idea that presidents should be able to keep secrets from Congress in order to do their jobs. The term itself -- executive privilege -- dates back only to the Eisenhower administration. And while it isn't in the Constitution, the idea has been a matter of considerable debate since George Washington first employed it with regard to congressional inquiries about the postwar Jay Treaty of 1795 between the US and Great Britain.

This is not a secret or under-analyzed subject. Books upon books have been written about it and just about every recent generation has had a knock-down crisis moment fight about it, particularly when presidents have used the idea of executive privilege to cover up missteps.

During his 1807 trial for treason, former vice president Aaron Burr subpoenaed documents from President Thomas Jefferson.

""The weakest claims of executive privilege involve administrations attempting to cover up embarrassing or politically inconvenient information, or even outright wrongdoing,"" write Mark Rozell of George Mason University and Mitchel Sollenberger of the University of Michigan-Dearborn in one study

They point out, however, that there is a sound need for the president to get candid advice and also to keep information from the public.

""Presidents rely heavily on being able to consult with advisers, without fear of public disclosure of their deliberations,"" write Rozell and Sollenberger. ""Executive privilege recognizes this notion. Indeed, in U.S. v. Nixon, the Supreme Court not only recognized the constitutionality of executive privilege, but the occasional need for secrecy to the operation of the presidency.""

A brief history

In his memoirs, Nixon expressed regret that he had weakened the principle.

""I was the first president to test the principle of executive privilege in the Supreme Court, and by testing it on such a weak ground, I probably ensured the defeat of my cause,"" he wrote.

There has been an ebb and flow ever since.

Bill Clinton tried to use it more than any other president since Watergate as he fought the Whitewater investigation and dealt with fallout from the Monica Lewinsky affair, President Ronald Reagan sought to expand the idea.Bill Clinton tried to use it more than any other president since Watergate as he fought the Whitewater investigation and dealt with fallout from the Monica Lewinsky affair, according to the academics . He ultimately dropped the claim of executive privilege in regard to testimony to Congress about Lewinsky.

Congress considered but ultimately did not move on an impeachment charge against Clinton having to do with abuse of executive privilege, according to Rozell and Sollenberger. Clinton invoked executive privilege 14 times, according to a tally by the Congressional Research Service in 2012, more than twice the tally of any other modern president.

(Yes, Congress can technically arrest people, but it hasn't tried in more than 70 years.) President George W. Bush tried to expand it even further and strengthen the power of the presidency. He signed an executive order that gave the current president the ability to assert executive privilege over the documents of previous presidents. He also got into snits with Congress over using the idea to shield top aides like Karl Rove from congressional testimony. Back then, CNN's Jim Acosta reported on where Congress might put someone like Rove in jail if it tried to arrest him (Yes, Congress can technically arrest people, but it hasn't tried in more than 70 years.)

President Barack Obama made a big deal of rolling back Bush's view of executive privilege, but then he asserted it himself on behalf of his attorney general, Eric Holder, who was held in contempt of court over the Fast and Furious gun sale scandal . A federal judge ultimately made Holder turn over documents.

Trump's claim is different

Trump's assertion, however, is a blanket assertion of privilege for anything relating to the special counsel report on the Russia investigation. It's nontraditional in some ways, since privilege is usually asserted for close aides and in Trump's case it is for an investigation into his administration and 2016 political campaign. It's also very broad, and seemingly pertains in a protective way to all congressional inquiries related to Mueller.

""This protective assertion of executive privilege ensures the President's ability to make a final decision whether to assert privilege following a full review of these materials,"" wrote Stephen Boyd, a Justice Department official, in a letter Wednesday to the House Judiciary Committee.

""Executive privilege claims customarily come with an underlying rationale such as national security, protecting internal deliberations or protecting ongoing DOJ investigations,"" Rozell told CNN in an email. ""In this case the President has claimed some 'protective' executive privilege which is entirely too broad and without any precedent (excepting equally broad claims such as President Nixon's that failed the constitutional standard). It seems the President believes he can wall off any and all information or testimony by merely uttering the words 'executive privilege.' ""

One problem for Democrats right now is that they have asked for essentially every document related to the Mueller report, something they may not ever get.

Timothy Naftali, a New York University historian who's the former head of the Nixon presidential library, said Wednesday on CNN that they should be more specific and detailed in their requests.

""I think at this moment a lot of Americans are just seeing the Republicans and Democrats screaming at each other, and the details -- which are so important -- are being lost,"" he said, arguing that Trump is making his broad claim of privilege because he thinks most people will see only the political back and forth rather than understand what, specifically, Democrats are trying to get.

""Usually disputes over executive privilege get resolved through an accommodation process between Congress and the White House,"" Rozell observed. ""We seem to be stuck now in a zero-sum game with each side digging in.""

Regardless, this is now a fight destined for the courts. And these things take time. It took a year from the time Nixon refused to release the tapes till the Supreme Court ruled against him. It was four years from the time Obama made his executive privilege claim regarding Fast and Furious before a judge rejected it . And even then the legal fight over the documents continued into the Trump administration"
"FBI, DHS officials deny agencies less focused on homegrown attacks than other threats",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-dhs-officials-deny-agencies-less-focused-on-homegrown-attacks-than-other-threats,"National security officials on Wednesday denied an April report that the Trump administration's dissolution of a Department of Homeland Security advisory group on domestic terrorism threats led the agency to pay less attention to the problem.

Five weeks ago, the Daily Beast reported Homeland Security in late 2018 shuttered a group within its Office of Intelligence and Analysis that had tracked homegrown violent extremists and domestic terrorists. The analysts had shared federal findings with state and local law enforcement.

On Wednesday, Brian Murphy, principal deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the department, took issue with the report.

“I would like to begin by responding directly to recent inaccurate press reporting that DHS has dramatically reduced its efforts on domestic terrorism,"" Murphy told members of the House Homeland Security Committee.

""I can assure the committee and the American public that throughout the careful calculus of balancing resources and adapting to an ever-changing threat landscape, DHS remains acutely focused on the threat from domestic terrorism,” Murphy said.

Michael C. McGarrity, assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, told lawmakers at the hearing, ""We don't differentiate between a domestic terrorism attack we're trying to stop or an international terrorism attack. It's a terrorism attack we're looking to stop.""

Murphy did not deny the closing of Homeland Security's intelligence and analysis branch, but he defended the disbandment as a move that allowed the FBI to take the lead on domestic terrorism issues rather than Homeland Security.

“DHS decided that it should pivot to reporting on domestic terrorism to better support the National Strategy for Counterterrorism, enable DHS to more effectively coordinate our resources and capabilities, and better serve the needs of states and local communities that rely on the rapid production of information to combat this threat,” Murphy said.

In the past month, three mass shootings have taken place: at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a Poway synagogue in Southern California, and a school outside Denver."
"Schiff, Nunes send joint letter blasting DOJ for stonewalling on documents",https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-nunes-send-joint-letter-blasting-doj-for-stonewalling-on-documents,"The leaders of the House Intelligence Committee have threatened to issue a rare bipartisan subpoena that would compel the Justice Department to turn over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's complete and unredacted report on the Russia investigation, as well as allow Mueller himself to brief the committee about the probe.

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""
