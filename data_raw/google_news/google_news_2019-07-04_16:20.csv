Rep. Justin Amash announces he is leaving GOP; Trump calls it 'great news',https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-rep-justin-amash-quits-gop-says-he-is-frightened-by-party-politics,"Michigan Rep. Justin Amash announced Thursday that he is leaving the Republican Party, saying he is disenchanted and “frightened” by party politics -- a move that was quickly described as ""great news"" by President Trump.

JUSTIN AMASH GONE FROM HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS AFTER SAYING TRUMP'S CONDUCT WAS 'IMPEACHABLE'

Amash, a libertarian and a critic of President Trump, made the announcement in an op-ed for The Washington Post, in which he said he had once run as a Republican due to the GOP’s belief in limited government, economic freedom and individual liberty.

""In recent years, though, I’ve become disenchanted with party politics and frightened by what I see from it,” he said in the op-ed. “The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions.”

Trump soon responded, calling Amash's departure ""great news"" for the GOP and suggesting he quit because he was likely to lose to a primary challenge for his re-election bid.

""Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress is 'quitting' the Party,"" Trump tweeted. ""No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn’t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!""

Amash is the only House Republican to have called for Trump’s impeachment, and his announcement comes weeks after he resigned from the conservative House Freedom Caucus in June. Amash had said he didn't want to be a ""further distraction"" for the caucus.

""Some of the president's actions were inherently corrupt,"" Amash tweeted in May about the findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report. ""Other actions were corrupt -- and therefore impeachable -- because the president took them to serve his own interests.""

However, despite his clashes with Trump, Amash did not mention the president in his op-ed Thursday, citing instead “the consolidation of political power and near disintegration of representative democracy.”

DONALD TRUMP JR. TAKES ON JUSTIN AMASH ON TWITTER OVER IMPEACHMENT COMMENTS

“The parties value winning for its own sake, and at whatever cost. Instead of acting as an independent branch of government and serving as a check on the executive branch, congressional leaders of both parties expect the House and Senate to act in obedience or opposition to the president and their colleagues on a partisan basis,” he wrote.

Amash argues that while Congress was envisioned as a deliberative body to discover new outcomes, instead it has become a formality to legitimize instructions from the president or Congressional leadership.

“With little genuine debate on policy happening in Congress, party leaders distract and divide the public by exploiting wedge issues and waging pointless messaging wars,” he argued. “These strategies fuel mistrust and anger, leading millions of people to take to social media to express contempt for their political opponents, with the media magnifying the most extreme voices.“

He calls on Americans to preserve liberty by “telling the Republican Party and the Democratic Party that we’ll no longer let them play their partisan game at our expense.”

“No matter your circumstance, I’m asking you to join me in rejecting the partisan loyalties and rhetoric that divide and dehumanize us,” he said."
Opinion | Why Trump Likes Tanks,https://www.nytimes.com,['Elliott D. Woods'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/opinion/trump-tanks.html,"In the winter of 2001, as a trainee at the Army’s combat engineer school at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., I learned how to stop a tank dead in its tracks. I learned how to use tubular 40-pound cratering charges wrapped in blocks of C-4 to blow a ditch as deep and wide as a school bus. I learned to lay mines capable of blowing the tracks off a tank.

But even as I was learning those skills, they were already outdated. The collapse of the Soviet Union a decade earlier made it improbable that American troops would ever have to defend Western Europe against tanks. In 21st-century wars, we soldiers would almost never confront an enemy tank, though all of us would come to fear the enemy’s capacity to make a mockery of American armor using kitchen explosives.

With a few exceptions — the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the battle of Falluja in 2004 — the tank has become as irrelevant to modern warfare as the horse cavalry it replaced. Primarily designed to roll over fences and trenches and to knock out other tanks in World War I-type and World War II-type battles, tanks have been reduced to serving, in effect, as heavy, expensive bunkers. They struggle to maneuver anywhere but open terrain (which means they are as likely to become an obstacle as they are to breech one) and they bleed the supply chain (it takes about 10 gallons of fuel just to start an M1 Abrams tank, and its engines get fewer than two miles per gallon).

So what are we supposed to make of President Trump’s fascination with these hulking relics and his determination to display them in Washington during Thursday’s Fourth of July celebration?"
Replacement for cartoonist who drew Trump golfing over migrant bodies rejects the job after backlash,https://www.cnn.com,['Madeline Holcombe'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/media/trump-canadian-cartoon-replacement/index.html,"(CNN) The replacement for the cartoonist who said he was fired from Brunswick News Inc. newspapers for a political cartoon of President Donald Trump says the controversy has made him not want the job, according to CNN news partner CBC.

Cartoonist Greg Perry has told the Canadian newspaper publishing company that he no longer wants the job and wants his cartoons kept off the editorial pages, citing the social media backlash that quickly descended when the company ended 17-year veteran Michael de Adder's contract, according to CBC.

""I don't use social media, but person/persons who do have used it to essentially destroy my character and my cartoon work,"" Perry said in a statement to the outlet. ""All this over a job that pays the same per month as a job at a grocery chain. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.""

The publishing company offered its support of Perry as he relinquished the freelance position.

""He is a talented cartoonist who has been unfairly maligned by the false narrative which recklessly erupted on social media in recent days,"" the company said in a statement.

Tweeting Trump causes surreal uproar with census reversal,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/politics/donald-trump-immigration-census-2020-courts/index.html,"The President's latest reach for untamed executive power led him into yet another surreal head to head with the courts as Independence Day approached.

He forged ahead Wednesday even though the Supreme Court had previously frozen his efforts on the matter and the Justice Department, apparently conceding they had weak case, had given up. And he tweeted early on Independence Day that people from the departments of Commerce and Justice were working over the holiday to resolve the issue

Going into the hearing on Tuesday where the Justice Department said the administration would not print the census with the question, there was ""consensus"" including from the White House on the position the DOJ took, according to a US government official. But, a source familiar says after the Tuesday hearing the President's position on the census shifted, something top DOJ officials including Attorney General William Barr became aware of before the President's tweet.

Trump's stance led to an extraordinary exchange between a Maryland judge and a government lawyer hauled back from vacation who was clearly as confused over the drama as anyone else.

""I don't know how many federal judges have Twitter accounts, but I happen to be one of them and I follow the President,"" said Judge George Hazel on a conference call with case lawyers.

""And so I saw a tweet that directly contradicted the position (the government) shared with me yesterday.""

The unfortunate Justice Department lawyer Joshua Gardner was forced to admit he had no clue either and so became the latest government official to be professionally undermined by the President's whims.

""The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the President's position on this issue,"" Gardner said.

""Obviously, as you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what's going on,"" Gardner said, according to a court transcript of the conference call.

The President acted following a backlash on pro-Trump media about a cause dear to the conservative movement's heart after the Justice Department appeared to lose faith.

Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tweeted that if the case was really over , ""it would be one of the biggest legal defeats of the Trump presidency.""

Presented with a choice between the reality established by the courts or a potential blow to his standing in his political base, Trump made a familiar move.

""The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday.

""We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.""

Doubts raised over the functioning of government

It would not be the first time that Trump has bowed to the conservative media machine. He backed out of a deal with Democrats on immigration amid conservative fury over the compromise.

But the head-spinning developments on Wednesday pose deeper questions than Trump's relationship with his conservative base.

They stir fresh uncertainty about his respect for the rule of law and the rulings of the courts -- including the Supreme Court. Given the flurry of challenges to the President's refusal to submit to constitutionally authorized congressional oversight, this is an issue that will shortly become even more acute.

The Supreme Court last week upheld a lower court ruling that the government had violated legal procedure and the Constitution by adding a citizenship question to the census.

Trump has said that it would be ""ridiculous"" not to include such a question. But government lawyers may struggle to find other arguments to alter the Supreme Court majority on the issue.

""Their position was hopeless. This tweet doesn't make their position any less hopeless. ... It's just nuts,"" said CNN Chief Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

It was not clear whether Trump meant officials to press ahead with a census that includes the citizenship question -- or whether he wants to launch a new longshot legal challenge to make it feasible.

It's also possible he knows that the effort is doomed but wants to show his supporters he's putting up a tough fight.

Wednesday's developments were yet another example of the chaotic nature of an administration that often lurches from day to day based on the President's erratic decisions and policy reversals. It's a tendency that has recently been in evidence especially on foreign and trade policy.

It's a state of affairs that suggests a worrying lack of continuity when one arm of the government has no idea what the other is doing from moment to moment.

It would not be a surprise if Trump reacts to Hazel's intervention with a fresh attacks on the judiciary itself. He has frequent responded to judges who block his policies by alleging a political conspiracy. Things got so heated after a district court ruling against his asylum policies that Chief Justice John Roberts issued an unprecedented statement that implicitly rebuked the President.

""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,"" Roberts said. Hazel was nominated by President Barack Obama.

Checks on presidential power

The way in which courts have frustrated Trump reflects the fact that the judiciary has been one of the most effective checks on the President's power.

Trump can walk into North Korea, as he did on Sunday, can commandeer Washington's July Fourth celebrations, brand the media the ""enemies of the people"" and undermine truth.

But the power of the President of the United States can be held in check by a humble district court judge.

That doesn't make the mercurial President any easier to work for, as Gardner found out on Wednesday, as he tried to salvage his reputation.

""I've been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years, through multiple administrations, and I've always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court,"" he told the judge.

Other top government officials, like former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- who Trump told not to waste his time talking to North Koreans in a 2017 tweet -- might pity Gardner.

More recently, the President gave his trade chief Robert Lighthizer a dressing down in front of a Chinese delegation when he ordered him to stop using the phrase ""memorandum of understanding."" MOUs are now non grata in the White House.

While Hazel appeared sympathetic with Gardner's plight, he was clearly frustrated.

""If you were Facebook and an attorney for Facebook told me one thing and then I read a press release from Mark Zuckerberg telling me something else, I would be demanding that Mark Zuckerberg appear in court with you the next time because I would be saying 'I don't think you speak for your client."" Hazel said.

A US government official told CNN on Thursday that the census printing without a citizenship question is still going forward.

The judge gave the Justice Department until 2 p.m. ET Friday to either confirm the government would not put a citizenship question on the census or to say how it will pursue the case.

But even a federal judge can only do so much.

""Maybe I'm wrong about this, that the parties are not suggesting I can enjoin the President of the United States from tweeting things?"" he said.

Strzok-Page texts debated whether to share details with DOJ on key London meeting in 2016,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/strzok-page-texts-london-meeting-justice-department,"Text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page debating how much information to share with the Justice Department about a London meeting -- days after the bureau opened its initial Russia investigation -- are drawing fresh scrutiny as alleged surveillance abuse and the probe’s origins are investigated by three separate probes, Fox News has learned.

On Aug. 3, 2016, Strzok wrote, ""I think we need to consider the lines of what we disclose to DOJ. For example, the last stipulation notes we will not disclose [the] identifies outside the FBI. I think you might argue the unauthorized disclosure might (reasonably) be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to US national security...""

In an earlier discussion on Aug. 2, 2016, Strzok reported he had a “good meeting.” Page warned, ""Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress, foia (Freedom of Information Act), etc. I'm sure it's fine. I just don't know how protection of intel-type stuff works in that context.""

Fox News has learned some of the words and names that were redacted in the string of Strzok-Page messages; they are included below.

[NOTE: 'OUTBOX' messages are from Page, 'INBOX' messages from Strzok]

The New York Times was first to report lengthy details about the 2016 meeting in question, when the FBI ""dispatched a pair of agents to London on a mission so secretive that all but a handful of officials were kept in the dark."" The report said this assignment included questioning Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer. Downer's information about then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos helped lay the foundation for the FBI’s counterintelligence probe – which later grew into former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

House Republicans, continuing to probe the texts, have considered August 2016 a pivotal month. They have been looking closely at these exchanges, and how long before the August meeting Downer reported the Papadopoulos information.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, meanwhile, has been conducting a separate investigation into alleged surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign, with that case in its final phases. And, this past May, Attorney General William Barr asked U.S. Attorney John Durham to probe the origins of the FBI counterintelligence case which was opened in late July 2016 by then-agent Strzok.

Fox News also has learned what's behind some of the redactions for the texts during that period, revealing new details of the Strzok meeting which took place at the U.S. embassy in London inside a secure facility known as SCIF.

In the texts, Strzok said the meeting did not include the No. 2 State Department official in London known as the deputy chief of mission.

""Was DCM (deputy chief of mission) present for the interview?"" Page asked.

""No, two of them, two of us."" Strzok responded.

Other texts indicated then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was trying to reach someone named “Jeremy” and make multiple references to “Ben,” though it’s not clear if they worked within or outside the FBI.

Strzok and Page then discussed how widely the information needed to be shared within the bureau, including Strzok’s immediate supervisor Bill Priestap.

Page wrote on Aug. 3, 2016, ""New case. Information flow. Control."" The section that followed was heavily redacted, but Strzok responded, “...plan on telling Bill I'm obviously going to tell him anything he wants to know, but recommend we not tell him or [higher] … specific data so that he and higher can tell DOJ, even we don't know the admin details.""

Horowitz also has been investigating leaks from senior FBI officials as part of his probes. The expectation is that report will come after the surveillance abuse investigation.

In an apparent reference to bureau leaks, Strzok wrote, ""this is MUCH more tasty for one of those (redacted) aholes to leak. For the first time in a while I'm not worried about our side.""

Border agency knew about secret Facebook group for years,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Cristiano Lima']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/03/border-agency-secret-facebook-group-1569572,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan pledged to hold any culpable agents accountable. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images employment & immigration Border agency knew about secret Facebook group for years Border Patrol leadership knew about photos posted to the group as far back as 2016, when agents reported them, according to a DHS official.

Customs and Border Protection officials have been aware for up to three years that a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents was posting offensive messages — far longer than previously reported.

Border Patrol leadership knew about photos posted to the group as far back as 2016, when agents reported them, according to a current Homeland Security official. The images — several of which were provided to POLITICO — show agents engaging in conduct that includes simulating sex acts and taking selfies while defecating. A former DHS official said he was aware of the Facebook group during the past year.

Story Continued Below

Neither official knew of any serious punishment ever leveled at members of the Facebook group.

ProPublica reported Monday that comments in the “I’m 10-15” Facebook group posted as recently as last week mocked the death of a 16-year-old detained Guatemalan migrant, made bigoted remarks about throwing a burrito at two Latina congresswomen, and posted obscene and misogynistic illustrations of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). The group’s name refers to the code used to signal “aliens in custody.”

Top Homeland Security Department officials, including acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan and Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost, denounced those posts this week and pledged to hold any culpable agents accountable.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan wrote. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

But screen shots provided to POLITICO and interviews with the two DHS officials indicate that the agency wasn't blindsided by ProPublica’s report. Staffers in CBP’s public affairs office monitored the Facebook group over the past year “as a source of intelligence” to see “what people are talking about,” according to the former DHS official.

“We were not talking about ‘10-15’ as a liability or an asset or as an item of concern,” the former official said.

In one screenshot that the current DHS official says was flagged in 2016 to then-Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan, an agent — carrying a gun in a holster — simulated sex with a training mannequin in the desert. In another, what appeared to be the same agent smiled while holding what appeared to be a human skull. The caption made reference to handling “a little human remains” during canine training.

Morgan, who was recently named acting chief of CBP, did not answer POLITICO's request for comment.

A third photo showed an agent’s unzipped green pants lowered below his knees while in a squatting position, in what appeared to be a selfie taken while defecating in the Arizona desert, according to the tagged location. The image was flagged to then-Tucson Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez, the current official said. Chavez did not answer POLITICO's request for comment.

A CBP spokesperson told POLITICO Wednesday evening that the incidents were reported at the time to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which launched and concluded investigations. The spokesperson said that due to due privacy policies, the agency could not disclose additional information, including whether disciplinary action was taken.

The former DHS official who declined to be identified argued that neither DHS nor CBP possesses the manpower to police all employee social media posts.

“Nobody in government can watch everything that’s being said about an entity in social media,” this person said. “What gets posted at 5 p.m. today will be buried under thousands of messages tomorrow.”

Gil Kerlikowske, who worked as CBP commissioner from 2014 until Trump took office in January 2017, led the agency during the period in 2016 when the images were allegedly reported to CBP. Kerlikowske said he didn't recall being alerted to the “10-15” group.

Kerlikowske also said he wasn’t familiar with any of the specific images from the group that were reportedly shared with CBP leaders in 2016. From their description, he said, they sounded like the type of incidents “you would probably handle at a more local level,” and that “especially the defecation thing seems kind of juvenile.”

The former commissioner added that while the majority of Border Patrol agents perform difficult work in a humane manner, “it’s still no excuse” for anyone to post offensive content.

The DHS inspector general’s office — the department’s internal watchdog — has launched an investigation into the recent Facebook posts, officials said Tuesday.

But given free speech protections granted civil servants, the anonymity that social media provides, and the participation of many government retirees, it wasn’t clear as of Wednesday that either the Trump administration or Facebook would be able to shut the Facebook group down or punish many of those who joined it.

A Facebook spokesperson said Tuesday the company is ""cooperating with federal authorities in their investigation"" into the 10-15 group, but it wasn’t clear whether the social network would take any enforcement action against its members or remove any of the posts.

Facebook prohibits an array of harmful content on its platforms, from criminal behavior to hate speech to posts inciting violence or harassing individuals. Several of the posts surfaced from the secretive Border Patrol group would appear to run afoul of those standards.

The post that depicts Ocasio-Cortez being forced to perform a sex act, for instance, seems likely to violate the company’s rules against violent and sexually suggestive content.

Others, in which officers talked about migrants in derogatory and dehumanizing terms, could break Facebook’s rules against hate speech. Facebook defines such speech as any “direct attack on people” based on identity markers such as race, ethnicity or national origin. The spokesperson said the company applies those standards “across Facebook, including in secret groups.”

In a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said the posts “appear to violate Facebook’s Community Standards,” particularly its ban on hate speech. Another House Democrat, Tech Accountability Caucus co-chair Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), told POLITICO, ""It is Facebook’s responsibility to ensure its platform — either publicly or in private messages— is not a refuge for hate.""

The company declined to comment on whether it will take any enforcement action against the group, its members, or their posts.

The government’s response, meanwhile is complicated by the distinct free speech protections granted federal employees, according to Shannon Farmer, an attorney who represents employers for the D.C.-based firm Ballard Spahr.

The government, she said, is obliged to protect federal employees’ right to address matters of public concern, and may punish them only if their speech interferes with the performance of their jobs.

“Typically, if people are expressing political views, that is considered to be protected speech,” Farmer said. However, law enforcement officers who use racist or derogatory language may give the impression they won’t be able to perform their job without bias. “You really need to look at the very specific language that they’re using,” she said.

The punishment for such offenses can range from counseling or a reprimand to termination, she said.

Border Patrol isn’t the only law enforcement agency to struggle with workers posting inflammatory remarks or images online. The Philadelphia Police Department in June reassigned 72 officers to desk duty following a review of social media posts.

“Every single law enforcement agency has a group like this,” said one former DHS official.

Both CBP and a union that represents Border Patrol agents have condemned the posts since they became public this week, and said they don’t represent the mentality of most agents.

Still, the posts rattled some former officials. “If you’re going to joke about dead Hispanic babies and raping members of Congress on Facebook in front of 9,500 of your colleagues,” another former DHS official said, “what are you saying and doing in private?”

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
"Justice Dept. Reverses Course on Citizenship Question on Census, Citing Trump’s Orders",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael Wines', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Alan Rappeport']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/politics/census-citizenship-question.html,"Looming over the latest disruptions was a July 1 deadline to begin printing 2020 census materials — a deadline that the Justice Department said could not be stretched without imperiling the schedule for the census itself.

Since Mr. Ross tacked the citizenship question onto the census in March 2018, long after other aspects of the questionnaire had been settled, the Census Bureau has been at the center of a ferocious partisan battle over the 2020 head count, its carefully tended reputation for trustworthiness and political impartiality all but shredded.

An army of critics, from cities and states to ethnic and civil-rights advocates, have argued that the question is an ill-disguised effort to skew the census’s results to the benefit of the Republican Party. That was only reinforced by the disclosure last month of a 2015 study by a Republican strategist, Thomas B. Hofeller, that explained how data from a citizenship question could be used to exclude noncitizens from the population bases used in redistricting. The newly drawn districts, he wrote, would tilt toward non-Hispanic whites and Republicans and hobble representation of Hispanics and Democrats.

Mr. Hofeller, who died last year, was the first person to urge Mr. Trump’s transition team in 2016 to add the question to the 2020 head count. Three separate federal courts — in New York, Maryland and California — have ruled that the Commerce Department violated federal procedural law and the Constitution in tacking the question onto the census. They called the department’s rationale — to improve enforcement of the Voting Rights Act — an obvious cover for some other motive.

On Wednesday, Judge Hazel ratcheted up the pressure on the administration to make up its mind, ordering the Trump administration either to confirm by Friday afternoon that it was not placing the citizenship question on the census questionnaire, or offer a schedule for continuing the Maryland lawsuit.

“Given that tomorrow is the Fourth of July and the difficulty of assembling people from all over the place, is it possible that we could do this on Monday?” Mr. Gardner asked."
Trump’s ‘natural law’ human rights panel readies for launch,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/03/human-rights-panel-1398636,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the panel's purpose in part will be to sort out “how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.” | Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images white house Trump’s ‘natural law’ human rights panel readies for launch The State Department initiative is seen as a potential counterweight to an expansive liberal view of human rights.

The Trump administration plans to officially launch a new panel on human rights as early as Monday — one already under scrutiny from Democrats who fear its stated focus on “natural law and natural rights” could undercut protections for women and LGBTQ people around the world.

State Department officials are briefing officials in Washington this week on the unveiling of the “Commission on Unalienable Rights,” a body with as many as 15 appointees who will offer advice on human rights policy to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. At least 10 of the people have been chosen so far, and their names are expected to be revealed at the launch, according to people familiar with the issue, who noted that the launch plans could still change.

The panel was conceived with almost no input from the State Department’s human rights bureau, people familiar with the matter say, effectively sidelining career government experts who have focused on human rights policy and history across numerous administrations.

“Congress has a responsibility to ensure the United States continues to stand as a principled bulwark in defense of human rights and the rule of law,” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. “That includes robust oversight to ensure this new commission is not used as another platform for the Trump administration to further erode U.S. leadership on human rights across the board.”

A State Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials say the panel is advisory and will not create policy, and maintain that everyone has “unalienable rights,” including LGBTQ people and other minorities.

In a notice posted in the Federal Register in May, the State Department said the panel “will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.”

The State Department has been relatively vague about the panel’s functions, insisting it will decide how to define terms like “natural law and natural rights.” Activists and lawmakers have been alarmed by that language, because both terms have been used in a variety of ways — from core foundations of modern philosophy to arguments used by some religious opponents of same-sex marriage.

They’ve also focused on the group’s expected focus on the “nation’s founding principles,” and whether it means the panel would ignore international human rights agreements hammered out over decades. The State Department has been telling people it’s briefed that the panel will at least consult one major international document — the 1948 U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The commission’s mission statement includes the “promotion of individual liberty, human equality and democracy through U.S. foreign policy,” according to people familiar with the issue.

Supporters of the Trump administration’s new panel say they hope it will reclaim the concept of human rights from groups that have taken it too far.

“Thanks to a growing emphasis on ‘economic and social rights’ — the banner under which many ‘social justice’ campaigners march — international human rights has become mired in social-policy goals and terminology,” Aaron Rhodes, president of the Forum for Religious Freedom-Europe, wrote in a Wall Street Journal column applauding the new panel last month.

“We’ve seen a proliferation, and consequent dilution, of human rights,” he added. “When human-rights advocates campaign for a ‘human right to sanitation,’ it diverts our attention from basic rights like freedom of speech or freedom from torture.”

In remarks to reporters in May after POLITICO first broke the story about the panel, Pompeo said the body’s purpose in part will be to sort out “how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

He added that although the panel is separate from State’s human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work. The secretary’s Policy Planning Staff, a group that functions as an in-house think tank, has been charged with setting up the commission.

The commission’s draft charter, first published by Just Security, says the panel will have no more than 15 members, meet once a month and cost roughly $385,000 a year to operate. Some lawmakers are already trying to use the appropriations process to prevent the commission from receiving any funding.

The secretary of State chooses the panel's members, who, the draft charter says, should have “distinguished backgrounds in U.S. diplomacy, international law and human rights.” The panel is supposed to be bipartisan, according to the draft charter, and its members do not appear to need Senate confirmation.

The draft charter doesn’t do much to clarify the panel’s mandate. “The commission’s charge is not to discover new principles, but to recover that which is enduring for the maintenance of free and open societies,” it states at one point.

The panel’s creation is notable in part because President Donald Trump has been trying to slash the size of the government. Just last month, he issued an executive order directing federal agencies to cut their number of advisory committees by a third.

The Trump administration typically uses human rights to whack adversaries, such as Iran and China, while generally avoiding it when dealing with allies and partners, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

One area in which the administration has put significant effort, however, is promoting religious freedom. That has included aiding minority Christians overseas — a move that has thrilled evangelicals in Trump's Republican base. But it has also included appeals for better treatment of Muslims and other faith groups, especially in countries such as China and Iran."

DOJ wants to replace interpreters with video explaining rights at first deportation hearings: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/latino/451649-doj-wants-to-replace-immigrants-interpreters-with-video-explaining-their-rights-at,"The Justice Department is reportedly planning to end the use of in-court interpreters for undocumented immigrants appearing at their first deportation hearings, where the migrants are informed of their rights and the schedules for their trials.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that under a new plan, immigrants would instead watch videotaped instructions that explain to defendants the scope of their rights and how their proceedings will be carried out in immigration courts.

Department of Justice (DOJ) officials reportedly informed the nation's immigration judges of the change last month. The videos are prerecorded in Spanish and a number of indigenous languages, the Chronicle reports, as many of those coming north from Central America are not native Spanish speakers.

An official with the agency told the Chronicle that the plan was “part of an effort to be good stewards of [DOJ's] limited resources.”

However, the head of a union representing immigration judges, who are DOJ employees, told the Chronicle that the plan would remove an ""integral"" part of the immigration court system.

“Interpreter cost is not a surprise cost — it’s an integral part of every case,” Ashley Tabaddor said, according to the newspaper.

""If they actually look at the courts as a real court, they would never be dismissive of the role of an interpreter. But the fact that we are here and have these budget shortfalls means they have prioritized the budget in a way that is dismissive of the integral role of the interpreters, and reflects the flaw of having the courts run by a law enforcement agency,"" she added.

""What if you have an individual that speaks an indigenous language and has no education and is completely illiterate?"" asked one judge, who remained anonymous in order to discuss the plan with the Chronicle.

""You think showing them a video is going to completely inform them of their rights? How are they supposed to ask questions of the judge?"" the judge reportedly added, calling the decision ""a disaster in the making."""
Obama DHS secretary says decriminalizing border crossings is 'open borders',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obama-dhs-secretary-says-decriminalizing-border-crossings-is-open-borders,"President Barack Obama's secretary of Homeland Security criticized the presidential Democratic candidates who have come out in support of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

Julián Castro, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has called for the repeal of Section 1325 in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, which makes it a misdemeanor for migrants to enter the United States illegally.

In his recently released immigration plan, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said he would ""virtually eliminate"" all immigrant detention centers.

""That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,"" Jeh Johnson told the Washington Post. ""That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that.""

Johnson has rebutted Democratic talking points when it comes to issues at the border. With renewed attention to the conditions and overcrowding at detention centers, he said those problems did not start when Donald Trump became president.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, okay?"" Jeh Johnson said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last week.

""But during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple — like four times — of what you’re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you’ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can't just dump 7-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso,"" he continued. ""And so these facilities were erected … they put those chain link partitions up so you could segregate young women from young men, kids from adults, until they were either released or transferred to HHS."""
State denies report ex-spokeswoman received Fox salary while in administration,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/451641-state-dept-denies-report-that-former-top-spokeswoman-received-fox,"The State Department on Wednesday said former spokeswoman Heather Nauert never received payments from 21st Century Fox during her two years in the Trump administration after a watchdog group alleged that Nauert had been paid by the media company while working as a government employee.

""The State Department’s Ethics Office confirms that Ms. Nauert’s certified Financial Disclosure Report did not contain salary from 21st Century Fox,"" a State Department spokesman said in a statement to The Hill on Wednesday.

The comments from the department came in response to a since-deleted report from watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) about the alleged salary payments that Nauert had received while working at the State Department.

The watchdog group, which has battled the administration on other issues, alleged that Nauert reported receiving a $167,000 salary from Fox in the second part of her termination report, which covered a period between January 2018 and March 2019.

But CREW late Wednesday night retracted its post, saying in a statement that an amended version of Nauert’s financial disclosure indicated she had not received payments from her former employer while in government.

“CREW’s post was written based on publicly available financial disclosure documents certified by Ms. Nauert,” the group said in a statement.

With the information provided in the new version, we have pulled the post down as it no longer reflects the information contained in the newest version of the report.”

Nauert, who worked as a top spokeswoman for the State Department between 2017 and 2019, blasted CREW's report on Twitter, calling it ""false"" and saying that its story was ""based on a preliminary draft with a clerical error.""

""The FINAL CERTIFIED report, available to anyone, makes it clear that I NEVER received salary from Fox,"" Nauert tweeted, adding in a separate tweet that the report was ""flat out wrong.""

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

How presidents through the years have celebrated July 4th,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-presidents-through-the-years-have-celebrated-july-4th/,"WASHINGTON — Through history, the Fourth of July has been a day for some presidents to declare their independence from the public. They've made tracks to the beach, the mountains, the golf course, the farm, the ranch. In the middle of the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was sailing to a Hawaii vacation.

It's also been a day for some presidents to insert themselves front and center in the fabric of it all, as Donald Trump plans to do Thursday with his speechifying and showmanship. Teddy Roosevelt drew crowds in the hundreds of thousands for his oratory and Richard Nixon enraged the anti-war masses without even showing up.

In modern times, though, presidents have tended to stand back and let the people party. George W. Bush had a ceremony welcoming immigrants as new citizens. Barack Obama threw a South Lawn barbecue for troops. Mr. Trump's plan to command center stage with his words and American military might has the capital cleaving along political lines.

As the anti-Nixon demonstrations of 1970 showed, Independence Day in the capital isn't always just fun and games. It has a tradition of red, white and boo, too.

And when protesters make their presence felt Thursday, that will be as American as the cherries and milk that apparently soured Zachary Taylor's gut when he wolfed them down July 4, 1850, and died five days later.

A look at what some presidents have done on the Fourth of July:

1777: On the first anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, with the Revolutionary War underway, future president John Adams describes a day and night of spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia in a letter to his wife, Abigail. After hours of parading troops, fireworks, bonfires and music, he tells her he strolled alone in the dark.

""I was walking about the streets for a little fresh air and exercise,"" he writes, ""and was surprised to find the whole city lighting up their candles at the windows. I walked most of the evening, and I think it was the most splendid illumination I ever saw; a few surly houses were dark; but the lights were very universal. Considering the lateness of the design and the suddenness of the execution, I was amazed at the universal joy and alacrity that was discovered, and at the brilliancy and splendour of every part of this joyful exhibition. ""

1791: Two years after becoming the first president, George Washington celebrates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, ""with an address, fine cuisine, and walking about town,"" says the National Park Service . Philadelphia was the interim capital as Washington, D.C., was being readied; Lancaster had hosted the Continental Congress for a quick, on-the-run session during the revolution.

1798: Now president, John Adams reviews a military parade in Philadelphia as the young nation flexes its muscle.

1801: Thomas Jefferson presides over the first Fourth of July public reception at the White House.

1822: James Monroe hangs out at his farm in Virginia.

1826: Adams, the second president, and Jefferson, the third, both die on this July 4.

1831: James Monroe, who was the fifth president, dies on this July 4.

1848: James Polk witnesses the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument with Abraham Lincoln, then an Illinois congressman, attending. A military parade follows.

1850: Zachary Taylor attends festivities at the grounds of the Washington Monument and falls ill with stomach cramps after eating cherries and drinking iced milk and water. He dies July 9. A theory that someone poisoned him with arsenic was debunked in 1991 when his body was exhumed and tested.

1861: Abraham Lincoln sends a message to Congress defending his invocation of war powers, appealing for more troops to fight the South and assailing Virginia for allowing ""this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders."" He vows to ""go forward without fear.""

1868: Post-war, Andrew Johnson executes a proclamation granting amnesty to those who fought for the Confederacy.

1902: Teddy Roosevelt speaks to 200,000 people in Pittsburgh. He liked to get in people's faces on the holiday.

1914: ""Our country, right or wrong,"" Woodrow Wilson declares at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

1928: Calvin Coolidge (born July 4, 1872) goes trout fishing in Wisconsin.

1930: Herbert Hoover vacations by the Rapidan River in Virginia.

1934: Franklin Roosevelt is in or near the Bahamas after leaving Annapolis, Maryland, on a monthlong voyage and visit to Hawaii via the Panama Canal. On July 4, the U.S.S. Houston's log refers to the ""fishing party"" leaving the ship for part of the day.

1946: With World War II over the year before, Harry Truman relaxes in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains at Roosevelt's Shangri-La retreat, later renamed Camp David.

1951: With the U.S. at war in Korea, Truman addresses a huge crowd at the Washington Monument grounds, marking the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

1953 and 1957: Dwight Eisenhower = golf.

1968: Lyndon Johnson, who favored his Texas ranch on the holiday, speaks in San Antonioabout the lack of independence for the poor, minorities, the ill, people ""who must breathe polluted air"" and those who live in fear of crime, ""despite our Fourth of July rhetoric.""

1970: Richard Nixon, in California, tapes a message that is played to crowds on the National Mall at an ""Honor America Day"" celebration organized by supporters and hotly protested by anti-war masses and civil rights activists. Tear gas overcomes protesters and celebrants alike, Viet Cong flags mingle with the Stars and Stripes, and demonstrators plunge into the reflecting pool, some naked.

1976: As the U.S. turns 200, Gerald Ford speaks at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, then Independence Hall, and reviews the armada of tall ships in New York harbor.

1987: Ronald Reagan, at Camp David, makes a straight political statement in his July 4 radio address, pitching an economic ""bill of rights"" and Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. On a Saturday, it served as his weekly radio address, which he and other modern presidents used for their agendas.

2008: George W. Bush, like several presidents before him, hosts a naturalization ceremony. More than 70 people from 30 countries are embraced as new citizens.

2010: Barack Obama brings 1,200 service members to the South Lawn for a barbecue. The father of a July 4 baby, Malia, he would joke that she always thought the capital fireworks were for her.

2012: Obama combines two Fourth of July traditions — celebrating troops and new citizens — by honoring the naturalization of U.S. military members who came to the country as immigrants.

2017: Mr. Trump goes to his golf club, then hosts a White House picnic for military families.

2018: Another White House picnic for military families, with thousands also invited to see the fireworks."
Justice Department inspector general to investigate FBI headquarters plans,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/justice-department-inspector-general-investigate-fbi-headquarters-plans/story?id=64109239,"The Justice Department inspector general plans to investigate the FBI's decision to scrap plans to relocate the agency's headquarters from downtown Washington, D.C., to the city's suburbs, according to a letter the agency watchdog sent to Congress earlier this week.

The agency watchdog will review the Justice Department and FBI's ""involvement in decisions relating to the possible relocation of FBI Headquarters,"" according to the letter the agency sent lawmakers on Tuesday.

Democrats have raised questions about the reversal of a move that was years in the making, and whether President Trump or the White House wielded improper influence over the decision that may have impacted his business interests. The current FBI headquarters is across the street from the Trump International Hotel in Washington.

Several Democrat-led House committees are investigating the decision to adjust plans for the FBI headquarters, which has also been investigated by the General Services Administration inspector general.

“For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions. We welcome the IG’s independent examination, which will supplement our ongoing effort to get to the truth,"" Reps. Elijah Cummings, Peter DeFazio - chairmen of the House Oversight and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees- Gerry Connolly and Dina Titus said in a statement.

Last year, a top General Services Administration official told the House Appropriations Committee the president had no role in the project, statements the GSA inspector general later said were misleading and “incomplete,” after it was revealed that the official, GSA Administrator Emily Murphy, attended two meetings at the White House, and one with the president, about the project.

The GSA inspector general also concluded the agency misrepresented the costs of the relocation plans, and found that the revised plan to renovate the existing facility would cost more than the plan to relocate the bureau to the suburbs."

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."

Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)

President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that an all-female delegation will attend the final match of the Women's World Cup this weekend in France to support the U.S. women's national team.

The seven-person delegation will travel to Lyon, France, for the final game Sunday. The U.S. women's national team advanced to the final match after beating England on Tuesday 2-1.

The White House said in a statement that the delegation will be led by Karen Dunn Kelley, the deputy secretary of commerce.

Other women traveling to France include Jamie McCourt, the U.S. ambassador to Monaco; Josephine Olsen, director of the Peace Corps; Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Marie Royce, assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs; Shauna Rohbock, a former professional soccer player and member of the Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition; and Kelly Loeffler, the CEO of Bakkt and co-owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream.

The announcement of the U.S. delegation comes amid a public spat between Trump and the co-captain of the U.S. team Megan Rapinoe. The player told the magazine Eight by Eight that she would not visit the White House if her team won and was invited.

""I'm not going to the f------ White House,"" Rapinoe said. ""No, I'm not going to the White House. We're not going to be invited. I doubt it.""

Trump responded, tweeting that Rapinoe should ""win before she talks! ""Finish the job!""

""We haven't yet invited Megan or the team, but I am inviting the TEAM, win or lose,"" Trump added. ""Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House or our flag."""
Commerce Dept. staff told to continue treating Huawei as blacklisted: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/451528-commerce-dept-staff-told-to-continue-treating-huawei-as-blacklisted-report,"A senior Commerce Department official reportedly told agency staff this week to continue treating Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei as blacklisted, after President Trump Donald John TrumpAn Independence Day wish for Hong Kong Hillary Clinton on July 4 event: Trump shouldn't need military next to him 'to show his patriotism' GOP lawmaker calls for Amash to leave Republican Conference MORE said he would allow U.S. companies to sell products to the company.

Reuters reported that John Sonderman, the deputy director of the Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement, wrote in an email to staff on Monday that Huawei remains ""on the Entity List” and application should be considered on merit.

""Evaluate the associated license review policy under part 744,” Sonderman wrote, according to Reuters, referring to regulations surrounding the entity list and a ""presumption of denial"" licensing policy for blacklisted companies.

Huawei was added to the department’s entity list in May, which is seen as a death sentence for included groups as U.S. companies are banned from doing business with them. The Commerce Department subsequently implemented a 90-day extension before Huawei would be added to the list to give U.S. companies time to adjust.

However, Trump seemed to walk back his administration’s crackdown on Huawei over the weekend while attending the Group of 20 summit in Japan, saying he would allow U.S. companies to sell products to Huawei. Trump noted that “we're talking about equipment where there’s no great national security problem with it.”

The president's announcement drew sharp bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers questioning whether the administration had given up a bargaining chip with China amid a long-running trade war. The announcement also left the status of Huawei on the entity list in question.

Larry Kudlow Lawrence (Larry) Alan KudlowMORE, the top White House economic adviser, on Sunday tried to cut down on the confusion around Huawei’s status.

Kudlow told CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" that “anything to do with national security concerns will not receive a new license from the Commerce Department. I think that’s very important. I think people have to understand that.”

The administration has been working with foreign allies over the past several months urging them to ban Huawei from their networks, with the U.S. arguing that Huawei is an arm of the Chinese government and a danger to U.S. data and intellectual property.

Huawei has been cautious in responding to the announcement, with a Huawei spokesperson telling The Hill earlier this week that “we acknowledge President Trump’s comments related to Huawei over the weekend and have nothing further to add at this time.”"
DOJ inspector general to investigate if Trump influenced decision on FBI headquarters,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-to-investigate-if-trump-influenced-decision-on-fbi-headquarters,"The Justice Department will investigate the decision-making process behind keeping the FBI headquarters at its current location amid allegations from Democrats that the White House influenced the choice to benefit President Trump financially.

The Trump administration contends FBI leadership made the decision not to build a new bureau headquarters in the D.C. suburbs.

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Tuesday the inquiry is in response to a May letter from Democratic House leaders.

“The review will include an examination of DOJ’s and FBI’s progress in its planning, their assessment and consideration of the previously proposed plan to move FBI Headquarters to a suburban location, and their assessment of the plan to demolish the J. Edgar Hoover Building and construct a new facility on that site,” Horowitz wrote.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Peter DeFazio of Oregon were joined by Reps. Gerald Connolly of Virginia and Dina Titus of Nevada, and the four claimed the decision to keep the FBI headquarters in D.C., rather than following a plan to move the bureau’s headquarters to the suburbs in Maryland or Virginia that had been decades in the making, was motivated by Trump’s financial interests.

“The Trump Administration's abrupt decision to abandon the long-standing relocation plan is of concern in light of the fact that many years before becoming President, Donald Trump expressed interest in the FBI headquarters moving out of Washington, D.C., so he could acquire the land on Pennsylvania Avenue and redevelop the property, which is directly across the street from the Trump International Hotel,” the House Democrats wrote. “However, after he was sworn in as President and became ineligible as a federal employee to obtain the property-he reportedly became ‘dead opposed’ to the government selling the property, which would have allowed commercial developers to compete directly with the Trump Hotel.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray insisted it was “absolutely the FBI’s view, the FBI’s choice, the FBI’s preference to build a new building at our current location” and not because of political pressure while testifying in front of a House committee in April.

“I took a very long, careful, thorough look, and it is the FBI’s view that the best balance of equities for the men and women of the FBI is to be here, downtown, ideally in our current location,” Wray said.

Wray said building in the same location rather than moving the bureau would help “make sure that our folks are within close proximity for the hundreds and hundreds of meetings that they have every day with their partners all within about a mile and a half of our current location.”

Wray also said keeping the FBI building in the heart of D.C. would also be “the best choice for the American people as well” because of the thousands of tourists who visit the FBI each day.

The inspector general of the General Services Administration, which manages federal buildings, released a report highlighting a number of meetings in 2017 and 2018 between top DOJ and FBI officials — including then-Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein and Wray — and White House officials about this issue, including a meeting in the Oval Office with Trump.

The GSA inspector general also scrutinized GSA Administrator Emily Murphy’s meetings with White House officials and Trump. Murphy had testified to Congress about the GSA’s plans for the FBI building, and the watchdog claimed it “found that Murphy’s congressional testimony was incomplete and may have left the misleading impression that she had no discussions with White House officials in the decision-making process about the project.”

Murphy insisted in congressional testimony in March that Wray decided not to move the FBI.

“I stand by my testimony that the senior leadership of the FBI made the decision to remain at the current Pennsylvania Avenue location,” he said.

But Cummings, DeFazio, Connolly, and Titus continue to claim that ""the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress"" and that ""we have been left with many unanswered questions.”

Washington – President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China and Europe of playing a “big currency manipulation game.” He said the United States should match that effort, a move that directly contradicts official U.S. policy not to manipulate the dollar’s value to gain trade advantages.

In a tweet, the president said if America doesn’t act, the country will continue “being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for so many years.”

Trump’s own Treasury Department in May found that no country meets the criteria of being labeled a currency manipulator, although the report did put China and eight other countries on a watch list.

A country manipulates its currency when it drives down the value to make its exports cheaper and foreign imports more expensive.

As a candidate in 2016, Trump repeatedly charged that China was manipulating its currency and as president he would immediately label China as a currency manipulator.

However, after taking office, Trump’s Treasury Department has issued five reports on the subject, required by law every six months. In each report it said no country met the criteria to be labeled a currency manipulator.

Trump’s tweet seemed to have no impact in currency markets, a situation that would likely change if Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began threatening to use currency manipulation to drive down the dollar’s value.

The Treasury secretary has the job of commenting on the dollar’s value and also implementing intervention to buy or sell dollars in currency markets to influence the dollar’s value. U.S. administrations for decades have pledged in international communiques not to intervene in currency markets for the purpose of influencing trade flows.

A weaker dollar would boost U.S. exports but could run the risk of causing foreign investors who are helping to finance the federal government’s $22 trillion national debt to move their investments elsewhere to avoid the risk of currency depreciation lowering their returns.

EPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451618-epa-moving-ahead-with-plan-to-phase-out-animal-testing-report,"The Intercept reported Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is looking to push ahead with a plan to phase out animal lab testing, which is raising concerns among some public health and environmental advocates who say the testing is needed to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals.

EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report EPA's backward accounting protects polluters, not the people Overnight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project MORE signaled the agency will slash funding on experiments tested on mammals in half by 2025 and look to stop using mammal studies for the approval of new chemicals by 2035, in an internal department memo reviewed by The Intercept.

The EPA, however, is denying The Intercept's report that it is looking to phase out animal testing, calling it inaccurate. It did acknowledge it is seeking to reduce and replace animal testing requirements.

""Though, EPA does look to announce sometime soon agency goals to reduce the number of animals impacted by EPA testing. Human health will be fully protected under any final EPA policy goal to reduce reliance on animal testing,"" an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""EPA can protect human health and simultaneously reduce, replace, and refine animal testing requirements.""

According to The Intercept, the EPA is looking to use alternative methods to animal testing, such as computer modeling and tests on cells, to measure chemical toxicity.

However, scientists warn that the alternatives are not yet able to replicate mammal studies for regulation — which many say is the reason the federal agency is looking to make the policy change, The Intercept reports.

""EPA is well aware that these cells don’t replicate human metabolism. So when it comes to bioactivation, they’re going to miss all that — and they know that,"" Thomas Zoeller, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the health effects of man-made chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls, told The Intercept."
Making Sense of the USDA’s Planted Acres Report,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/successful-marketing/making-sense-of-the-usdas-planted-acres-report,"The USDA report last week was one of the better curveballs we have seen in the past few years. Traders were expecting to see corn acres near 86.6 million. The USDA reported corn acres at 91.7 million acres. How could this be close at all?

Well, the USDA did say that the 91.7 was acres planted and intended to plant. So, the report last week felt more like a combination of the March planting intentions report and the June planted acreage report. The extremely wet spring was noted as reason the USDA will resurvey planted acres. Those results will be announced in the August 12 monthly supply and demand report.

Corn prices had a wild few minutes just after the crop report was released last Friday. Prices had a 31¢ range in the first five minutes. The bearishness of the acres was enough that corn actually traded limit down for a short time.

The holiday-shortened week was slightly concerning for many traders as they were expecting light volume. The bears could have easily pushed prices through support, however, that did not happen. December corn futures have managed to hold major support so far. Read the Successful Marketing Newsletter to see where those support levels sit."

Franklin, 73, grew up on Long Island, New York, and spent his summers on nearby Fire Island working at the illustrious Talisman Yacht Club, home to the jet set of the 1960s. There he learned the ins and outs of the food and beverage service industry and how to interact with the rich and famous, including Marilyn Monroe, who rented a house just a few doors down from Franklin.

Franklin didn't know it, but his experience on Fire Island and at the yacht club helped prepare him to later serve some of the most powerful men in the world.

Franklin was drafted for the Vietnam War shortly after graduating high school and decided to join the Air Force because ""it was the only branch of the military where the enlisted men weren't the primary resource being shot — instead they went for the officers,"" he said.

Franklin — who currently serves as the director of Cape Fear Regional Jetport, North Carolina's fourth busiest airport — shared his stories Wednesday at the Naples Airport Authority's 50th anniversary party.

His first assignment was working in a mess hall near missile bases in South Dakota. Franklin then became a member of an in-flight B-52 kitchen crew based in Guam and eventually made his way to Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., as a member of the 89th Airlift Wing, the unit that operates Air Force One.

When Franklin was promoted to the crew of Air Force One in 1976, it was toward the end of Gerald Ford's administration, and he was told he might not have a job in six months when a new president took office.

However, not only did Franklin serve Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, he remained on the flight crew during the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, making Franklin the first and only Air Force One flight attendant to serve five consecutive presidents.

""I was in the right place at the right time and I was capable, mentally and physically, of doing what they needed me to do,"" he said.

One of Franklin's major responsibilities was planning and grocery shopping for all of the meals served aboard Air Force One. It was a job that was part-culinary, part-security because it was up to him to ensure that none of the food was poisoned.

""The flight attendants would shop in civilian clothes because we didn't want anybody to know who we were, and we would never go to the same store,"" Franklin said. ""Our primary responsibility was not only to give good service, but to make sure the food and anything on that airplane — drinks, snacks, candy, mouthwash, toothpaste, whatever — had not been tampered with.""

Franklin served on Air Force One for a total of 18 years. He got to know everything about the presidents, from their favorite food (there was always a fresh jar of jelly beans for Reagan, and Bush had an affinity for pork rinds) to their preferred type of music (country for all except Clinton, who was ""a rock 'n roll guy""), Franklin said.

""Presidents are just like us; they cry, they feel, they hurt,"" he said. ""They get up in the morning, put their pants on in the morning and go to work.""

Sometimes, though, they need a little help getting up. Franklin recalled one trip when he had to wake up President Clinton after just two and a half hours of sleep. He tried to wake the president gently, but after a while he said bluntly, ""Sir, it's time to get your butt out of bed and go to work,"" Franklin said.

""He's the only guy I would have said that to,"" Franklin said with a laugh. ""Hillary thought it was hilarious and started laughing, so I turned to her and said, 'What are you laughing at? You're next!'""

The stories enthralled guests at the airport party.

Christopher Rozansky, Naples Airport Authority executive director, said the anniversary is a historic milestone for the airport, which is updating its master plan for the first time in 20 years.

""So often we focus on the work that needs to be done that we don't take the time to reflect on where we've come from or the accomplishments we've achieved,"" Rozansky said.

Some of those accomplishments include ushering in 150,000 visitors each year and boasting an economic impact of $440.1 million, according to a Florida Department of Transportation report released this year.

Rozansky said the Airport Authority plans on celebrating its 50th anniversary with events throughout the rest of the year, including an appreciation party for airport customers and an inaugural 5K on the runway Oct. 5 to benefit the Experimental Aircraft Association's youth program.

""Our mission is to connect people in Naples,"" he said, ""and as more and more people move to Southwest Florida, that mission is more important than ever.""

This new tool cuts VA disability claims’ processing time in half,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/digital-va-disability-claims-tool-form-526ez/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

Veterans looking to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities can now use a self-service online tool developed by the U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The new tool, built in partnership by the digital team (DSVA), the VA’s Office of Information Technology and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), aims to make it easier for veterans to submit disability claims to the agency. And it comes with a side benefit for all involved: It’s reportedly decreasing the overall adjudication times for claims.

The Disability Compensation Claim Tool is a new digital front end for the form 526EZ, a deeply bureaucratic 12-page document that begins with seven pages of instructions. In it, veterans are called upon to describe their service-connected injuries neatly and in a small table — a process that can be as taxing as it is confusing.

The new digital version is designed such that veterans can “get through the process easily and understand what’s happening,” Andrea Schneider, product lead at DSVA, told FedScoop in an interview. It’s not just an online version of the old paper form — it’s a revamped experience that guides veterans through the process, asking user-friendly questions and using the answers to populate a regular 526EZ on the backend. In a sense, the tool works to translate the kind of plain language a veteran would use into the bureaucratic officialese that claims adjudicators require.

“We don’t need the veteran to be an expert in our administrative processes,” Paul Shute, chief of operational innovation at the VBA’s Compensation Service, told FedScoop.

As always, DSVA emphasized user-centered design in building the tool, talking with “hundreds” of veterans to unveil their needs and testing an early version of the tool beginning in August 2018, the team said. The final version, which fully launched in March, is the culmination of about two years of “solid, dedicated effort,” Schneider told FedScoop.

“It’s been a labor of love,” she added.

But the tool isn’t just easier — it’s also faster. Before launch, the average disability claims processing time was somewhere between 108 and 120 days (FedScoop got differing feedback on this). The majority of that time, Shute told FedScoop, was spent gathering evidence — often in a back-and-forth between the veteran and the adjudicator. The new tool’s use of conditional logic and data integration has already managed, on average, to cut that time in half, the team said. Since March, there have been more than 10,000 claims submissions sent through the tool.

“It’s been an incredible project,” Schneider said. “It’s been impactful from a service perspective, feeling like we’re really able to touch people’s lives and make them a little bit better.”

The new tool is the latest in the VA’s continued focus on putting its veteran “customers” first. In November 2018 the agency launched a new version of VA.gov, one that puts veteran service front and center. And in May the agency officially added customer experience to its “Core Values and Characteristics” — the guidelines in the the Code of Federal Regulations that define priorities of VA employees as well as what the agency stands for.

“We depend on Veterans, their caregivers, and our business partners to help us form the vision of an improved Veteran experience,” James Gfrerer, CIO at the VA, said in a statement emailed to FedScoop. “Human-centered design, powered by IT, is transforming VA.”"

Brazilian-Owned JBS Is Big Winner in USDA Pork Contracts,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/livestock/hogs/brazilian-owned-jbs-is-big-winner-in-usda-pork-contracts,"[Updated to include a response from the USDA at the bottom.]

A Brazilian-owned meat processing company undercut its competition by more than $1 per pound to win nearly $78 million in pork contracts through a federal program launched to help American farmers offset the impact from an ongoing trade war.

As a result, JBS USA has won more than 26% of the $300 million the USDA has allocated to pork so far – more than any other company, according to an analysis of bid awards by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The USDA’s Trade Mitigation Program was announced last August, and included direct payments to farmers, as well as $1.2 billion in food purchases from farmers and ranchers whose crops normally benefit from international markets. The plan called for $558 million worth of pork purchases. The program is intended to help U.S. farmers and ranchers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes with China, Mexico, Canada, and other trading partners.

JBS bid an average of $2.56 per pound for 5-pound pork loin cuts, while its competitors bid an average of $3.80 per pound. The company bid as low as $2.02 for the cut, the Midwest Center found.

The analysis found that JBS bid 33% less on the contracts – undercutting its competitors, even Tyson Foods, the second-largest meat processor in the country.

JBS USA is the U.S. division of JBS SA, the world’s largest meat producer. The company owns more than 300 live hog operations in the United States.

It’s expanded its reach in the U.S. in the last decade, buying Swift & Co., Smithfield Beef Group, Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride poultry, and Cargill’s Pork business, in addition to other acquisitions abroad.

JBS’ facilities in Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and California have won trade mitigation contracts with the USDA.

“Who’s the government going to purchase it from? The Brazilian-owned JBS or the Chinese-owned Smithfield? They’ve allowed enough concentration in the packing industry, you’re running out of choices,” said Brian Duncan, a hog farmer from northwest Illinois and vice president of the Illinois Farm Bureau.

Duncan raises 70,000 hogs each year, selling mostly to Tyson, but also to JBS’ Beardstown, Illinois, facility.

Greg Gunthorp, who raises hogs near Mongo, Indiana, said its JBS’ size that allows it to offer such low prices.

“They’re a huge global corporation,” he said. Because of that, they are less impacted by the demand problems purely American pork processors are facing. “To claim we’re bailing out the farmer and bailing out agriculture, and giving it to foreign multinational corporations is a joke.”

In an emailed statement, JBS stressed its American roots.

“We operate U.S. pork plants, processing American hogs raised by U.S. farmers – the true program beneficiaries,” said Nikki Richardson, a spokesperson for JBS USA. “Like other companies in the program, our sole intent for participating was to support U.S. producer prices and help our American producer partners. It was not a bailout.”

Little impact for U.S. farmers

The pork JBS is selling to the federal government comes from American farmers, the company said. JBS said its facilities in Worthington, Minnesota; Marshalltown, Iowa;, Ottumwa, Iowa; and Beardstown, Illinois work with more than 3,165 pork producers, paying $3.5 billion in livestock payments each year.

But many of those producers are on long-term pricing contracts with JBS and may not see much benefit from the USDA’s purchases.

“How does that trickle down to farmers raising pigs for them?” asked Gunthorp. “They’re on a contract. That contract’s not changing because JBS sold more pork to the government.”

Duncan said he hasn’t seen much uptick in prices because of the trade dispute commodity purchases.

“There was a slight run-up in price late last fall,” he said. “There was a rally and the rumor was the government was making some purchases.”

The first USDA awards for pork products were released in November. But Duncan said a bigger factor affecting hog prices has been the African swine fever that’s been hurting hog farmers in China and Southeast Asia since last August.

China’s hog population has dropped by 40 million.

The U.S. produces 74.3 million hogs annually, according to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service.

The disease has increased global demand for pork and could be an opportunity to sell more U.S. pork to Asian markets. But that depends on trade with China reopening.

“There’s opportunity there for us to be a major supplier,” said Duncan. “But I don’t know if this administration is going to let us take advantage of that opportunity.”

The USDA’s purchases represent such a small portion of U.S. hog production, it’s unclear they’ll make much difference.

Ted Schroeder, an agriculture economist at Kansas State University, said many of the impacted markets will barely notice these purchases.

“I just don’t see these programs being huge support for farmers,” said Scheoder.

While pork makes up nearly half the food to be purchased through the USDA trade mitigation program, it’s small in comparison with the amount of pork produced each year, Schroeder said.

“Once completed, it will have resulted in moving a week’s worth of U.S. pork production, which is significant during a challenging time,” said Jim Monroe, senior communications director for the National Pork Producers Council, referring to the first round of pork purchases. “Our preference is an end to trade disputes that have prompted retaliatory tariffs against U.S. pork from two of our largest export markets, Mexico and China.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has bought $748 million worth of food from farmers and ranchers, nearly two thirds of the original $1.2 billion goal according to the Midwest Center analysis.

That’s five times as much on food as the agency bought in the first six months of the program, according to analysis by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The program was intended to be temporary relief for farmers struggling against the effects of the trade wars. On May 13 President Trump announced the USDA would buy another $1.3 billion in food from U.S. producers.

An agency spokesperson said in an email that the first round of commodity purchases won’t be completed until January 2020. The USDA has yet to give details on the second round of purchases.

JBS is under scrutiny by several U.S. senators who say the company shouldn’t be able to participate in the USDA program.

“It is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration’s trade policy,” said the May 29 letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, from nine U.S. senators.

Following publication of this story, the USDA provided a response from Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue:

""We’re buying U.S. produced agricultural products. The premise behind procurement is to take product off the market and support prices. This will help U.S. Farmers,” said Perdue. “These are legal companies operating in the United States. This is no different than people buying Volkswagens or other foreign autos that are manufactured in the United States, where their executives may have been guilty of some issue along the way. They still buy the cars. JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers. What we do through these companies – it’s not to help the companies – they offer a bid to us based on buying U.S. farmers production. This helps U.S. Farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.”

Naig says his department will work with Cedar Rapids, Cedar Falls, Waterloo and agriculture groups to design and implement the wetland areas. The areas will be seeded with pollinator-friendly plants to attract bees, butterflies and other pollinator species in addition to providing a filtering mechanism for nitrogen that comes from fertilizer placed on cornfields.

Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.
