Rubio hits back at NYT reporter who called him out for ‘smiling’ at Trump rally,https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-hits-back-at-nyt-reporter-saying-its-very-strange-hes-smiling-at-trump-re-election-rally,"Don't let a reporter from the Gray Lady catch you smiling at a Trump rally.

Senator Marco Rubio hit back at a New York Times reporter after the writer tweeted that it was “very strange” to see the Florida senator “smiling and chuckling” at the president’s re-election rally in Orlando Tuesday evening.

“BREAKING,” Rubio tweeted mockingly in response to Michael Barbaro. “In an unprecedented move a Republican Senator attended a rally in his home state in support of the re-election of a Republican President.”

In another tweet directed at Barbaro, he aligned himself with several of the president’s policies. “As opposed to smiling & chuckling at a rally for a radical liberal candidate for President who will undo policies to confront China, reduce regulations & taxes, defend liberty in Venezuela & protect the unborn?” he asked rhetorically.

Rubio also called out Barbaro, writing that after weeks of covering him in 2015, the reporter “uncovered that my wife had traffic tickets, I had a fishing boat & my home has big windows.”

Tensions between Rubio and Trump were high in the midst of the 2016 Republican primary when Rubio called Trump the man “with the worst spray tan in America” and joked with a rally crowd that then-candidate Trump may have wet his pants during a debate and had small hands.

Trump dubbed him “Little Marco,” said the senator “choked like a dog"" during a debate and “couldn’t get elected dog catcher"" in Florida. Rubio dropped out of the race after he lost his home state to Trump by double digits."
"The Evangelical, the ‘Pool Boy,’ the Comedian and Michael Cohen",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Frances Robles', 'Jim Rutenberg']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/trump-falwell-endorsement-michael-cohen.html,"That attempt, Mr. Cohen says on the recording, came months before he brought Mr. Falwell “to the table” for Mr. Trump. Until then, he adds, “none of the evangelicals wanted to support Trump.”

There is no evidence that Mr. Falwell’s endorsement was part of a quid pro quo arranged by Mr. Cohen. Indeed, the relationship, if any, between the endorsement and the photo episode remains unclear. But the new details — some of which have been reported by news outlets including BuzzFeed and Reuters over the last year — show how deeply Mr. Falwell was enmeshed in Mr. Cohen’s and Mr. Trump’s world.

And they add another layer to one of the enduring curiosities of the Trump era: the support the president has received from evangelical Christians, who have traditionally demanded that their political leaders exhibit “family values” and moral “character.” Mr. Falwell’s father forged those words into weapons against the Democrats after he co-founded the Moral Majority political movement, which propelled Ronald Reagan into the White House and made religious conservatives a vital constituency for any Republican who would be president.

By the time Republicans cast their first votes in 2016, Mr. Trump was starting to show surprising strength among some white evangelicals. But with Mr. Falwell serving as the torchbearer of his father’s legacy, his endorsement became a permission slip for deeply religious conservatives who were attracted by Mr. Trump’s promises to make America great again but wary of his well-known history of infidelity, his previous support of abortion rights and his admission that he had never asked for God’s forgiveness.

“For those of the more fundamentalist variant of evangelicalism, the Falwell family, and the Falwell endorsements, are an important factor,” said Jim Guth, a political-science professor at Furman University who has long studied evangelical politics. Mr. Cruz still managed to win in Iowa. But Mr. Trump soon won South Carolina with strong evangelical support, sending him on a solid path toward the nomination.

Three years later, Mr. Falwell remains an unwavering Trump supporter. Last month he went so far as to suggest that the president deserved an extended term as “reparations” for time lost to the Mueller investigation. In turn, he has had entree to the White House, providing input on education policies that stand to benefit Liberty."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-don-lemon-compares-trump-to-hitler-maybe-we-shouldnt-give-bad-people-a-platform,"CNN anchor Don Lemon made what he himself described as a ""extreme"" comparison between President Trump and Adolf Hitler while arguing that such ""bad people"" shouldn't be given a platform.

During their nightly hand-off, his primetime colleague Chris Cuomo began by describing 2020 as the most ""definitional"" election in his lifetime. Lemon appeared to attempt to shame Trump supporters, and asked them if they will ""continue to fall for the o-ke-doke."" But then he questioned the media's responsibilities in covering Trump's candidacy.

The ""CNN Tonight"" anchor urged Cuomo to ""think about the most despicable people in history"" and warned him that he was going to use an ""extreme example.""

""Think about Hitler. Think about any of those people... if you could look back in history, would you say, 'Well, I'm so glad that person was allowed a platform so that they could spread their hate and propaganda and lies,' or would you say, 'That probably wasn't the right thing to do to spread that because you knew in that moment that was a bad person and they were doing bad things. And not only were they hurting people, they were killing people.""

""I think that the example matters,"" Cuomo responded. ""And that's a very extreme example.""

""Listen, for people like me, how this the president feels about the Central Park Five, that could be a life or death issue for people like me,"" Lemon doubled down. ""He took a big part of their life away... and demonizing immigrants and talking about 'sh**hole countries' and saying that 'there were very fine people on both sides.' For people of color in this country, it is a life or death issue... so I'm just saying we just need to be careful about having 'these are standard rules.' This is not standard. This is not normal.""

""Comparing anything to an extreme like a Hitler- it weakens the argument,"" Cuomo pushed back, ""because you are now taking a guy who says things you don't like and comparing him to a genocidal maniac.""

""I'm not comparing him to that,"" Lemon attempted to clarify. ""I'm comparing the way you would cover someone who is a bad person who does bad things."""
Opinion | The Wave That Could Carry Trump to Re-election,https://www.nytimes.com,['Matthew Continetti'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/opinion/trump-2020-campaign.html,"Circumstances might change, of course. The flare-up with Iran and mixed signals from the bond market remind us that our political future isn’t a straight-line projection of the present. But Mr. Trump is wary of foreign entanglements, and a slowdown is not the same as a recession. Sustained peace and prosperity improve Mr. Trump’s chances of a second term.

So does the continuing revolt against global elites. One of the many oddities of this presidency is that a uniquely American figure such as Mr. Trump is part of a worldwide phenomenon. But there really can be no doubt that Mr. Trump was among the first heralds of an anti-elitist turn that has disrupted politics from London to Melbourne. The issues animating this upheaval have not disappeared. Nor is Mr. Trump likely to.

Brexit, Election Day 2016, the collapse of the center-left in France, Germany and Italy, the so-called yellow vest protests, the losses by centrist parties in the recent European elections and a political upset in Australia have been categorized as examples of “populism” or “nationalism.” They are labeled a reaction against “globalization.” But these grand terms mask as much as they reveal. And they sometimes are used to play down or dismiss political activity that an analyst finds uncouth, retrograde or offensive.

It helps to be more specific. Behind the rise of outsider politicians such as Mr. Trump are the interrelated issues of unchecked immigration, terrorism and the imposition of carbon taxes and other measures to mitigate climate change. Elites’ inability or lack of interest in tackling these problems — or even seeing them as problems — generates a crisis of representation in which large numbers of voters look for alternatives they cannot find within traditional political structures. The results have been unexpected.

The furor surrounding the arrival of unaccompanied children on America’s southern border in 2014 was a harbinger. President Barack Obama’s expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, following his party’s shellacking in the midterm elections that November further polarized a disenchanted Republican electorate. The next summer Mr. Trump opened his presidential candidacy with inflammatory remarks about illegal immigration. And Angela Merkel announced, “We can do this” during a visit to a migrant camp in Dresden, Germany. The willingness and capacity of electorates to absorb large numbers of newcomers would be on the ballot. The answer was not what leaders had in mind."
House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
"Trump Admin Hid Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan’s Dark Past, Senators Say",https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin-Banco Sam-Brodey Lachlan-Markay Noah-Shachtman', 'Erin Banco', 'Sam Brodey', 'Lachlan Markay', 'Noah Shachtman', 'National Security Reporter', 'Congressional Reporter']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-hid-acting-secretary-of-defense-patrick-shanahans-dark-past-senators-say,"The senators tasked with vetting Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan say they were unaware of the accusations of domestic violence in his family that led to his resignation Tuesday. The altercations never came up during Shanahan’s 2017 confirmation hearing for the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense, lawmakers told The Daily Beast, nor did it arise as he was preparing to assume the role of Pentagon chief permanently.

“We’ve been wondering why we have not gotten an FBI report. It has seemed slow to us. And now we understand why,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that he “didn’t know” about Shanahan's ex-wife’s arrest for punching Shanahan in the face, nor his son’s arrest for attacking his mother with a baseball bat, until reports surfaced in USA Today and the Washington Post about the alleged incidents.

President Donald Trump nominated Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, for defense secretary in March 2019. Since then, his confirmation process lingered, leaving the Pentagon without a confirmed leader for the longest stretch in history and raising concerns among lawmakers who were told that the postponement was partly because of a hold up by the FBI. At least one of those lawmakers called for an investigation on Tuesday as to why they had not been told by the administration about Shanahan’s past.

“I want to know what was known, and whether it was fully disclosed,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who also sits on the armed services committee, told The Daily Beast. “It was material to this nomination when he was proposed for deputy secretary, as well as named his nominee as secretary, although the full paperwork was never sent to us.”

The administration is supposed to turn over all relevant docs pertaining to a nominee’s background check. But that didn’t happen, according to a former Senate Armed Services Committee staffer.

“This never came up the first time around [when Shanahan was nominated to be Deputy Defense Secretary in 2017]. Trust me, I’d remember. And the FBI vetting process is thorough. We would routinely get things like a nominee who had tried coke once in the 1980s,” the ex-staffer told The Daily Beast.

“If these domestic issues are as serious as being reported, SASC would have been told,” the ex-staffer added. “And I would know. Which leads me to conclude that this stuff was never reported to the committee. Not sure why that happened, but I see no other explanation.”

Shanahan announced Tuesday that he would no longer seek to be confirmed as Defense Secretary and would be resigning from his post at the Pentagon. The news came as reports surfaced that he had downplayed his son’s assault on his ex-wife, and that both he and his ex-wife had both claimed, back in 2010, that they had been punched in the face by the other after drinking. Part of the altercation reportedly took place in front of their home in Seattle. USA Today obtained recordings from the night of the incident.

“My husband is throwing punches at me,” Shanahan’s ex-wife Kimberly Jordinson told a 911 offcer, according to USA Today. “He’s been hitting me… I don’t need a medic, I need you guys to get him out of the house… He’s just swinging punches at me.”

Shanahan maintains that he never “laid a hand on” his former wife.

“After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way,” Shanahan said in a statement Tuesday. “I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life.”

In the case of high level appointees like secretary of defense, FBI investigators are able to marshal more resources for a more detailed background check than most civil servants would normally get. “They do up to about 40 face-to-face interviews,” said John Berry, an attorney who represents clients in security clearance cases, said. “A normal person with a top secret clearance, they may come and talk to like five or ten folks.”

Attorneys say that, absent any more revelations about Shanahan, the domestic violence allegations against his wife and son would probably not have stopped most applicants from getting a clearance, assuming investigators knew about them.

“The reason this probably slipped through is because, as far as I can tell, Shanahan was never charged with anything. So nothing would’ve popped up in a national criminal database check,” said Brad Moss, a national security lawyer with extensive experience handling clearance cases.

Shanahan’s resignation comes at a particularly fraught time for the Defense Department. Officials there are in the midst of dealing with increasing escalations with Tehran, and on Monday the administration announced that it was prepared to send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East to counter Iran’s presence in the region. Amid the absence of a confirmed secretary, the State Department has lead the way on Iran policy, crafting the maximum pressure campaign along with Treasury that’s led to more than a thousand sanctions designations against the country. State has also held briefings with Congress about Iran over the last several weeks.

While Tuesday’s revelations caught many lawmakers by surprise, others said they had been made aware of them before they were reported publicly.

“I know he’s been accused of things for a long time… he also is, keep in mind, he went to confirmation as the deputy. So that’s a process,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A senior White House official told The Daily Beast that Shanahan’s withdrawal has been expected for “a couple weeks” in light of the incidents, reports of which had been circulating internally.

“One concern was it would turn into another Kavanaugh situation,” the official said, referring to the highly contentious confirmation fight over the Supreme Court Justice. The White House anticipated that Senate Democrats might seize on reports of domestic problems in Shanahan’s home to attempt to tie him to the larger problem of domestic violence in the military.

Of particular concern, the White House official said, was Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, Democratic presidential candidate, and longtime critic of the Pentagon’s handling of sexual assault and abuse cases against female service members. Though not directly analogous to the litany of documented cases of such assaults, reports about Shanahan’s private life, the White House worried, might hand Gillibrand and like-minded committee Democrats a cudgel to wield against Shanahan’s nomination.

Shanahan’s replacement, Mark Esper, is currently the secretary of the Army and has a long history of working in top positions in the military and with government contractors, including Raytheon. Those who’ve known Esper over the years say he has the attitude of an entrenched bureaucrat who is eager to please his bosses.

“He was one of the top five guys in our class and he is highly regarded in the Trump administration,” said one former senior Pentagon official who attended school with Esper. Esper was also a classmate of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986.

“He is very good at figuring out what his superior wants and he delivers,” the former official said. “And Mark’s approach to his work is to focus on the core mission in front of him—to prevail against the U.S.’s competitors. And he knows in this case those rivals are Russia and China.”

William Barr’s Justice Department Is Now Openly Running Legal Interference for Paul Manafort,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/paul-manafort-william-barr-new-york-prison.html,"President Donald Trump listens to Attorney General William Barr during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on May 22 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has decided to run interference for Paul Manafort, protecting him from harsh imprisonment and even questioning the validity of charges brought against him by state prosecutors. This effort to aid the president’s loyal associate behind bars is a startling escalation of Attorney General William Barr’s campaign to help Trump and his confederates evade consequences for their misdeeds.

Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2018 then pleaded guilty to illegal foreign lobbying and witness tampering. He was first prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who secured a 7.5-year federal prison sentence earlier this year. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance then brought 16 additional charges under New York law. Manafort is currently housed in Loretto, a federal prison in southwest Pennsylvania, and Vance’s office requested his transfer to a New York facility. (Typically, federal prisoners awaiting trial in New York state court are held in the notoriously brutal Rikers Island jail.)

In May, Manafort attorney Todd Blanche wrote a letter to Vicky Moser, Loretto’s warden, protesting this transfer. Blanche asked that Manafort be allowed to remain in Loretto to address his “health challenges” and preserve his “reasonable access to counsel.” And Blanche had another reason his client deserved special treatment: Manafort, Blanche alleged, “is being prosecuted in New York for exactly the same conduct for which he has already been tried and sentenced” in federal court. The New York prosecution thus “appears to be a blatant violation” of the state’s “long-standing and highly protective” double jeopardy laws. Condemning Vance’s actions as “politics at its worst,” Blanche declared that Vance is “attempting to add insult to injury” by placing his client on Rikers Island. In other words, Manafort should not be moved to New York because the New York charges against him are invalid.

By itself, this letter would be unremarkable, a plea from his top-shelf lawyer that Manafort be treated better than virtually every other inmate in the United States. What is remarkable—indeed, shocking—is that the deputy attorney general, the second-highest law enforcement official in the country, seemed to implicitly endorse Blanche’s complaints. On June 11, Jeffrey Rosen forwarded the letter to Vance’s office and asked for a “response” before federal officials made “a decision” about moving Manafort to New York. Rosen even gave Vance a deadline, asking him to respond within a week.

Rosen’s letter creates the impression that the Justice Department is working to undermine state charges against Manafort.

On June 14, Vance responded to Rosen granting Blanche’s request. He also forwarded Rosen a separate letter written by Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy to Loretto’s warden. Conroy described the proposed arrangement as “a departure from usual practice” and “inconsistent” with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. But the district attorney would allow it anyway, almost certainly because Rosen threw the weight of the Department of Justice behind the effort to protect Manafort and attack state charges that Trump would not be able to pardon.

Conroy further noted that the district attorney’s office never actually tried to put Manafort at Rikers Island; it merely sought “temporary custody” in any nearby facility so Manafort could be “made available for arraignment and subsequent proceedings in a timely manner.” Regardless, the district attorney would let Manafort remain at Loretto so long as the feds promised to make him available in New York court “without interruption or delay.”

Vance himself responded to Blanche’s accusations that the New York charges are an illegal violation of double jeopardy. These “gratuitous” arguments, Vance wrote, “have no place in a routine procedural analysis” of inmate relocation. Conroy’s letter also pointed out that if Manafort “believes he has valid statutory double jeopardy” defenses, he “will have a full opportunity to pursue” them in New York court.

For the record, Blanche is probably right that some charges in the New York indictment should fall under the state’s unusually strict double jeopardy regime. But Vance brought other charges under state laws with elements and purposes distinct from their federal counterparts that could to fall outside of double jeopardy protections. For instance, New York laws criminalizing the falsification of business records differ substantially from the federal fraud charges for which Manafort was convicted. While Blanche can mount a plausible argument that the New York indictment runs afoul of state double jeopardy charges, it is certainly not so clear-cut that the state charges should be treated as entirely illegitimate.

I happen to think that no one should be housed in Rikers Island, a hotbed of human rights abuses that ought to be permanently shuttered. I also think states should be prohibited from prosecuting an individual for a crime already punished by the federal government. But I do not believe that the United States Department of Justice should intervene on behalf of the president’s associate to secure benefits for him that no other prisoner receives. It is, in fact, an appalling perversion of the agency’s putative integrity, particularly in light of persistent speculation that Trump may pardon Manafort.

If he does, the task will fall to states to hold Manafort accountable for his crimes, since the president cannot pardon state offenses. Rosen’s letter creates two inescapable impressions: First, that the Department of Justice—so recently responsible for putting Manafort behind bars—is now attempting to keep him as comfortable as possible until Trump issues his pardon; and second, that the DOJ is working to undermine the validity of state charges against Manafort so that he would not languish in state prison if he receives a presidential pardon.

None of this is surprising with Barr in control of the DOJ. A chronic liar and smear artist, Barr has swiftly sullied the agency, turning it into an especially powerful arm of Trump’s PR machine. He and his deputies have all but announced that they have Manafort’s back. Even as the DOJ slow-walks and obstructs the implementation of the First Step Act, keeping rehabilitated prisoners incarcerated for no reason, it helps protect Manafort from the cruelties of the criminal justice system. This is a level of corruption usually only seen in kleptocratic nations. Now it’s right out in the open in these United States."
Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

Republicans press for hearing on Hillary Clinton emails review that found 30 security incidents,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republicans-press-for-hearing-on-hillary-clinton-emails-review-that-found-30-security-incidents,"Republicans are calling on the Democrat-led House Oversight Committee to hold a hearing focusing on the State Department's review of mishandled classified information associated with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server.

The letter, from a trio of Republicans, including the committee's ranking member, Jim Jordan of Ohio, came one day after it was revealed that the State Department has so far found 30 security incidents in its yearslong review.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" they wrote to Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.""

The review of the mishandling of classified information found 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" by 15 individuals, according to Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs. Some of them ""were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" said a letter sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is leading the congressional oversight of the security review.

Taylor said the agency considers any violation of security policies to be a ""serious matter.""

The review caught the attention of President Trump, calling the findings a ""really big"" deal and challenging the Democrats to investigate at a time when they are engaged in a variety of inquiries into the president and his inner circle.

Wow! The State Department said it has identified 30 Security Incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of Crooked Hillary Clinton’s Emails. @FoxNews This is really big. Never admitted before. Highly Classified Material. Will the Dems investigate this? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019

Jordan, along with Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jody Hice of Georgia, warned the ""wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured.""

The individuals under scrutiny were not identified, nor was it revealed if they were still employed at the State Department, per agency policy. The inquiry is ongoing, and Taylor said the number of people found culpable could increase.

Taylor said the violations of infractions by individuals still employed by the State Department were referred to the Bureau of Human Resources. A ""broad range"" of disciplinary or administrative actions that could be taken include ""counseling, reprimand, suspension, and/or separation,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor said the agency is ""making every effort to complete its review and adjudication"" by Sept. 1."

(Reuters)

In the months that he has served as President Trump’s acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan has worked to keep domestic violence incidents within his family private. His wife was arrested after punching him in the face, and his son was arrested after a separate incident in which he hit his mother with a baseball bat. Public disclosure of the nearly decade-old episodes would re-traumatize his young adult children, Shanahan said.

On Tuesday, Trump announced in a tweet that Shanahan would not be going through with the nomination process — which had been delayed by an unusually lengthy FBI background check — “so that he can devote more time to his family.”

Shanahan spoke publicly about the incidents in interviews with The Washington Post on Monday and Tuesday.

“Bad things can happen to good families . . . and this is a tragedy, really,” Shanahan said. Dredging up the episode publicly, he said, “will ruin my son’s life.”

In November 2011, Shanahan rushed to defend his then-17-year-old son, William Shanahan, in the days after the teenager brutally beat his mother. The attack had left Patrick Shanahan’s ex-wife unconscious in a pool of blood, her skull fractured and with internal injuries that required surgery, according to court and police records.

Two weeks later, Shanahan sent his ex-wife’s brother a memo arguing that his son had acted in self-defense.

“Use of a baseball bat in self-

defense will likely be viewed as an imbalance of force,” Shanahan wrote. “However, Will’s mother harassed him for nearly three hours before the incident.”

Details of the incidents have started to emerge in media reports about his nomination, including a USA Today report Tuesday about the punching incident in 2010.

In an hour-long interview Monday night at his apartment in Virginia, Shanahan, who has been responding to questions from The Post about the incidents since January, said he wrote the memo in the hours after his son’s attack, before he knew the full extent of his ex-wife’s injuries. He said that it was to prepare for his son’s initial court appearance and that he never intended for anyone other than his son’s attorneys to read it.

“That document literally was, I sat down with [my son] right away, and being an engineer at an aerospace company, you write down what are all of the mitigating reasons something could have happened. You know, just what’s the list of things that could have happened?” he said.

As he wrote in an ongoing custody battle stemming from their divorce, Shanahan said Monday that he does not believe there can be any justification for an assault with a baseball bat, but he went further in the interview, saying he now regrets writing the passage.

“Quite frankly it’s difficult to relive that moment, and the passage was difficult for me to read. I was wrong to write those three sentences,” Shanahan said.

“I have never believed Will’s attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified. I don’t believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat,” he said.

Kimberley Shanahan, who has since changed her name to Kimberley Jordinson, has not responded to repeated efforts by reporters since January to contact her via email, text, phone and social media seeking comment about the incidents.

Patrick Shanahan’s response when his family was split by acts of domestic violence — including steps he took to manage his son’s surrender to police and attempt to keep him out of jail — is detailed in court filings that have not been previously reported. Court records also contain an earlier episode in which both Shanahan and his wife alleged they were assaulted by one another, and she was arrested.

The Defense Department has long struggled with its own responses to domestic violence, and it has faced a fresh wave of criticism since shortly after Shanahan became deputy secretary of defense in July 2017.

In November of that year, an airman who had been court-martialed for assaulting his wife and stepson killed 26 people and wounded 22 others in a Texas church. A Defense Department investigation later faulted the Air Force for repeatedly failing to submit the serviceman’s fingerprints to a civilian database, which it said should have prevented him from purchasing the firearms used in the mass shooting.

Last month, the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General admonished the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, saying they failed for decades to consistently follow policies requiring military police to thoroughly process crime scenes and interview witnesses following allegations of nonsexual domestic abuse. The watchdog said that in 180 of 219 cases it reviewed, the branches failed to submit criminal histories and fingerprints of offending servicemen to civilian authorities.

Shanahan said his personal experience with domestic violence has taught him there are no simple policy prescriptions. He said domestic violence rates in the military will improve only if the services can change the way they talk about the stresses of serving in the armed forces in a more honest and natural way.

“There’s not one size that fits all — I mean, it’s a very complicated issue,” he said. “It’s not as simple as take this training class or apply these resources or, you know, look for these kinds of symptoms. I mean, it’s not that simple. There are all sorts of dimensions, whether it’s mental health or addiction or stress in the home. It’s a very toxic concoction.

“The thing that’s probably, like a lot of other issues . . . is having a buddy system of people who really care about you and can intervene,” he said. “What I’ve learned is extremely important.”

President Trump said on June 18 that he did not ask Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, to withdraw from consideration to be defense secretary. (Reuters)

‘I was seeing stars’

Patrick Shanahan, 56, climbed the ranks at Boeing over more than two decades, becoming vice president and general manager of the corporation’s commercial airplane program in 2008. An exacting, hard-charging executive who worked grueling hours, he earned the sobriquet “Mr. Fix It” for his ability to turn around sputtering projects worth billions of dollars, such as the aerospace giant’s delayed 787 Dreamliner program.

By 2010, Shanahan was earning more than $935,000 annually in salary and bonuses, court records show.

But there was turbulence in Shanahan’s personal life with his wife of 24 years. Shanahan and two of his children interviewed by The Post said Kimberley Shanahan was growing more erratic. One Thanksgiving, she threw the entire dinner on the floor, saying the family did not appreciate her efforts, they said. A birthday cake his daughter baked for Patrick Shanahan was similarly destroyed, they said.

Things culminated with a physical dispute in August 2010. According to Patrick Shanahan, the incident began when he was lying in bed, following an argument with his wife about their oldest child.

Shanahan said he had his eyes closed, trying to fall asleep, when his wife entered the bedroom and punched him in the face before landing blows to his torso.

“I was seeing stars,” Shanahan said, but he didn’t react, saying he believes that only further enraged his wife.

She then began throwing her husband’s clothes out of a window, according to police and court records, and tried to set them on fire with a propane tank she couldn’t dislodge from a barbecue grill, attempting again later by burning paper towels.

Another physical altercation ensued, with police records indicating that Kimberley Shanahan swung at Patrick Shanahan. She called the police and claimed he punched her in the stomach, an allegation he denies.

When officers arrived, they found him with a bloody nose and scratches on his face, police records show. Authorities charged his wife with domestic violence.

Patrick Shanahan soon filed for divorce and dropped the charges. The file would grow to more than 1,500 pages.

‘It was a hard time to see your son’

Kimberley Shanahan won custody of the children and moved to Florida. Patrick Shanahan remained in Seattle, but the couple’s eldest daughter would soon rejoin him to attend college.

Shortly after midnight on Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2011, Kimberley Shanahan and William got into “a verbal dispute” over her suspicion that the 17-year-old was in a romantic relationship with a 36-year-old woman, according to a police report.

According to police, just after 1:30 a.m., William “shoved and pinned his mother against a bathroom wall” before grabbing a $400 Nike composite baseball bat “to swing at her head,” striking her multiple times.

“I attempted to run away from Will, but as I reached the laundry room, he struck me with the bat in the back of my head,” Kimberley Shanahan wrote in a court filing in the custody case. “The last thing I remember from before I lost consciousness is the impact of the bat, and blood gushing everywhere.”

William, Sarasota police wrote, struck several blows to his mother’s head and torso and left her “to lie in a pool of blood” and then “unplugged the landline phone cord depriving the victim and [the younger brother] the use of 911 to render aid.”

As William fled the home, situated in an exclusive barrier-island development called Bird Key just outside Sarasota, he “tossed a bottle of rubbing alcohol” to his younger brother and told him “you clean her up,” according to the police report.

The younger brother called 911 from a neighbor’s phone, according to police records.

Within hours, William contacted his father, who immediately booked a predawn flight to Florida, according to court records and documents provided by Shanahan.

Kimberley Shanahan was hospitalized early that morning and later required surgery, she wrote in a filing. Among her injuries were a fractured skull and elbow, according to the police report.

While she was in the hospital, authorities began to search for William, according to records released to The Post by Sarasota police.

Police distributed a photo of William to patrol cars on Bird Key. They tried to track the young man’s cellphone, but it appeared to be turned off, police wrote. They canvassed a local park and bridges to the mainland. They searched a local yacht club. But there was no trace of him, according to records.

Patrick Shanahan landed in Florida just before 5 p.m. on Wednesday. He arranged to stay with William in a hotel.

“Mr. Shanahan’s response when he learned of the assault was to book Will a hotel room,” Kimberley Shanahan wrote.

Patrick Shanahan said it’s a bit of a blur.

“It was a hard time to see your son — hopefully you’ll never be in that spot someday,” he said. “I wasn’t hiding. We got a hotel and talked to the attorney, and we just camped out.”

Shanahan did not visit the hospital where his ex-wife was taken, she later wrote in a custody filing. Instead, over four days that included Thanksgiving, he worked to assemble a defense team and enlist family members and friends to attend an initial hearing to try to persuade a judge to let his son stay out of jail while he fought the charges.

Derek Byrd, head of a well-known Sarasota defense firm hired by Patrick Shanahan to represent his son in the criminal case, said in an interview that the elder Shanahan acted appropriately by not contacting police until his son could consult a defense attorney, a process that was delayed by the Thanksgiving holiday.

Byrd also said that Patrick Shanahan was not aware that police were searching for his son in the days after the attack.

“I don’t think Pat handled that time frame inappropriately,” Byrd said in an interview. “I think he was just doing what a reasonable dad should probably do. I’m sure the timeline looks bad on paper, but he didn’t do anything that I consider out of the ordinary, and he wasn’t hiding Will.”

Byrd said Patrick Shanahan first contacted his firm within a day of arriving in Florida, either Wednesday night or Thursday, which was Thanksgiving. He said a lawyer from the firm could not meet with the Shanahans until Friday morning, after the holiday.

Later on Friday, another attorney from the firm contacted the detective handling the case, Kenneth Halpin.

According to the detective’s report, the attorney said he would arrange for the younger Shanahan to turn himself in — after two more days, on Sunday evening, Nov. 27.

“Detective Halpin trusted us to do that,” Byrd told The Post. “He said, ‘Fine.’ ”

Halpin told The Post that he could not recall the conversation but probably would have cast it differently:

“If someone calls and says they’re going to turn in a suspect on a Sunday night, and he’s already lawyered up with someone who has a reputation like Byrd, for being on TV, what can you do? You can’t force an attorney to turn in his client,” Halpin said, adding: “I’m sure I would have also told him that there’s paper out for him, so they’re still going to snatch him up if he’s found.”

That Sunday night, Patrick Shanahan drove William to a police station to surrender, according to police records and a timeline of events prepared by a Shanahan spokesman.

His mother attended his court appearance the next morning.

“My neighbor took me to the court hearing, and both of us were shocked to see Pat in the courtroom,” she wrote in the filing, saying she had believed until then that he had been in Seattle.

‘He doesn’t believe in violence’

Patrick Shanahan and Byrd came to the hearing prepared to plead for the younger Shanahan to remain out of custody, citing his baseball career at an exclusive youth sports academy and prep school attended by sons and daughters of major league athletes.

“He’s a college baseball prospect. He has dreams. He has a future. His father is an executive of Boeing,” Byrd said, according to an audio recording that the court released to The Post. “If he has to sit in jail for 21 days, not only is that going to traumatize him, he’s not going to finish the semester, probably get kicked off the baseball team . . . everything is going to be over for him.”

Patrick Shanahan also vouched for his son.

“He doesn’t believe in violence,” he told the judge. “I’ve never seen him act aggressively toward his brother or any other family members, so it’s a shock to me what has happened.”

The judge declined to release William Shanahan, calling pictures of the crime scene “horrendous.”

He was initially charged with two felonies, aggravated battery and tampering with a victim, and faced up to 15 years in prison.

In the custody filing is the four-page memo Patrick Shanahan wrote at the time.

It lists “mitigating circumstances” that should be considered in evaluating the alleged assault.

A Shanahan spokesman provided a copy of the email containing the memo retained by Shanahan’s brother-in-law, showing it had been sent on Dec. 8, 2011, two weeks after the attack, and 10 days after Patrick Shanahan was present at the court hearing with his injured ex-wife.

First, Patrick Shanahan wrote, his 17-year-old son had “acted in self-defense.”

“She fueled the situation by berating him repeatedly in his room in a manner that escalated emotionally and physically,” he wrote.

The memo continues, alleging a history of substance abuse, emotional abuse and violent tendencies by Kimberley Shanahan. “Over the last 7+ years I have worked as much as possible, partially out of a desire to avoid inevitable conflicts with Kim,” Shanahan wrote. It casts his ex-wife as the instigator in conflicts with him and their children. “It appears that when I was not around to yell at, she started becoming intensely focused on berating, terrorizing and beat them down emotionally.”

Kimberley Shanahan disputed those characterizations.

“I have always been a very loving and dedicated mom,” she wrote in a court filing responding to the memo, “and I have never emotionally abused any of my children for any period of time.”

Kevin Cameron, Kimberley Shanahan’s brother, said he was not bothered by Patrick Shanahan’s memo because he believed Shanahan wrote it before he had all of the facts about the assault.

“If anything, I believe Pat fully understands and is better equipped to deal with domestic violence than most people,” Cameron wrote in a letter to The Post. “He has seen it. He has lived it. He understands that domestic violence is real and prevalent. He understands that it can impact anyone of any age, gender, race and socioeconomic status.”

‘We moved on’

Kris Roberts, a police officer who assisted in the search for William Shanahan, recalled that after the arrest, his father was a “hindrance” in a follow-up matter, as police investigated whether there had been an inappropriate relationship between the adult woman and William. Under Florida law, William was too young at the time to have had a consenting sexual relationship with the woman. Roberts, a retired detective with the Longboat Key Police Department, said the father, whom she could not remember by name, would not turn over his son’s cellphone.

After the surrender to police, “his father would not talk to me; he wasn’t helping,” Roberts said. “I remember he had a West Coast address, Seattle maybe, and when he left, the son’s cellphone was just gone.” Roberts said she believes Patrick Shanahan took his son’s cellphone back to Seattle with him.

Roberts said that without the cooperation of the father, the investigation fell apart. “We only had one love letter between them, but it didn’t speak to anything sexual,” Roberts said. The adult woman “soon lawyered up, too, and we moved on.”

Byrd, the attorney for William Shanahan; an attorney who represents Patrick Shanahan in Seattle; and a Shanahan spokesman said they were not aware of a formal request for the cellphone.

Prosecutors would go on to charge William as an adult with one felony: aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. He pleaded down to a third-degree felony, and in 2012, a state prosecutor agreed to a “withhold of adjudication,” curtailing the length of the sentence and probation. The post-sentencing maneuver is not recognized outside of Florida, and William’s record could not be sealed or expunged in the state because it involved a violent domestic assault.

William was ordered to spend 18 months at a Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranch and sentenced to four years’ probation. Both penalties were later reduced.

The following year, in 2013, William enrolled at the University of Washington, according to his LinkedIn page. His father had recently joined the university’s board of regents. The family had other ties to the school. Patrick Shanahan’s father, Michael, had served as police chief for the university for more than two decades.

William graduated last June with a degree in political science, a university spokesman said.

Kimberley Shanahan lost custody of the couple’s youngest child in 2014, when a judge wrote that she had “engaged in abusive use of conflict that is seriously detrimental” to the child. According to multiple accounts, she is now estranged from all three of her children. At his last confirmation hearing, to become deputy secretary of defense in June 2017, all three children were sitting behind Patrick Shanahan.

None of the senators asked him about domestic violence.

Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY

WASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, will not be transferred to New York's infamous Rikers Island jail after the Department of Justice cited health concerns.

Manafort is serving seven and a half years in federal prison on charges related to his foreign lobbying efforts as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was being held in a federal prison in Pennsylvania but has been transferred to a federal facility in Manhattan, Reuters reported.

However, Manafort was supposed to be transferred to Rikers Island in New York later this month as he awaits trial in state court for multiple charges under New York law for residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business, according to the New York Times.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen last week sent a letter to Manhattan prosecutors saying that the Department of Justice was monitoring where Manafort would be held in New York, the Times reported.

And, Manafort will no longer be transferred to Rikers Island, according to the Times. A senior DOJ official in a statement to ABC News said that the department got involved after Manafort's attorneys raised concerns ""related to his health and personal safety.""

During Manafort's federal trial, his lawyers said he had gout.

President Donald Trump has in the past said that he thought Manafort's sentence was ""very unfair"" and has complained about how his former campaign manager has been treated.

First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for the DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."
"Trump EPA close to gutting Obama rule on coal power plants - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/trump-epa-close-gutting-obama-rule-coal-power-plants-2019-jun,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is close to completing one of its biggest rollbacks of environmental rules, replacing a landmark Obama-era effort that sought to wean the nation's electrical grid off coal-fired power plants and their climate-damaging pollution.

The final Trump administration replacement rule, expected as soon as this week, instead would give individual states wide discretion to decide whether to require limited efficiency upgrades at individual coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency said Administrator Andrew Wheeler would have a major policy announcement Wednesday but did not disclose the topic. Democrats, environmentalists, industry representatives and others, however, expect the final rule on coal plants.

Advertisement - Story continues below

Joseph Goffman, an EPA official under President Barack Obama, said he feared that the Trump administration was trying to set a legal precedent that the Clean Air Act gives the federal government ""next to no authority to do anything"" about climate-changing emissions from the country's power grid. The Obama rule, adopted in 2015, sought to reshape the country's power system by encouraging utilities to rely less on dirtier-burning coal-fired power plants and more on electricity from natural gas, solar, wind and other lower or no-carbon sources.

Burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and heat is the main human source of heat-trapping carbon emissions.

Supporters of the revised rule say the Obama-era plan overstepped the EPA's authority.

""This action is recalibrating EPA so it aligns with being the agency to protect public health and the environment in a way that respects the limits of the law,"" said Mandy Gunasekara, a former senior official at the EPA who helped write the replacement rule. She now runs a nonprofit, Energy45, that supports President Donald Trump's energy initiatives.

""The Clean Power Plan was designed largely to put coal out of business,"" Gunasekara said. Trump's overhaul is meant to let states ""figure out what is best for their mission in terms of meeting modern environmental standards"" and providing affordable energy, she said.

Democrats and environmentalists say the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the power of government to protect the sagging U.S. coal industry from competition against cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas and solar and wind power while ignoring scientific warnings about climate change.

With coal miners at his side , Trump signed an order in March 2017 directing the EPA to scrap the Obama rule. It was one of the first acts of his presidency.

His pledge to roll back regulation for the coal industry helped cement support from owners and workers in the coal industry, and others. Despite his promise, market forces have frustrated Trump's efforts . Competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable fuel has continued a yearslong trend driving U.S. coal plant closings to near-record levels last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The final rule is expected to closely follow the draft released in August.

By encouraging utilities to consider spending money to upgrade aging coal plants, environmental groups argue, the Trump rule could prompt the companies to run existing coal plants harder and longer rather than retiring them.

""It's a rule to increase emissions because it's a rule to extend the life of coal plants,"" said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director of the Clean Air Task Force. ""You invest in updating an old coal plant, it makes it more economic"" to run it more to pay off that investment.

An Associated Press analysis Tuesday of federal air data showed U.S. progress on cleaning the air may be stagnating after decades of improvement. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when America had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980.

Trump has repeatedly claimed just the opposite, saying earlier this month in Ireland: ""We have the cleanest air in the world, in the United States, and it's gotten better since I'm president.""

Along with an initiative requiring tougher mileage standards for cars and light trucks, the Clean Power Plan was one of Obama's two legacy efforts to slow climate change. The Trump administration also is proposing to roll back the Obama-era mileage standards, with a final rule expected shortly. Environmental groups promise court challenges to both rollbacks.

Trump has rejected scientific warnings on climate change, including a report this year from scientists at more than a dozen federal agencies noting that global warming from fossil fuels ""presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life.""

EPA's own regulatory analysis last year estimated that Trump's replacement ACE rule would kill an extra 300 to 1,500 people each year by 2030, owing to additional air pollution from the power grid."

But it's worth checking the US State Department advisories for each country to learn more about any risks before you get there.

The State Department uses four levels of travel guidance to offer Americans advice, set boundaries, and describe the risks of each country:

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution

Level 3 - Reconsider travel

Level 4 - Do not travel

Only one country, Venezuela, is classified as a Level 4, because of the ongoing conflict there. The other countries on the continent are all Level 1 or 2.

"Interior's internal FOIA policy gives political appointees sign-off on document releases, raising concerns",https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/interior-foia-process/index.html,"(CNN) The Interior Department has developed a second, undisclosed internal Freedom of Information Act review policy, which requires certain political appointees to sign off on documents before releasing them publicly, according to internal emails and documents reviewed by CNN.

This extra layer of review, established in a draft memo in May 2018 that CNN has viewed, requires the deputy chief of staff, director of communications and the deputy solicitor to be copied on documents that mention politically appointed staff members before they are released in response to a FOIA request, a process critics say is injecting politics into what is supposed to be a nonpolitical process.

Government agencies have internal FOIA offices that handle all FOIA requests. These offices are typically staffed by career officials, not political appointees. Agencies can develop their own internal processes for how they respond to FOIA requests, but the process is supposed to remain nonpartisan.

The emails and documents CNN reviewed are included in a complaint from Earthjustice, representing environmental advocacy groups the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, to the Interior Department's inspector general.

In the complaint, the groups ask the IG to investigate the department's practices when responding to FOIA requests, because they are concerned this extra layer of review is slowing the department's responses to the requests, contributing to missed court-mandated deadlines to produce internal documents. Earthjustice is a litigation firm that frequently represents environmental groups.

While the process is laid out in a draft memo, it is not included in the department's ""awareness process,"" which has been published publicly and is dated May 24, 2018. The Interior Department acknowledges only the ""awareness process"" as its official FOIA review policy.

The Interior Department did not directly respond when asked about the draft memo with the extra layer of review from certain political appointees and whether it is still used. In response to CNN's questions, Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said, ""The official policy that we adhere to is published on our website.""

The ""awareness process,"" published publicly, requires FOIA officers to search all documents for mentions of any political appointees. Then an attorney from the department's Solicitor's Office and any relevant employees are given 72 hours to review the documents before they're released publicly. The policy states that if no one responds after 72 hours, silence is considered an acknowledgment that the document production can move forward.

The department updated the ""awareness process"" on February 28, instructing FOIA personnel to first notify their bureau contact, then make a list of all political appointees included in the document production, then notify a Solicitor's Office attorney. The reviewer and attorney are then given three days to review the documents.

However, internal emails obtained by environmental advocacy groups through FOIA show that a second layer of review and approval by certain political appointees was added along with the awareness process. It just wasn't included in the official memo.

Emails show secret process started in May 2018

The extra layer of review first appears in a draft memo in May 2018 called ""Day in the Life of the OS FOIA Office."" In the memo, it states that after the documents produced in response to a FOIA request are returned from the Solicitor's Office, a FOIA official reviews the documents for any political appointees. Then the political appointees named have ""72-hour awareness to 5 days"" to review the documents.

""Deputy Chief of Staff, Director of Communications, and the Deputy Solicitor are cc'd"" on each group of documents being reviewed by any political appointees as well, the memo states.

While this language was not included in the ""awareness process"" dated May 24, internal emails reviewed by CNN suggest that certain political appointees were copied on documents produced in response to FOIA requests, a sign the process is being followed, and the advocacy groups allege it caused the department to miss or almost miss at least three court-ordered document production deadlines.

An email from Interior FOIA Public Liaison Clarice Julka sent on June 11, 2018, says that ""in addition to the written policy on awareness review, please do the following: For any releases of documents involving the following offices: Comms, OCL, Exec Sec, External Affairs, Secretary, Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs of Staff and their assistants, please send the records and the response to DCOS, Downey Magallanes, at least 72 hours prior to release and confirm with her prior to release.""

OCL is the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs. Magallanes was the deputy chief of staff to the secretary at the time that the email was sent.

On August 2, 2018, Nicholas Banco, who works in the FOIA office, emailed Magallanes, then-press secretary Heather Swift and a handful of other political appointees, saying, ""Unfortunately, the Department has missed its initial proposed date for production and DOJ is seeking a release as soon as possible. OS is intending to release the attached materials no later than August 6, 2018. Please expedite your review if at all possible.""

The groups allege that Banco was waiting for an affirmation from the political appointees copied on the email before moving forward with document production. An email from acting Associate Solicitor Aaron Moody sent on May 1, 2018, to Magallanes asks her to complete her awareness review before the following day so the department can meet a court-ordered deadline. The groups allege this approval is also the reason these documents were held up.

A separate email from a staffer in the department's FOIA office, Ryan McQuighan, requests ""affirmative response"" from two political appointees copied on the email before he can release documents. The advocacy groups allege that this email shows McQuighan was waiting for their response to move forward with document production. On April 2, 2018, McQuighan writes that""deadline for this FOIA was last Friday, so we need to get affirmative response soon.""

Not illegal, but 'concerning'

FOIA experts say that while on its face this added layer of review by political appointees is not illegal, it raises concerns.

Elizabeth Hempowicz, the director of public policy for the Project on Government Oversight, said that if the political appointee's decisions are ""based on anything other than the law"" -- such as being ""based on political considerations, how it will affect the administration"" -- that could make the implementation of the policy illegal.

""Now, you are involving them in the decision making of what's going out, and that's where there might be some impropriety,"" Hempowicz told CNN.

The documents that show the creation and implementation of the two policies were originally obtained through a series of FOIA requests by the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. The groups first made the requests in June 2018, and they received documents from the Interior Department between August 2018 and March 2019. The groups went to court to obtain the documents, according to Earthjustice attorney Yuting Chi.

""They're allowed to have a process. They are allowed to have departmental regulations. What they're not allowed to do is to fail to meet the FOIA deadlines that is statutorily mandated,"" Chi told CNN.

This is not the first time the agency has come under scrutiny for its handling of FOIA requests.

At the end of 2018, the department proposed a rule that would change how the agency responds to FOIA requests. The proposal, which claimed it was designed to ""streamline the FOIA submission process,"" would limit the number of requests individuals or groups could make each month. It would also allow the department to ""not honor a request that requires an unreasonably burdensome search.""

A department spokeswoman said making the process more efficient would ""ensure more equitable and regular access to federal records for all requesters, not just litigious special interest groups.""

During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 22, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said he was deciding what to do about the proposed FOIA rule after receiving feedback from a bipartisan group of senators and thousands of public comments on the rule itself.

""I'm considering whether we should scrap it, whether we should proceed with it or whether we should significantly modify it,"" Bernhardt said during the hearing."
Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
Trump lashes out at his once-favorite network: 'Something weird going on at Fox',https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Ed Mazza']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/18/trump-lashes-out-at-his-once-favorite-network-something-weird-going-on-at-fox/23752043/,"President Donald Trump on Monday slammed Fox News after his once-favorite network released a new poll that shows him trailing against many of his potential 2020 Democratic rivals.

The poll shows Trump losing to former Vice President Joe Biden by 10 points and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 9. It also shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with very small leads over Trump.

“Something weird going on at Fox,” the president tweeted. “Our polls show us leading in all 17 Swing States.”

It’s not clear what internal polls he was referring to. However, Trump reportedly fired some of his own pollsters after leaked internal polls showed him trailing Biden in key states.

.@FoxNews Polls are always bad for me. They were against Crooked Hillary also. Something weird going on at Fox. Our polls show us leading in all 17 Swing States. For the record, I didn’t spend 30 hours with @abcnews, but rather a tiny fraction of that. More Fake News @BretBaier — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2019

Last month, Trump slammed Fox News for even covering the Democrats, and was especially annoyed at the network’s town hall event featuring Buttigieg.

“Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems,” he wrote.

Trump still seems to favor Sean Hannity, a network host who not only supports the president but has taken the stage with him at a rally.

The president didn’t mention Hannity by name, but in the evening cited the network for something that appeared on his show:

"‘Human capital crisis’ at EPA, retirement for 40% of staff",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/human-capital-crisis-at-epa-retirement-for-40-of-staff,"The Environmental Protection Agency is bleeding workers.

“I do have a concern absolutely. Forty percent of our workforce is eligible to retire over the next five years. While I don’t expect them all to retire in the next five years, I expect them to be gone in the next 10 years,” said Administrator Andrew Wheeler.

“I consider it a human capital crisis,” he added.

The issue is one being felt throughout government and business as baby boomers retire and younger workers come and go with much more regularity.

Wheeler, for example, said the EPA has always budgeted for workers to stay for decades. “We have a history at the agency of hiring people out of school and expecting them to stay 30, 40 years. We have 10 employees who have been here 49 years,” he said in an interview.

But that’s not happening anymore.

And, he added, government rules make it hard to start looking for a new employee before a retiring worker leaves the building. “You lose that institutional knowledge because they aren’t there to train their replacement.""

The White House, he said, is trying to give agencies more flexibility in hiring. But Wheeler said he is also taking charge, noting that he helped in the interviewing process of new EPA human resources director.

“Administrators don’t typically interview at that level,” he said, but added, “I want to meet who we’re going to hire before we hire them because on Day One I’m going to hit them with a dozen things and I want to make sure that they don’t get scared off.”"
House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."
"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray seeking more details on the probe.

In 2017, the Justice Department announced it would investigate the sale of human fetal tissue in response to a Judiciary Committee probe lead by Mr. Grassley, who formerly chaired the panel. At the conclusion of the committee’s probe, Mr. Grassley referred eight organizations, including Planned Parenthood, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.

The referrals allege the organizations may have violated laws that ban the purchase or sale of human fetal tissue.

“Preventing the illegal sale of human fetal tissue remains a priority for the committee,” the senators wrote in the letters.

They have asked the Justice Department to update them on any action the FBI has taken on the criminal referrals or its justification for not taking any action. The senators have requested a response by July 2.

LI's congressional delegation calls on EPA to move faster on drinking water standards,https://www.newsday.com,['David M. Schwartz'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.newsday.com/long-island/environment/drinking-water-standards-epa-1.32577711,"As the state prepares to recommend drinking water standards for emerging contaminants, Long Island’s congressional delegation called Tuesday for the federal government to set its own standards and help local governments pay for treatment.

“We ask the Environmental Protection Agency to act with urgency,” Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) said at the Town of Hempstead's water department. “This situation requires increased technical support and financial support” for water providers.

Rice was joined by Reps. Peter King (R-Seaford), Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) and Thomas Suozzi (D-Glen Cove); Nassau County Executive Laura Curran; Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen; environmental advocates and water providers.

The bipartisan turnout “shows this is a full-court press,” King said.

New York State has been developing drinking water standards for 1,4 dioxane; and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which is found in firefighting foams, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in manufacturing stain- and water-resistant materials.

Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told Newsday it was a “matter of weeks” before the state Department of Health released its recommended drinking water standards. That would trigger a monthslong public comment period before the standard becomes enforceable.

Local water providers face massive cleanup costs to remove 1,4-dioxane, PFOS and PFOA, which scientists have linked to negative health effects, including cancer, and have been detected in drinking water.

Long Island water providers have estimated it will cost $1.5 billion to remove the three emerging contaminants.

An analysis last month of federal data by the New York Public Interest Group found that Long Island’s drinking water had the most emerging contaminants in New York State.

Ty Fuller, chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, said the federal testing requirement didn't include communities served by smaller water providers such as upstate Hoosick Falls, which has been dealing with PFAS contamination in its drinking water.

“It’s not the most contaminated, it’s the most tested,” said Fuller, who is also Suffolk County Water Authority's director of strategic initiatives and lead hydrogeologist of Long Island's drinking water. “A lack of testing does not mean a lack of contamination.”

Elizabeth Moran, environmental policy director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said, “The simple truth is Long Island’s sole source aquifer is susceptible to contamination because of a lot of development and industrial legacy.”

Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said, “We’re not just testing more here. We’re finding more here.”

The EPA has said it's studying the health effects of PFAS to determine a national drinking water standard.

EPA spokesman Elías Rodríguez said in a statement, ""EPA appreciates the congressional delegation’s interest and commitment to the community. EPA shares that commitment to protect public health and the environment and we are working to develop a response to the members.""

Zeldin criticized the EPA for not yet responding to a letter from the delegation sent June 7, asking for the agency to provide greater assistance to Long Island water providers. A federal standard would help Long Island authorities when dealing with federal agencies like the Department of Defense on issues like cleanup around military sites, he said.

Moran said the standards recommended in December by a panel of experts convened by Cuomo are not as stringent as the latest science suggests is necessary to protect public health."
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
I-Team: U.S. Department of Education investigating Duke-UNC Consortium after complaints of anti-Semitism,https://abc11.com,['Jonah Kaplan'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://abc11.com/i-team-us-dept-of-education-investigating-duke-unc-consortium/5350504/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together. I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone."" That was before he sang a song with the lyrics: ""Don't think of Rihanna when you sing this, don't think of Beyonce - think of Mel Gibson. I'm in love with a Jew/Oh/I fell in love with a Jew/Oh/Her skin is white and my skin is brown, she was going up up and I was going down.""""I'd like to thank Secretary Devos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,"" Rep. Holding said in response to the new investigation. ""I hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.""Many department heads and sponsors demanded their money back after the controversy erupted.In a scathing letter to leaders of the UNC Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies, which officially sponsored the event, UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley said: ""Due to your inclusion of conference content over which I had no knowledge or control, I have been forced to spend most of the last two days responding to outraged members of my own community who are ashamed and embarrassed to see the law school shown as a sponsor of what they consider hate speech.""A statement released by UNC Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz called the performance ""disturbing"" and that he is ""heartbroken and deeply offended that this performance happened. I stand steadfast against Anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.""UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to directly answer any questions about the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, the university said."

In 2014, Obama signed a bill that permitted veterans to seek private care outside of Veterans Affairs facilities. It also gave money for the VA to hire additional doctors and nurses and overhauled the VA's electronic medical records.

Trump did sign the VA Mission bill, which permits veterans to have a private doctor if their wait time is 20 days (28 days in the case of specialty care) or if their drive is 30 minutes, according to an Associated Press fact check of similar comments by the president.

Dems want to nuke DOJ policy barring presidential prosecutions,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-want-to-nuke-doj-policy-barring-presidential-prosecutions,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller said last month that charging President Trump with a crime “was not an option we could consider” because of the Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of sitting presidents.

Democrats are now talking about finding a way to change that.

“Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, recently proposed.

WARREN PROPOSES LAW SAYING A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED

And other congressional Democrats have since said they are considering whether the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel 1973 memorandum against charging a sitting president should be revoked -- though no legislation has been introduced just yet.

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told The Hill.

Another lawmaker, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, suggested that a measure revoking the policy could be included in some sort of spending package or authorization bill.

“I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” Connolly told The Hill.

While Mueller in his report said his investigation found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, the special counsel declined to issue a conclusion in the report about whether Trump obstructed justice through his comments and actions related to the investigation. The president repeatedly referred to the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and allegedly sought to have Mueller removed -- but he never did, and Trump has recently disputed that he even sought the special counsel's ouster.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said during his public statement last month, adding that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

After the release of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, but Democrats have argued Trump would have been charged with obstruction had he not been president. Republicans, meanwhile, have countered that Trump could not have been charged with obstruction since Mueller determined there was no underlying crime of conspiring with the Russians.

TRUMP CLAIMS 'OBAMA HAD TO KNOW ABOUT' EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE PRESIDENCY

The fresh chatter about upending the DOJ guidance amounts to the latest Democratic bid to reexamine federal policy toward alleged wrongdoing of sitting presidents.

Last month, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats introduced the “No President Is Above the Law Act.” The sponsors said in a news release at the time that it would pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president and “ensure that presidents can be held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American and not use the presidency to avoid legal consequences.”

""No person can be permitted to evade accountability for their actions just because they happen to be president,"" Nadler said. ""I have concerns with the Justice Department interpretation that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but if that is the policy, a president who commits a crime before or during their term in office, could exploit this loophole and avoid prosecution just because the statute of limitations has run out. This is unacceptable. The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.""

Even though Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, several Democratic presidential candidates are now indicating on the campaign trail that they would support a DOJ investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice if they win the White House in 2020.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said last week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said last week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

Trump, during an interview that aired Sunday night on ABC News, denied being worried about being prosecuted once he leaves office.

“Did nothing wrong,” Trump said. “There was no collusion.”

In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City. Utahns should hope they can be next,https://www.deseretnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900075743/in-our-opinion-the-department-of-agriculture-is-moving-workers-to-kanas-city-utahns-should-hope-they-can-be-next-blm-usda.html,"Utah is still waiting to see whether the Trump administration decides to move its Bureau of Land Management headquarters here from Washington — a move that makes sense considering how most BLM decisions affect the West much more than any property along the Potomac.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."
EPA will allow use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448970-epa-will-allow-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Monday it will allow states to use a pesticide that is harmful to bees.

The agency made an emergency exception for 11 states to use sulfoxaflor on cotton and sorghum crops.

ADVERTISEMENT

“The only emergency here is the Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this dangerous bee-killing pesticide,” Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s sickening that even amid the current insect apocalypse, the EPA’s priority is protecting pesticide industry profits.”

A study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the emergency declaration has been used for four consecutive years in most of the states.

Sulfoxaflor’s use was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, but the EPA in 2016 changed its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the impact on bees. Cotton and sorghum were not included in the directive.

The EPA’s Office of Inspector General wrote in a report last year that the agency did not have processes in place to determine how its emergency measures impact human and environmental health.

An EPA spokesperson said the emergency exemption was granted with public safety in mind, as well as the needs of farmers.

""This decision is based in part on information from the states demonstrating an urgent need and a lack of available alternatives to address the pest pressures within their states. Mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize exposure and reduce the potential for unreasonable risks to the environment. The approvals include advisory guidance for protecting bees, and users must also follow all existing EPA guidance for pollinator protection,"" an EPA spokesperson said."

State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

Mississippi’s Mental-Illness Policies Are Working. DOJ Is Challenging Them.,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['John Hirschauer', 'John Fund', 'Alexandra Desanctis', 'Andrew C.

The state is leading a quiet revolt.

Despite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services.

Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.

Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens.

DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C., which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.

The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.

First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:

“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”

Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”

This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that.

Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead-based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis, 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services.

The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment.

Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):

A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.

Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides?

Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for.

Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Olmstead highlighted the imprecision with which the majority used the word “discrimination” to describe Georgia’s decision to treat patients in “an institutional setting after they became eligible for community placement.” He presciently noted that “by adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this Court.” But even Ginsburg acknowledged an appellate court’s ruling that “the State’s duty to provide integrated services ‘is not absolute.’” States are allowed by Olmstead to preserve institutional settings necessary for the most severely ill, and the cost of preserving those settings may, in the fiscally limited world of state government, preclude those with less severe impairments from receiving commensurate services.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy warned that “it would be a tragic event . . . were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” This is precisely what the DOJ is doing. Mississippi is not a straggler to be dragged across deinstitutionalization’s finish line; the state is a necessary rebuke to policies that have relegated the severely mentally ill to lives of squalor and neglect on our nation’s streets and in our prisons."
Joe Biden’s Glide vs. Elizabeth Warren’s Grind,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-run/articles/2019-06-18/joe-bidens-glide-vs-elizabeth-warrens-grind,"Speaking separately at a forum focused on the poor on Monday, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren somehow managed to use strikingly similar vernacular when discussing the importance of a government budget.

""Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget,"" the former vice president quipped, quoting his father before an audience at the Poor People's Campaign, a group dedicated to placing poverty at the center of the political discourse. ""I will tell you what you value.""

About three hours later, standing on the same stage at Trinity Washington University, the Massachusetts senator said, ""Tell me how you spend your money and I'll tell you what your values are. Because that's where it shows up.""

The similarities between the two Democratic presidential rivals ended there.

More than five months after her livestreamed kitchen beer chug fell flat, Warren is now buzzing with promise. As she continues to steadily climb in polls, she's threatening Sen. Bernie Sanders' position as the primary race's progressive vanguard. Even President Donald Trump, who wrote her off months ago, is wondering if he did so too soon.

When the Democratic debates get underway in Miami next week, Warren will not be on the same stage as Biden, due to a partially randomized drawing that separated the 20 candidates into two sets of 10 based on their polling positions.

But as evidenced on Monday, the style and approach of the ascendant full-throated progressive and the deeply entrenched front-runner could hardly be more disparate.

Biden was his usual whimsical self, bouncing from point to point and using his favorite long-held colloquialisms as transitions. But the 76-year-old soon began meandering – not necessarily aimlessly – but without a predetermined, overarching purpose.

""You're looking at me like you want me to stop? You want me to answer any more or you want me to stop?"" he asked the moderators as he winded through the first question, which in fairness, was also long-winded.

He did not stop.

This freewheeling approach led Biden to some conspicuous declarations.

If he were the Democratic nominee, he would win Georgia and South Carolina, the latter being the more far-fetched possibility since a Democrat hasn't done so since 1976 and Trump carried it by double-digits three years ago.

Biden said everyone was entitled to have ""total health care."" He hasn't unveiled a health care plan to date but seemed to spontaneously endorse a universal Medicaid program. There was no white paper or explanatory Medium post to follow.

Later, he promised his first act as president would be to roll back Trump's tax cut, but he didn't detail conditions of which, if any, part he'd leave in place.

""The first thing I would do as president is eliminate the president's tax cut, which added to the deficit $2 trillion. And also we now have $1 trillion, $600 billion in tax expenditures, fancy word for saying loopholes,"" Biden said.

He does not yet have a tax plan of his own.

Presented with nearly the exact same question at the top of her presentation, Warren barely took two minutes to move to the underlying argument that defines her candidacy.

""We have a fundamental issue, and that is, who is our government going to work for?"" she asked. ""Is it going to just keep working for the rich and the powerful?""

Soon after, she surgically transitioned from the bland talk of budgets to her proposed wealth tax, the first major policy rollout of her campaign, which she unveiled back in January and has been touting for months.

Biden looked to be improvising policy pronouncements on the fly, based on his long experience as a politician who has fielded tens of thousands of questions over a nearly 50-year political career. It's not that Biden didn't have answers. It's that, perhaps, he had too many.

Warren, on the other hand, approached this forum as she has with almost every appearance she makes, from a town hall in Dubuque, Iowa, to a studio interview on MSNBC. It's her methodical system of using every question to return to her targeted flagship message of structural economic inequality and her trove of plans to fix it.

Warren, running from behind, is grinding each day out with disciplined, wonky purpose. Biden, the leader, is gliding through the process largely on his chummy personal panache.

Another difference between Biden and Warren is how they view the fight with Republicans to get their legislative priorities enacted. Biden isn't afraid of a scuffle, just as Warren doesn't rule out compromise, but their instincts are clear.

""Joy-Ann,"" Biden said to MSNBC host Joy Reid. ""I know you're one of the ones who thinks it's naive to think we have to work together. The fact of the matter is, if we can't get a consensus, nothing happens except abuse of power by the executive. Zero.""

Biden said he was willing to take a ""brass knuckle fight"" to the GOP on certain things, but he eventually returned to his larger point that reaching across the aisle would be a trademark of his administration.

""You've got to make it clear to the Republicans that you understand on some things there's a rationale for compromise,"" he said.

To round out his answer, Biden then toggled back into an errant comment that still requires explanation.

""Let's start a real physical revolution if you're going to talk about it,"" he said. The campaign's press operation did not respond to an inquiry about its meaning.

Warren relished the opportunity to use her executive pen on her first day as president for actions like a moratorium on drilling for oil on federal lands. She also held up her proposal to kill the filibuster, the tool that the minority uses to delay and ultimately block sweeping legislative actions.

""If we're in the majority and Mitch McConnell wants to block us … then I'm all for getting rid of the filibuster. We cannot let him block things the way he did during the Obama administration,"" she said.

When Rev. William Barber, one of the group's co-chairs, pressed Warren not to abandon the traditionally Republican South in her campaign, she told him she'd already been to Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, three of the 20 states she's visited, holding 100 town halls, answering 2,000 unfiltered questions and snapping 30,000 selfies.

But it wouldn't be a true Warren response if she didn't steer it back to her core: ""Ask yourself why I've got the time to do that and most other candidates don't. And the reason is because I'm not spending my time behind closed doors with a bunch of millionaires."""
"One-Quarter Of U.S. Soybean Crop Remains Unplanted, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/one-third-of-us-soybean-crop-remains-unplanted-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. soybean is slightly more than three-fourths planted, while the corn crop is emerging nearly 20% slower than its five-year average.



Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 92% complete, behind the 100% five-year average.

The planting rate is equal to what the trade had expected. This leaves about 7.0 million acres left to be planted.

As of Sunday, Ohio farmers had 68% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 100% five-year average. South Dakota farmers have 78% of their corn seeded, behind a 100% five-year average.

Also, 79% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 97% five-year average.

Housing authorities raise concerns about Trump plan to evict undocumented immigrants,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/other/449065-housing-authorities-raise-concerns-about-plans-to-evict-undocumented,"Landlords and local housing authorities are pushing back on a Trump administration plan to evict undocumented immigrants from subsidized housing, according to The New York Times.

The proposal from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would ban households with one or more undocumented member from living in such housing, but housing administrators and landlords say it would put the onus of immigration enforcement on them.

Under the proposal, released in April, they would have to evict up to 108,000 people receiving benefits, most of whom, they say, are some of their most reliable tenants when it comes to paying rent on time.

“The housing authority would bear the brunt of the expense of having to completely evict and go through the court action of having to evict these families,” Sylvia Blanco, the chief operating officer at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin, Texas, told the Times.

“We would be on the hook for having to pay for that,” she added.

The plan would also require public housing administrators to verify the immigration status of every resident every year, they told the Times, as well as issue eviction notices and potentially go through court battles with individual families, according to the Times.

In Austin, legal fees and staff expenses would cost about $1,000 per eviction, Blanco told the newspaper.

In Los Angeles, where at least 30 percent of public housing occupants are households that could be caught in the crosshairs of the policy, the enforcement cost would be nearly $10 million.

“You can imagine, if you’re forcing the eviction of nearly one-third of these very large public housing sites, the impact that has on households as well as the broader community,” Doug Guthrie, the president and chief executive of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, told the Times.

Undocumented immigrants currently live with numerous families receiving housing subsidies, but the assistance is generally pro-rated according to how many members of the family are eligible, according to the Times.

“Most of our members are saying that’s a process that works,” Tim Kaiser, the executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, told the newspaper.

EPA Union: Leaked email from MPCA suppressed EPA's PolyMet concerns,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/2719890-EPA-Union-Leaked-email-from-MPCA-suppressed-EPAs-PolyMet-concerns,"The union representing workers at the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday released an email which they say shows the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency tried to stifle concerns the EPA had on a permit for PolyMet’s proposed copper-nickel mine near Hoyt Lakes, set to be the first of its kind in Minnesota.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents the EPA’s Region 5 employees in Minnesota, sent news organizations a copy of an email sent by then-MPCA Assistant Commissioner Shannon Lotthammer to EPA Region Chief of Staff Kurt Thiede on May 13, 2018. In the email, Lotthammer asked Thiede and the EPA to wait on commenting on a PolyMet draft permit until the public comment period ended.

The union said it obtained the email through an anonymous leak.

“By asking EPA to submit its comments after the public comment period, in whatever form, MPCA was attempting to suppress those comments from public review,” Nicole Cantello, president of AFGE Local 70, said in a news release accompanying the leaked email. “This suppression is completely inappropriate and allowed those comments to remain secret.”

Cantello cited a section of the email where Lotthammer wrote, “We have asked that EPA Region 5 not send a written comment letter during the public comment period and instead follow the steps outlined in the (memorandum of agreement), and wait until we have reviewed and responded to public comments and made associated changes before sending comments from EPA.”

Lotthammer is now the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ assistant commissioner overseeing forestry, parks and trails and operations services.

Lotthammer declined to comment on the leaked email or the union’s response to it when reached via email by the News Tribune Tuesday afternoon. She directed inquiries to MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton.

In a statement, Broton said the MPCA made “substantive changes” to the permit based on numerous conversations between the MPCA and EPA and provided the memorandum of agreement between the MPCA and EPA that Lotthammer referenced in the email to the EPA.

“Today’s released email highlights the long-standing agreement between the EPA and MPCA that gives the state agency the authority to administer the federal permit program for water discharge,” Broton said.

In her email to the EPA, Lotthommer said the memorandum of agreement laid out steps for the EPA and MPCA to follow regarding comments made by both public and other agencies.

“The concern we have expressed to Region 5 staff/mgrs is the timing of EPA comments, not the ability for EPA to comment,” Lotthommer said. She reiterated later: “The question is about the timing of that review , and the importance of maintaining the approach laid out in the (memorandum of agreement) for the sake of clarity and efficiency, among other goals.”

The leaked email comes less than one week after the EPA released documents showing the agency was concerned a draft permit would not meet the Clean Water Act standards unless the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency made substantial changes to the permit and the EPA’s office of inspector general said it would audit the agency’s PolyMet permitting procedures.

EPA concerns over the permit have slowly come to light after Jeffry Fowley, a retired EPA attorney, said multiple people raised concerns with him that the EPA’s concerns and comments on PolyMet’s draft permit were told to the MPCA over the phone instead of in writing, leaving their concerns out of the public record.

“In all of my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley wrote in a sworn declaration to Minnesota Court of Appeals. “There is no legitimate reason why written comments which could be sent would instead be read over the phone.”

For Paula Maccabee, counsel and advocacy director WaterLegacy, an environmental group opposed to the mine that has requested numerous EPA documents on PolyMet’s permit , the leaked email was confirmation of what Fowley had been saying for months.

“It was our hypothesis that the reason why the EPA political leaders suppressed what the career staff had to say was because Minnesota had put pressure on them. But we didn’t have proof, and now we do,” Maccabee said. “And that’s extremely troubling.”"
Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""



Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""



(Evanston Fire Department)

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""

Advocates ask Justice Department to investigate Euclid police over controversial use-of-force incidents,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Evan Macdonald', 'Emacdonald Cleveland.Com']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/06/advocates-ask-justice-department-to-investigate-euclid-police-over-controversial-use-of-force-incidents.html,"EUCLID, Ohio – A legal advocacy group sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday requesting an investigation into the Euclid Police Department over a series of controversies, including an officer’s 2017 beating of a motorist that made national headlines.

The Legal Advocacy and Writ Resources Foundation says in the letter that the request is due to a “pattern of excessive and deadly force, police brutality, and intimidation” that deprives citizens of their rights. The letter lists at least seven events since 2016 that the LAWRS Foundation describes as excessive uses of force by police officers.

The six-page letter is signed by LAWRS Foundation President Cassandra McDonald and addressed to Steven Rosenbaum, the chief of the special litigation section of the Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights.

The Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment about the letter late Tuesday afternoon.

McDonald said she has been considering the request for a Justice Department investigation for roughly three years, and sent the letter Tuesday morning. She acknowledged the Justice Department may decline to investigate Euclid police department, but said she is hoping the letter will help spur reform efforts.

“I’m not hostile toward [Euclid’s] mayor. I’m not hostile toward the [city] council or anyone there. My problem is this has been going on for too long,” she said in a phone interview with cleveland.com.

The city of Euclid and its police department released a joint statement Tuesday afternoon, saying they “welcome full review and will cooperate fully with any investigation.”

Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail’s office did not respond to a request for additional comment. A Euclid police spokesman said the department would not have any further comment beyond the joint statement.

The Euclid Police Department has been at the center of several high-profile controversies in recent years, several of which are listed in the LAWRS Foundation’s letter.

Among those is Euclid patrolman Michael Amiott’s violent arrest of Richard L. Hubbard during an August 2017 traffic stop. Video of the arrest showed Amiott knee Hubbard, tackle him to the ground and punch him in the face and body several times.

The video went viral online, and the city of Euclid fired Amiott in the wake of the incident. But an arbitrator overturned the firing last year and ordered the city to give Amiott’s job back.

Euclid has hired a special prosecutor to review the case and determine whether Amiott should face misdemeanor charges. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley’s office, which declined to charge Amiott with a felony, is also working with U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman’s office to decide whether to pursue federal charges against Amiott.

Hubbard also filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Euclid and its police department, which is pending in federal court.

Also listed in the letter is Euclid officer Matthew Rhodes’ fatal shooting of Luke O. Stewart during a March 2017 incident. Rhodes and his partner found Stewart asleep in a parked car, and Rhodes jumped into the car when Stewart tried to drive away.

Rhodes shot Stewart several times, saying he feared for his life because he felt Stewart may crash. A Cuyahoga County grand jury subsequently declined to bring criminal charges against Rhodes.

A federal judge also determined the shooting was justified when he ruled in Euclid’s favor in a civil lawsuit filed by Stewart’s family. But the judge chastised the Euclid Police Department for its training protocol, saying it exhibited a lackadaisical attitude about use-of-force training.

McDonald said Tuesday that she believes an investigation could lead to changes within the Euclid police department. Among the changes she’s seeking are the formation of a commission, including citizens and government officials, that has subpoena power to conduct its own investigations into controversial incidents.

“It just had to be done,” she said about the letter she sent the Justice Department. “I don’t know what the outcome is going to be, but I think it will put them on further alert.”

The request represents a likely uphill climb since the Trump Administration all but abandoned the Obama-era U.S. Department of Justice Department’s focus on civil-rights issues at local police departments. The city of Cleveland’s police department entered into a federal agreement with the Justice Department in 2015 that mandated reforms throughout the department.

US Treasury yields steady ahead of Federal Reserve meeting,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/17/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"U.S. government debt yields held steady on Monday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision later in the week.

At around 2:19 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slipped to 2.08%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 2.577%.

Market focus began the week centered on the Fed's upcoming policy decision and public comments, with many expecting the U.S. central bank to hold its overnight lending rate steady ahead of a cut in July. Lackluster inflation, modest economic growth expectations and a partial inversion of the yield curve are expected to pressure Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues toward reducing borrowing costs.

But the timing of any Fed rate cut, the first in more than a decade, remains a matter of debate. While some suspect the Fed to reduce interest rates in June or July after May's weak jobs data and softer consumer price index print, others are betting it waits until September to consider more data first.

Still, economists believe the Fed to hint at any future plans to reduce rates through the so-called ""dot plot,"" a chart that anonymously reflect each official's rate forecast.

Expectations for an upcoming rate cut have kept pressure on yields, with the 2-year Treasury note rate down nearly 40 basis points over the last month to 1.87% from 2.23%. Long-term rates like that of the 10-year Treasury note have touched multiyear lows in recent weeks amid equity volatility and demand for fixed-income assets."
Pompeo blocks Saudi inclusion on list of countries that recruit child soldiers: report,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/449105-pompeo-blocked-placement-of-saudi-arabia-on,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense: Shanahan exit shocks Washington | Pentagon left rudderless | Lawmakers want answers on Mideast troop deployment | Senate could vote on Saudi arms deal this week | Pompeo says Trump doesn't want war with Iran Progressive nonprofits sue White House over missing notes from Putin meeting Progressive nonprofits sue White House over missing notes from Putin meeting MORE blocked his agency from including Saudi Arabia on a list of countries that use child soldiers, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Pompeo reportedly intervened to keep the country off the list despite findings by State Department experts that the Saudi-led coalition involved in neighboring Yemen’s civil war has used underage fighters, according to the news service, citing four people familiar with the matter.

Experts at the State Department requested Saudi Arabia’s inclusion based on a combination of news reports and analyses by human rights groups, Reuters reported.

Ultimately, Pompeo sided with other State Department officials who argued it was unclear whether the forces in question, reportedly child fighters from Sudan, were under the command of Sudanese officers or directed by the Saudi coalition, according to the news outlet.

Sudanese fighters told The New York Times in December that their United Arab Emirates and Saudi commanders directed them from a distance in the campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

The U.S. will add Sudan back to the list after removing it last year, according to Reuters. A spokesman for Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces, which has contributed combatants in the Yemen conflict, told Reuters: “Based on Sudanese laws, it does not recruit minors.”

""The United States condemns the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers,"" a State Department spokesperson told The Hill in a statement. ""We place great importance on ending the practice wherever it occurs.""

The Saudi Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.

Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the State Department is required to issue an annual report on countries using child soldiers. No foreign militaries on the list can receive U.S. aid unless the president issues a waiver based on “national interest.”

U.S.-Saudi ties have been under intense scrutiny in recent months due to a combination of concerns about human rights abuses in the Yemen campaign and the murder of Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.

"For U.S. presidents, poker is a main event",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Norman Chad', 'Norman Chad Writes A Syndicated Sports Humor Column.']",06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/for-us-presidents-poker-is-a-main-event/2019/06/16/7a1a5e54-8fb1-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"Columnist

We are in the midst of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, with the world championship $10,000 buy-in Main Event beginning July 3, and in its 50th year this annual festival dwarfs the World Series of Baseball in one very unmistakable manner:

The World Series of Poker is a true world series.

Baseball’s alleged World Series is the championship of the United States and Toronto. The WSOP Main Event is the championship of the world — last year, 83 nations were represented, with 2,116 of the 7,874 entrants from outside the U.S.

Frankly, I would argue — and I am arguing — that in addition to having a great international presence, poker is more of an American game than baseball.

You need look no further than the White House.

Many, many presidents played poker as adults before, during and after their administrations. Of course, no presidents have played adult baseball — though George W. Bush was part-owner of the Texas Rangers for a while — and the only MLB presidential activity is the occasional “throwing out the first pitch” at a game after sometimes getting booed.

Let’s kick-start this column by listing four presidential poker facts — well, three facts and one falsehood. You have to pick the imposter!

(a) Richard Nixon loved playing in the Navy, winning enough to help finance his first congressional campaign.

(b) Rutherford B. Hayes built a “man cave” of sorts on the South Lawn, where he played a Friday night game when Congress was in session.

(c) Dwight Eisenhower loved playing in the Army, winning enough to pay for an engagement ring for Mamie.

(d) Warren Harding liked playing twice a week in office and reputedly once lost an entire set of White House china on a poker bet.

The falsehood? It is (b) — Hayes didn’t even own a deck of cards; well, his wife did.

(Usual disclosure: I have been the “color commentator” for ESPN’s World Series of Poker telecasts since 2003 despite knowing very little about poker or broadcasting, joined by my partner Lon McEachern, who also knows very little about cards or TV. We are proof you can fail upward in America, or get elected.)

Among the other presidents who played poker were Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Barack Obama.

Harding’s advisers played so often with the boss, they were known as the “Poker Cabinet.”

FDR played a regular nickel-ante game in the White House study. His favorite stud games were one-eyed jacks wild and “Woolworth’s,” in which fives and tens were wild.

(Note to readers — or to my reader — under the age of 30: Woolworth’s was a “five-and-dime” department store in the 20th century.)

Truman’s motto, “The buck stops here,” was actually a poker expression; in the 19th century, hunting knives with buckhorn handles were used as the dealer button.

On March 4, 1946, Truman and Winston Churchill played poker on the presidential train en route to Fulton, Mo. Churchill had five Scotches before the game even began, lost $250 and gave up at 2:30 a.m. — he needed to sober up for his famous Iron Curtain speech the next day and needed to sober up for the Cold War.

Which reminds me — in 1271, Kublai Khan’s chief of staff check-raised the emperor at a home game, and the poor sap was working port authority at the Black Sea within a week.*

(*This is probably a falsehood.)

Our current POTUS, Donald Trump, does not play poker. But he created the U.S. Poker Championship for his Trump Taj Mahal casino in 1998, another one of his myriad business failures, held annually until 2010.

As part of ESPN’s coverage of the event in 2006, Trump offered “Trump’s Power Tips” coming out of commercial breaks.

Here was one of them:

“When somebody challenges you, fight back. Don’t let them push you around. Don’t be a sucker. Fight back 10 times harder than they ever thought. Guess what? They’ll never play games with you again.”

I guess he wasn’t bluffing.
