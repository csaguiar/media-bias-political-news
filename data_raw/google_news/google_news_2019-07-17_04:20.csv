CNN Invites White Supremacist Richard Spencer to Talk About Trump’s Racist Tweets,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Kelly Weill', 'Justin Baragona']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-invites-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-to-talk-about-trumps-racist-tweets,"CNN interviewed white supremacist Richard Spencer during a Tuesday segment on President Donald Trump’s racist tweets, in another example of a news outlet normalizing far-right radicals by giving them a mainstream platform.

The segment on Jake Tapper’s The Lead covered neo-Nazis’ support for Trump’s racist attacks on four progressive congresswomen of color. The spot included an interview with Spencer who said Trump is playing a “con game” and that his attacks were not racist enough.

“He gives us nothing outside of racist tweets,” he said. “And by racist tweets, I mean tweets that are meaningless and cheap and express the kind of sentiments you might hear from your drunk uncle while he’s watching [Sean] Hannity.”

CNN correspondent Sara Sidner also interviewed Joanna Mendelson, a senior investigative reporter at the Anti-Defamation League, who spoke about the effect of Trump’s racist tweets.

“Essentially, it normalizes hate and it makes it acceptable,” Mendelson said of the tweets.

Indeed, Spencer shared the CNN segment on his Twitter account shortly after it aired.

“The CNN anchors didn't understand that Spencer was trying to position Trump as a moderate and to mock other white supremacists who supported Trump,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. “Spencer was saying that Trump was performing racism on Twitter, but that his policies do not go far enough to be considered support for white supremacists goals.”

CNN and Sidner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Tapper tweeted that Sidner “covers racists and white supremacists for us (among other subjects) and does a great job. She did a taped package for cnn about the reaction of white supremacists to the president’s tweets.”

Spencer is an open white nationalist who advocates for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” Spencer was a key player and featured speaker at Unite the Right, the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a neo-Nazi murdered an anti-racist protester. (Spencer is currently being sued over the event.) Open neo-Nazi groups like the Traditionalist Worker Party have provided security at his events. He has repeatedly invoked Nazi slogans and imagery, including calling media the “lügenpresse” (""lying press"") and leading a Hitler-type salute of Trump. Spencer is so racist h is banned from most countries in Europe.

Spencer has also been accused of domestic abuse, allegedly beating his estranged wife throughout their relationship, including while she was pregnant, accusations he denies.

Academics have cautioned against offering white supremacists wide exposure, such as on-air interviews in slick studios.

“Spencer will turn this into a new wave of attention within his own media ecosystem, where CNN has now just legitimated a litany of white supremacists, many of who were relegated to online obscurity,” said Donovan.

CNN is the most-recent mainstream news outlet to struggle with how to handle the outsized stature of the racist far right since they leapt to support Trump beginning during his presidential campaign. Last year, NBC’s Today show hosted the leader of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, who repeated the group’s recruitment talking points. In 2016, Mother Jones ran a heavily criticized article describing Spencer as “dapper” in the headline. The New York Times ran a similarly soft-focused article on Tony Hovater as a harmless young man from the Midwest despite his membership in the violent Traditionalist Worker Party.

The Painful Roots of Trump’s ‘Go Back’ Comment,https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/aoc-trump-tlaib-omar-pressley.html,"It was there in 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act sought to curb the number of Chinese workers and families entering the United States to find day-labor work, from building railroads to doing laundry. And it was there in the 1840s, when anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment in the United States led to the creation of a nativist political party designed to weed out foreign influence.

One of the prime examples of the “go back” sentiment has roots in the American Colonization Society, a white-led organization that sought to send freed slaves back to Africa. Fodei Batty, an assistant professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, wrote in a 2016 Washington Post analysis that some freed slaves went willingly because they were “disillusioned with the prospects of racial equality in America,” while others who wanted to stay argued that the effort to resettle slaves was a thinly veiled way to purge the United States of black people.

Descendants of those who stayed, Mr. Batty said in an interview, are now familiar with the sort of knee-jerk “go back” slur meant to immediately single out someone from a group where one trait — usually whiteness — is the default.

“You’re making this claim only to adopt a sense of place,” Mr. Batty said, “to put someone in a sense of place and give a sense of the other, that someone is different, without even having an understanding of the implications of those words.”

For African-Americans, the idea of returning to Africa, originally advocated by some whites as a better alternative than servitude, now persists as an angry slur. Outside a Trump rally in Cleveland in 2016, a man was filmed shouting “go back to Africa” at a black woman who was there to protest Mr. Trump.

“Y’all brought us here,” the woman retorted.

From the 4,800 responses The Times received, a common theme seemed to be encountering the slur when speaking up in white spaces, with the targets not limited to African-Americans. Samantha Edwards, a 47-year-old administrative assistant who grew up in Las Vegas, also wrote to The Times to share her story.

In the mid-1990s, she said she and her mother were chased out of a restaurant by two white men who screamed at them to “go back to Mexico.” She said she and her mother had been speaking together in English before the men chased them. Ms. Edwards, who was born in the United States but is of Mexican descent, said her parents avoided teaching her Spanish so she could avoid some of the discrimination they felt."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The House formally condemned President Donald Trump’s Twitter posts as racist on Tuesday – in a vote split largely along party lines despite pressure for Republicans to denounce the president’s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color that they should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The vote on the resolution condemning a series of Trump’s remarks and Twitter posts came after a dramatic and combative hours-long debate that hit several snags due to long-standing House rules that prohibit any personal attacks on the president.

The vote, 240-187, fell nearly entirely along party lines with only four Republicans voting with Democrats. The four Republicans lawmakers are: Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently left the GOP to become an independent, also voted in support of the resolution.

The resolution specifically called Trump's comments about ""The Squad"" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — ""racist"" and says the attacks have ""legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.""

Everything we know: Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad.'

The vote put Republicans on the record as to whether they denounced the president's comments or stuck beside him. Throughout Tuesday's debates Democrats aimed to pressure Republicans to hold Trump accountable while Republicans resisted, denouncing the resolution as a political ploy.

The intense debate over the president's rhetoric led to the House halting proceedings for nearly two hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments “racist” and a top Republican asked her remarks be taken down.

""These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist,"" Pelosi said. ""Every single member of this institution — Democratic and Republican — should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.""

Editorial: Trump's racist rants are too offensive to overlook

As Pelosi called the president’s tweets racist, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., tried to interrupt and cut off her speech. Pelosi only spoke louder, looking down at her prepared remarks.

After Pelosi was done, Collins looked wide-eyed at Pelosi and asked if she wanted to ""rephrase that comment."" Pelosi shot back: ""I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them."" House Democrats started cheering and clapping.

The move led to two hours of delay as officials debated over whether Pelosi violated House rules, which the House ruled she had. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who was presiding over the House floor at the time, abdicated his post due to the dramatic fighting on both sides.

""We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate. That’s what this is,” he said, noting that he tried to remain fair. But, he said. “fairness isn’t enough. We want to just fight.""

“I’ll abandon the chair,” Cleaver said, slamming the gavel on the dais and storming away as House officials watched in amazement.

The moment was replayed on loop on C-SPAN like a moment from an NFL game with reporters left with their jaws dropped remarking aloud whether this had happened before. A large crowd of journalists gathered in the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the debate.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and chairman of the House Rules Committee, also got in a heated back-and-forth with Republicans after he attacked the president's comments in a speech as something that ""used to be reserved for the darkest corners of the internet.""

""This is proudly using Twitter as a megaphone to attack fellow Americans,"" he said. ""These are American citizens being turned into some kind of scary 'other,' not because of their party, but because of their background, their race and their opinions.""

He added: ""I implore my colleagues to think twice before you follow the president off a cliff.""

Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga., took issue with McGovern's comments, saying they clearly violated rules and were ""diminishing"" the institution of the House of Representatives.

Pelosi told members of her caucus Tuesday morning she wasn't worried about House rules on calling out the president's comments, describing the four congresswomen as their ""sisters"" and saying Trump's ""words were racist,"" according to an aide in the room.

She added that she hoped Republicans would join them in condemning the comments by voting in a bipartisan fashion for the resolution.

""If they can’t support condemning the words of the President, well that’s a message in and of itself,"" Pelosi said, according to the source.

Most Republicans did not condemn the president and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate refused to do so throughout the day Tuesday, alleging the outcry is over politics.

“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” said GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy. “This is all about politics and beliefs of ideologies.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to call the comments racist and specifically said ""the president's not a racist.""

""Our words do matter. We all know politics is a contact sport. But it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board,"" said McConnell, R-Ky. ""All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse.""

After Tuesday's vote, Republicans said they felt the day was wasted talking about the president instead of working to settle issues that will help the American people.

""This resolution divides our nation and distracts us from addressing the issues the American people sent us here to solve,"" Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said. ""It's time House Democrats start focusing on the real problems facing the American people, instead of their own.""

CLOSE Four congresswomen reacted to President Donald Trump seemingly suggesting they ""go back"" to the countries they ""originally came from"". USA TODAY

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said the debate and chaos the resolution caused on the House floor left him ""struggling."" He said, to him, this debate ""is not about race.""

""It should be about the issues that we disagree on, trying to come together and find common ground,"" Newhouse said. ""That’s what I’m looking forward to try to find some respectful discourse and some civility out of all this.""

Along with the resolution, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., introduced a measure that would censure Trump for his racist comments. Democrats aren't expected to take up the measure for a vote, instead hoping the resolution on Tuesday would garner bipartisan support.

Trump wrote on Sunday that it was ""so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" now telling the U.S. how to run its government. He did not mention Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley or Tlaib by name.

""Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Then come back and show us how it is done.""

All four are American citizens. The four progressive freshmen lawmakers are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as ""The Squad"" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.

The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.

The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of ""The Squad,"" telling New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the four congresswomen ""have their public whatever and their Twitter world"" but do not ""have any following.""

Ocasio-Cortez questioned why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was ""outright disrespectful.""

The back-and-forth digs ended over the weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.

The resolution not only condemns Trump's comments. It also highlights immigration as a centerpiece of American history and culture, quoting presidents throughout history and comparing them to the policies of the Trump administration, which has been heavily scrutinized due in part to the worsening conditions in migrant detention centers at the southern U.S. border.

""The commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents,"" the resolution reads. ""American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good.""

‘The D.O.J. Has Failed Us’: Eric Garner’s Family Assails Prosecutors,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Otterman'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/eric-garner-justice-department-charges.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

The family members and supporters of Eric Garner had a message for New York City and the Justice Department on Tuesday: It’s not over.

In two emotional news conferences, Mr. Garner’s family, elected officials and civil rights leaders denounced the decision by federal prosecutors not to bring criminal civil rights charges against the New York City police officer who used a chokehold on Mr. Garner in the moments before he stopped breathing.

“The D.O.J. has failed us,” Mr. Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, said on Tuesday morning. “Five years ago, my son said ‘I can’t breathe’ 11 times. Today we can’t breathe. Because they have let us down.”"
Bureau of Land Management to move headquarters from DC to Colorado,https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453321-bureau-of-land-management-to-move-headquarters-from-dc-to-colorado,"The Trump administration plans to relocate the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from Washington, D.C., to Colorado, according to two lawmakers.

The reorganization, first considered under former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkePress: Acosta, latest to walk the plank Senior Trump administration official to leave post next week 2020 Democrats vow to get tough on lobbyists MORE, is aimed at putting more agency officials closer to the lands they manage out West, though critics have questioned moving tenured policy officials far from the nation's capital.

Currently only about 4 percent of BLM employees live in D.C., but the proposal would shrink that number even further, leaving just 60 of the nearly 400 BLM employees in the nation’s capital, according to a letter from Interior to a Republican lawmaker dated Tuesday, obtained by The Hill.

Just 27 employees will be moved to the new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., with the rest divided among the western states of Utah, Nevada and other existing local offices, according to the document.

Since BLM has nearly 10,000 employees, the reorganization plans would effectively move the agency entirely out of D.C.

Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner Cory Scott GardnerBottom Line Congress mobilizes on cyber threats to electric grid The Hill's Morning Report - 2020 jitters hit both parties in the Senate MORE (R) confirmed the headquarters move on Monday, calling it a “significant win” for his state.

“This means that people will be able to have greater say, greater impact on public lands decisions that affect their community,” Gardner said in a video he tweeted.

“This is an effort I started years ago under the Obama administration so that we could have the policymakers in Washington closer to the people that are most impacted by the decisions that Washington makes.”

The Department of Interior, which oversees BLM, did not respond to requests for comment or details about the plan. The agency is expected to make an announcement later Tuesday.

Democratic lawmakers criticized the administration for failing to alert them earlier of the planned move, which is expected to affect BLM managers and other agency officials.

“This administration has been handing over public lands to fossil fuel companies at record speed, and this move is part of that agenda. Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s home town just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.

“The BLM officials based in Washington are here to work directly with Congress and their federal colleagues, and that function is going to take a permanent hit if this move goes forward. The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt often failed to provide any details about the move when pushed by lawmakers, typically saying the decision began under Zinke and was still being reviewed. Bernhardt is originally from Rifle, Colo., about 60 miles east of Grand Junction.

“We’ve been asking questions for more than a year about what they’re planning, who and what infrastructure they’re moving, how much this will cost, how they justify it, what impacts they expect on agency missions, etc,” said a senior Democratic staffer on the committee.

“They’ve refused to answer any of those questions.”

However, it’s unclear how much approval from Congress is necessary for the administration to continue with its plans.

The BLM headquarters move could be the first of many reorganizational plans within the Department of Interior. Zinke first announced in January 2018 plans to overhaul the department, arguing that too many bureaucrats lead from Washington rather than the areas they are regulating. His plan, announced last August, would reorganize management of the department through 12 ecosystem and watershed boundaries rather than state lines in what will be called Unified Regions.

The plans have yet to take root, but Bernhardt has indicated they are forthcoming.

Grand Junction sits outside of Colorado National Monument preserves, which spills across the western border into Utah. The town has an estimated population of a little over 63,000. Most of the area surrounding Grand Junction is public land managed by BLM. The town already has a large percentage of government employment, ranging from the school district to the county and city, according to a report from Grand Junction.

The decision to move West comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams. The Environmental Protection Agency has moved employees around several of its offices outside of D.C., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave more than 500 employees until Monday to decide whether to move to the Kansas City area.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."

Mnuchin made his remarks at a press conference on July 15.

Mnuchin called the use of cryptocurrencies to fund illicit activity a national security issue, saying that billions of dollars have been used for this purpose:

“Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, randomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking […] This is indeed a national security issue.”

In response to a question from the press, Mnuchin further commented on the ostensible role of crypto as a means to finance crime, saying:

“I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

Secretary Mnuchin also echoed the Presidents’ latest Twitter posts on cryptocurrencies, saying: “As the President has said: ‘Bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air’” and “Treasury takes very seriously the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, President Trump tweeted out a series of anti-crypto and anti-Bitcoin remarks on July 12, following his “Social Media Summit” for conservative personalities. Trump remarked that the value of crypto is “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they can “facilitate unlawful behavior.”

According to Mnuchin, the Treasury has stressed — to Facebook and Bitcoin (BTC) users among others — that digital financial services are bound by the same Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism policies as traditional institutions such as banks.

Additionally, he said that any crypto transmitters must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): a bureau of the Treasury. FinCEN is the federal regulator that implements the BSA in practice, and has authority over all money service transmitters — including cryptocurrency projects such as Libra.

Mnuchin also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Working Group on Digital Assets, which reportedly includes key regulatory players such as the SEC, CFTC, and the Fed in addition to FinCEN. The idea of this group is to mitigate purported regulatory risks associated with cryptocurrencies."
"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Presidential historian: Trump now with Andrew Johnson as 'most racist president in American history',https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/453240-presidential-historian-trump-now-with-andrew-johnson-as-most-racist,"Presidential historian Jon Meacham said Monday that President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE's latest attacks against a group of minority congresswomen placed him alongside former President Andrew Johnson as the ""most racist president in American history.""

""What the president’s done here is yet again, because I think he did it after Charlottesville, and I think he did it frankly when he was pushing the birther lie about President Obama, is he has joined Andrew Johnson as the most racist president in American history,"" Meacham, who has written biographies on past presidents Thomas Jefferson and George H.W. Bush, said on MSNBC's ""Hardball.""

Meacham described the 17th president's history with racism, noting that Johnson once said in a state message that ""African Americans were incapable of self government and relapsed into barbarism if they weren’t closely supervised.""

The historian drew the parallels between Trump and Johnson one day after Trump targeted four freshman House lawmakers, saying that they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" before speaking out about how the United States government should be run.

Trump also claimed that the progressive Democrats ""came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.""

He did not identify the lawmakers in his tweet, but the comments were aimed at Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.). The four addressed the comments in a press conference on Monday. Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia, is the only one among the four who was born in a foreign country.

Several Democratic lawmakers, as well as multiple GOP congressmen, have derided the comments as xenophobic and racist. House Democrats on Monday introduced a formal resolution to condemn Trump's remarks.

Meacham, a frequent critic of Trump, said Monday that the president's remarks contradicted the ""journey"" of the United States.

""It’s long been said, and President Reagan said it quite well, that America is the one place on earth that is not about a birthright,"" he said. ''It’s about the ascent to an idea, an idea that was written in one of the most important sentences ever written in the English language, that all men were created equal and were endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.

""We didn't apply that fully then. We haven't applied that fully now. But that journey toward a more perfect union is the story of the country.""

Trump has stood by his remarks about the progressive Democrats, stating that the lawmakers should leave the country if they are not ""happy."""
"Jay Inslee promises secretary of state job to Megan Rapinoe, making himself into a joke",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/jay-inslee-promises-secretary-of-state-job-to-megan-rapinoe-making-himself-into-a-joke,"Speaking at the left-wing Netroots Nation last weekend, 2020 Democratic presidential aspirant Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, turned himself into a joke candidate.

Asked about how he would repair alliances that have been frayed by the Trump administration (a legitimate discussion point), Inslee said that if elected, he would ask Megan Rapinoe to be his secretary of state.

Yes, that Megan Rapinoe, the U.S. women's national team soccer star.

One of Inslee's fellow panelists congratulated him ""well played, well played!"", but his suggestion represents sad absurdity. Sad because Inslee's suggestion degrades U.S. foreign policy to base partisan point-scoring. Absurd because Rapinoe has shown zero indication of being equipped with the knowledge and temperament necessary to serve as America's chief diplomat.

Inslee claims that Rapinoe offers us ""more love rather than hate"" and that ""what she has said that has inspired us so much is such an antithesis of the president's foreign policy."" Really? Rapinoe is an exceptional athlete, and she has every right to protest the anthem. But she isn't exactly a diplomat-in-waiting, let alone the most obvious prospect to lead America's diplomatic service.

The soccer star has the very opposite of a diplomatic temperament. She is quick to launch scathing and profanity-laced attacks on people she disagrees with or dislikes, prone to emotional outbursts, and somewhat arrogant. True, all those things apply in equal if not greater measure to President Trump. But Trump at least has appointed two informed, experienced, and tempered individuals as secretary of state. What message would Rapinoe's appointment send to the men and women of the State Department? That the president of the United States regards his diplomats and civil service officers only as a useful prop for some kind of far-left public relations.

Moreover, at a time where Russia increasingly threatens NATO security, China is trying to replace the U.S.-led international order, Iran is threatening conflict, Saudi Arabia is led by an emotional prince, the European Union is in strife, and Indian power is rising rapidly, we might just want to have a qualified candidate in Foggy Bottom.

Rapinoe is a great soccer player. I hope she keeps representing America. But Inslee makes himself a joke by promoting her as a prospective secretary of state.

Then again, perhaps he was just looking for some free media coverage?"

A government watchdog said Monday the Environmental Protection Agency did not follow its own guidelines when filling two key science advisory panels with fewer academic researchers and more industry voices.

The findings from the Government Accountability Office, published Monday at the request of several Senate Democrats, provide additional fodder for critics who say President Trump's deputies are trying to degrade the way EPA assesses scientific research. Both panels are part of the EPA and made up of scientists from outside the agency who advise it on the best science surrounding issues like air pollution, pesticides and hazardous waste.

The agency itself disputes the watchdog's findings, arguing in a letter submitted to the GAO that its way of choosing new panelists for the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee is “more rigorous” than under the EPA's old guidelines.

The GAO described a sharp decrease in the number of university researchers serving on the Science Advisory Board, which reviews the integrity of scientific information used by the EPA when writing rules, over the first 15 months of the Trump administration. The number of university researchers on the panel went from 36 in January 2017 to just 22 in March 2018. The panel had between 44 and 47 members during that period.

The decrease came as the number of researchers from consulting firms or from companies regulated by the agency went up, a fact that Democrats latched onto as more evidence the Trump adminisitration is overly influenced by polluting industries.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led a group of Democrats in asking the GAO to investigate the agency's practices. “This is not a trivial issue, but a serious problem that has profound consequences for enforcement and regulatory actions across the agency.”

Among those who under Trump joined the Science Advisory Board are Brant Ulsh, a health physicist at M.H. Chew & Associates who has argued the EPA has overplayed the risk of small doses of radiation; and John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville whose work critical of NASA's climate scientists has been often cited by so-called climate “skeptics.”

The watchdog agency found fewer ""notable"" changes to the composition of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.

That decrease in academics on the Science Advisory Board is due largely to a Trump administration policy barring scientists who get EPA grants from serving as advisers, according to Genna Reed, a science and policy analyst in the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“It's a pretty clear connection to draw,” she said. The ban, put in place by former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, drew praise from industry lobbying groups and condemnation from scientific organizations such as Reed's when it was announced in 2017.

According to the GAO, in the past agency staffers weighed in with written recommendations on who should be selected for these two boards. That part of the selection process was spelled out in one of the EPA's own handbooks.

But in the Trump administration, officials ignored those internal guidelines and chose advisers without much of a paper trail. Instead of written recommendations, EPA management instead requested briefings with staffers.

“That was our key finding: The EPA didn't follow this key step with these two committees,” said J. Alfredo Gomez, director of the GAO's natural resources and environment team.

In the past, EPA head Andrew Wheeler cast the panel appointments as an effort to gather scientific opinions from a diverse set of voices. But when selecting researchers for the Science Advisory Board, there is one region of the country the Trump administration seems to turn to frequently: the South.

At the start of the administration, about a quarter, or 28 percent, of the panel hailed from the generally conservative region, which spanned Delaware to Texas in the GAO's analysis. About 15 months later, Southerners constituted more than half of the board.

One of the newcomers is Michael Honeycutt, the top toxicologist in the state of Texas who in 2017 was chosen to chair the Science Advisory Board and who has accused the agency of “overstating” the risks associated with mercury, a toxic heavy metal that can cause brain damage.

In a letter commenting on a draft of the GAO report, the EPA urged the watchdog to delete from the final version the conclusion that EPA ignored its own rules when selecting members of the panels because it is within Wheeler's authority to set new guidance.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy — the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud wrote in an email Monday.

The GAO acknowledged Wheeler had that discretion, but ultimately recommended that the EPA follow the handbook's guidelines.

— Another agency is moving staff out of Washington: The Interior Department is planning to yank most of the Bureau of Land Management’s Washington-based employees out of the District and move them out West. Some top employees are set to be transferred to Grand Junction, Colo., and others will move to other cities, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Lisa Rein report.

The context: “The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government,” they write. “Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.""

Two sides to the argument: In a statement supporting the move, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the “problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve... Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,” he added. Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 told Rein and Eilperin: “If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook … It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.”

Under the plan (I got additional details last night), Utah will get several dozen jobs, as will Nevada and Colorado. More than 80 percent of headquarters jobs will move West. https://t.co/rddUkHXdTY — Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) July 16, 2019

THERMOMETER

— Tracking the deluge from Barry: There were rainfall totals reaching 15 inches in parts of Louisiana on Monday, as the impact of tropical depression Barry poured down on the state, though later than anticipated, The Post's Jason Samenow reports. “Since late last week, forecasters said Barry would be a drawn-out event, with heavy rain a threat lasting two to three days. But the worst was expected over the weekend, when meteorologists predicted tremendous amounts of rain in Louisiana. Rivers were forecast to surge to historic heights,” he writes.

Still, more rain is yet to come: “Dangerous, significant flash flooding is likely, especially across south-central Louisiana,” the National Weather Service wrote in a statement. Samenow adds the agency is predicting “five to eight inches more of rain in this area through the afternoon and rainfall rates as high as two to four inches per hour.”

— This climate scientist is also an evangelical Christian, and she’s trying to persuade skeptics: Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist, has found a way to talk to people about science by talking to them about faith, The Post’s Dan Zak writes in this profile of the Texas Tech University researcher. During a keynote address at the Citizens’ Climate Lobby conference in Washington, Hayhoe — who is also a lead author on the U.S. government’s latest National Climate Assessment — displayed an ability to communicate that seems “miraculous by the standards of modern climate politics: She can convert nonbelievers — or, to put it in her terms, make people realize that they’ve believed in the importance of this issue all along,” Zak writes. “She knows how to speak to oilmen, to Christians, to farmers and ranchers, having lived for years in Lubbock, Tex., with her pastor husband. She is a scientist who thinks that we’ve talked enough about science, that we need to talk more about matters of the heart.” “We humans have been given responsibility for every living thing on this planet, which includes each other,” she said at the conference. “We are called to tend the garden and be good stewards of the gifts that God has given us.”

— How extreme heat is changing sports: Scientists say the hottest places on the planet are getting hotter, faster. Las Vegas, for example, the location of an annual race called Running with the Devil, is the “fastest-warming city in the country and has seen an average temperature increase of nearly 6 degrees since 1970,” The Post’s Rick Maese reports in the latest piece in a series on how climate change is affecting the world of sports. “The Running with the Devil race, intentionally scheduled for extreme conditions, might not be an exact peek into the future, but it does highlight many of the challenges already confronting much of the sports world. How does heat affect performance? What dangers lurk on the outdoor courses and fields exposed to the summer sun? How does one stage a safe event in extreme conditions?”

— Man, it’s a hot one: Last month was the Earth’s hottest June on record, 1.7 degrees above the norm for the global average temperature for the month, according to data from NASA. “The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets,” The Post’s Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report. “NASA is the second institution to confirm that it was Earth’s hottest June, as the Copernicus Climate Change Service had already determined that June 2019 was the warmest such month on record for Europe and globally.”

— No word on what caused New York City’s blackout: Con Edison warned the city could see more power outages this summer after a weekend power failure left 73,000 residents in the dark. “We expect that there could be service outages — those things happen during heat waves,” the power company’s chief spokesman, Mike Clendenin, said in an interview with PIX 11, according to the New York Post. He also said there’s still no explanation for what caused the blackout. “We are very, very focused on examining exactly what transpired and caused that outage,” Clendenin said. ““There’s a lot of patience and poise that New Yorkers displayed during the outage itself. The same kind of patience and diligence is going to be needed as engineers and experts dive into the date and actually analyze how equipment tripped off, or what went wrong, that led to the large outage.”

Meanwhile, in Washington: ""Power was cut off Monday night to as many as 7,000 homes and businesses in the District, many of them in Northeast, near Capitol Hill according to Pepco,"" The Post's Martin Weil reports. ""The utility said it had issues with equipment at a substation in Northeast.""

The State Department is raising concerns about the arrest and detention of an American rapper in Sweden and is urging the Swedish government to treat him fairly, according to a statement shared exclusively with POLITICO.

ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested July 2 after voluntarily going to the police in Stockholm for questioning about a street fight he was involved in.

Story Continued Below

A State Department spokesperson said that the department is aware of the case and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been briefed. Top officials at the department, including Robert O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, are also closely monitoring the situation and working to make sure the rapper is treated fairly.

“There are certainly some facts about the arrest and detention that raise concerns,” the spokesperson said. “We expect all governments, including Sweden, to treat American citizens fairly and with respect. … We hope to see ASAP Rocky and his colleagues back on tour and reunited with friends and family soon.”

Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge Rocky, who is being held in solitary confinement, or ask a court to let them hold him longer.

Rocky and his entourage, who were in Stockholm for the Smash music festival, were walking around the city “minding their own business” on June 30 when they were verbally harassed by two men who had started following them, according to a person close to the rapper.

Eventually, after one of them took “a fighting stance and then threw a punch” at Rocky’s bodyguard and hit him, the two sides soon started fighting.

“They were obviously spoiling for a fight,” said the person close to Rocky. The person added that the rapper and his crew “had no choice but to defend themselves” and that the two men who had been accosting Rocky and his colleagues got physical first. The person also said Rocky is “eager to defend himself and his name” in court if charges are filed.

A TMZ video shows Rocky throwing across the street one of the men who had been following him and his entourage. The video also shows some members of Rocky’s group kicking and hitting the person.

Rocky posted a video on Instagram with his side of the story, which showed his bodyguard telling the men to quit following them.

“So a few drug addicts are not my fans, we dont know these guys and we didnt want trouble, they followed us for 4 blocks, and they were slapping girls butts who passed, give me a break,” he wrote. Another video Rocky posted shows one of the men fighting with his bodyguard and throwing his headphones at him.

Alan Jackson, a lawyer for Rocky, told POLITICO: “President Trump has made bringing home unjustly held Americans a top priority for his administration. The State Department’s interest in the case gives us great hope for Rocky’s situation.

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador O’Brien have been relentless in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of American citizens being held all over the world. Rocky’s millions of fans worldwide are putting their trust in the State Department to get Rocky home.”

Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requires signatory countries to immediately notify consular officials upon arresting a foreign citizen, but that didn’t happen for hours in Rocky’s case, according to the person close to Rocky.

A State Department official was also initially denied access to Rocky but upon being granted access, the official couldn’t have a private conversation with the rapper because two Swedish security guards were within earshot.

The Swedish Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Rocky was initially held for four days in a facility that had “relatively fetid conditions” with a “terrible stench” that was “dirty, filthy and disgusting,” according to the person close to the rapper. He was later moved to a detention facility where the conditions are “markedly better.”

Celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, sent out social media posts in support of Rocky, and more than 580,000 people have signed a ""#JusticeForRocky"" petition on Change.org to urge Sweden to release him.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose district includes Harlem, where Rocky is from, said he’d “seen the tape of what occurred, and clearly, he was provoked, and harassed, and followed, and accosted, and I think he acted in self-defense.” Espaillat also raised concerns about the conditions of Rocky’s jail and told Complex.com that he would “fight until he’s brought back home.” The lawmaker has sent letters on the case to the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and the Swedish ambassador to the U.S., Karin Olofsdotter."
Education Department ruling a win for cosmetology schools and students,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/education-department-ruling-a-win-for-cosmetology-schools-and-students,"The cosmetology industry is among the fastest growing sectors in our economy because millions of Americans have come to rely on experienced, licensed cosmetologists every day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the industry is expected to grow nearly twice as fast as the national average, by over 13% in the next few years. In 2016 alone, it generated more than $84 billion in revenue, which has helped to support workers and communities across the country.

That record of success and continued growth has been at great risk because of the Obama-era “Gainful Employment” rule. This rule could have forced cosmetology school closures across the country. This would have created a ripple effect of unintended consequences for schools, students, spas, and salons, as well as millions of Americans who rely on skilled, licensed cosmetologists every day.

Fortunately, students, schools, and consumers achieved an important win recently when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the rule, based on its flawed construction and the inaccurate data that had been used to grade cosmetology programs.

Gainful Employment was first implemented to measure schools' success by comparing their students' debt to their presumed income after graduation. While seemingly well intentioned, the rule’s framework serves as a warning of what happens when rulemaking does not account for real-world situations.

When it came to the cosmetology industry, the rule failed to take into account a number of critical factors, including the underreporting of wages and tips. It’s well known that much like the restaurant industry, many transactions in the cosmetology industry are made in cash. As a result of underreported tips, the Gainful Employment scores of cosmetology schools were being significantly skewed.

Despite these known inaccuracies, the Education Department continued to use this metric with devastating consequences. If a school program failed, it faced ineligibility for federal aid. Students would no longer be able to use financial aid to pay for their education, ultimately forcing them to withdraw or pay out-of-pocket.

American Association of Cosmetology School members have always supported strengthening transparency in the higher education system and ensuring students can make the best choice possible for their own futures. But from day one, the association made clear that this rule was not only flawed but also had the potential to seriously damage and possibly close hundreds of reputable cosmetology schools. Even the IRS recognized how problematic the underreporting of wages and tips were on accurately measuring a school’s score.

When other efforts failed, the association filed a lawsuit against the Education Department and won. But it still left an uneven playing field across our educational institutions with an unfair advantage given to nonprofit schools.

That is because in reality, this rule did nothing more than target schools based on their tax status. According to Forbes, in 2016, only 16% of all students were actually enrolled in a program covered by the Gainful Employment rule. This means that roughly 80% of all college students were exempt from these standards. Moreover, cosmetology programs often take a year or less to complete and cost approximately $18,000, with average debt less than $10,000, significantly less than traditional four-year schools. In contrast, private, nonprofit schools average $35,000 per year.

All schools should be held to the highest standards, but those standards should be applied fairly across the board to create a level playing field.

As an industry, we believe that holding institutions of higher education to the highest standards, and ensuring students and parents have all the necessary information to make informed enrollment and borrowing choices is vital to the long-term success of both students and our schools. America’s cosmetology schools applaud Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education for ending this harmful regulation and protecting schools, students, and consumers.

Kathy Chow is the executive director of the American Association of Cosmetology Schools, representing over 600 cosmetology schools and nearly 300 school owners across the nation."
Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeScientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area Federal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."
DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

""What they were probably trying to get Trump to do was say something publicly, tweet something ... probably their best dream was for him to fire Mueller ... and then you'd have public sympathy and public support"" for action against Trump.

Dogs deserve better than brutal VA research that wastes money better spent on veterans,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Dina Titus', 'Brian Mast', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/16/veterans-affairs-dog-testing-brutal-shameful-must-stop-column/1733380001/,"CLOSE

The VA has done these barbaric tests for decades with no discernible benefits in many years. It should stop hurting dogs and start helping veterans.

Few members of the public are aware that the federal government uses taxpayer money to hurt puppies in painful and unnecessary lab experiments.

At the Richmond Veterans Affairs Hospital, where most of the VA’s dog testing takes place, puppies are given heart attacks by injecting latex into their arteries. The dogs are then put on treadmills to stress their compromised hearts, and they are ultimately killed and dissected.

These and other cruel practices must end.

We’ve been leading the charge against this government-funded animal abuse. Our efforts have focused on the Department of Veterans Affairs, where hounds and beagles are subjected to deadly experiments. Though the department has conducted these barbaric tests for decades, the research has not resulted in any discernible benefits for veterans in many years.

VA experiments stopped in many cities

The good news is that we’re making significant progress to end the VA’s canine cruelty. Today there are just a few ongoing dog experiments thanks to pressure from grassroots advocates, sharp media scrutiny and congressional action. In Los Angeles, the VA has stopped injecting Dobermans with methamphetamines; in Milwaukee, the VA has put an end to several painful and invasive experiments on beagles. And in Cleveland, the VA just stopped severing the spinal cords of puppies in deadly tests.

A dog's nose and a single step: On K9 Veterans Day, honor heroic military working dogs for saving soldiers' lives

Now there’s momentum to completely end this antiquated program once and for all. At our urging, the House has passed legislation this year that cuts all funding for painful dog experiments, and our bipartisan bill to permanently end VA dog testing — the Preventing Unkind and Painful Procedures and Experiments on Respected Species (PUPPERS) Act — now has over 100 co-sponsors, including 17 veterans.

Eliminating dog testing within reach

We’re optimistic because there is growing recognition that VA’s dog testing is outdated and unnecessary:

► Earlier this year, due to pressure from Congress and advocates, the VA committed $2 million to develop alternatives to its disgraceful heart attack tests on dogs.

► In May, a spinal cord injury researcher from the University of Miami told a VA-commissioned panel that dog use for spinal cord research like the tests that were being done in Cleveland is unnecessary and that alternatives are readily available.

► Former VA Secretary Dr. David Shulkin was instrumental in many of the pro-puppy reforms we’ve seen in recent years.

And while the VA absurdly drags its feet on ending this outdated program, the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control are moving away from dog experiments.

Help veterans, don't hurt dogs

We know all too well that veterans desperately need the resources that are currently wasted on unnecessary and cruel dog testing. The brave service members who have selflessly served this nation deserve better. That’s why our movement to end these experiments has the support of many national veterans’ groups that want to end this waste and abuse.

I knew too much about war, he knew blessedly little: Afghanistan veteran on the dog that is his best friend

Most importantly, our dogs — who are cherished pets, faithful partners to patriots serving abroad, and sources of comfort and healing to those who have returned home — deserve much better. Putting an end to the VA’s brutal dog experiments would be a win for veterans, taxpayer, and the dogs that are troops’ best friend. We intend to do exactly that, once and for all.

Agriculture Department's relocation of ERS and NIFA: A solution in search of a problem,https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/453332-agriculture-departments-relocation-of-ers-and-nifa-a-solution-in,"Earlier this year, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the relocation of the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) federal agencies from Washington, DC to the recently chosen Kansas City, Mo. Moving ERS and NIFA is a hasty solution in search of a nonexistent problem that wastes taxpayer money and will harm U.S. agriculture.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueThis is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington American farmers can't afford this administration's climate apathy Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE said the rationale for the move is to save taxpayer money and move the agencies closer to stakeholders. Upon closer examination, these reasons do not hold water. First, farmers and ranchers may be informed by ERS reports, but they are not direct recipients or users of most of the ERS products. ERS and NIFA are not regulatory or farm program agencies. These agencies do not implement farm programs like the Farm Services Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Nor do they inspect meat and poultry plants like the Food Safety and Inspection Service. ERS and NIFA research policy to advance agriculture-related sciences. The best place for these agencies is close to the center of policymaking, Washington, DC.

Additionally, the USDA decided to move the agencies out of the capital region before they even did a cost-benefit analysis, so it is unclear how they determined it would save taxpayer money. When the department finally did a cost-benefit analysis, the Government Accountability Office determined it was misleading and incomplete. USDA’s own estimate found average savings of just .13% of the total funding provided for ERS and NIFA in FY19—not even a full percentage point. An independent group of economists, The Agricultural and Applied Economics Association (AAEA), that includes two former ERS administrators, found that the move would actually cost taxpayers between $37 to 128 million, instead of saving money, due to a loss of talent.

Furthermore, the USDA already owns empty spaces in the capital region that could accommodate ERS and NIFA rent-free, while avoiding relocation, buy out, and early retirement costs—but this option wasn’t included in the official USDA cost-benefit analysis.

Not only does moving ERS and NIFA to Kansas City not make financial sense, it will set the agencies back for years due to loss of experienced, highly-specialized employees—yet another cost not accounted for in the department’s insufficient cost-benefit analysis. Employees are already quitting in anticipation of the move. Internal sources say the retirement rate has doubled since the move was announced, and on one day at the end of April, six people quit at ERS. According to a new union survey, nearly 70 percent of the ERS employees ordered to move to Kansas City will instead quit their jobs. The level of experience these agencies will lose cannot be replaced quickly or found just anywhere.

As chairman of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, I dedicated an entire hearing to this proposed relocation. We heard from four former USDA officials with a total of 70 years of experience in the ERS and NIFA over several administrations, a senior advisor to Secretary Perdue, and later in a separate hearing, Secretary Perdue himself. None of the former ERS and NIFA officials who testified agreed with the move. Nearly 110 agriculture science and food related organizations, at least 37 deans of university agriculture departments, several former government officials, and more than 1150 individual scientists from 47 states publicly oppose the move.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science and more than a dozen land-grant universities—most of them in the heartland to which the Trump administration wanted the agencies to be closer—have sent a letter to Senate appropriators urging them to stop the move because it “sends a clear message that agricultural research is not as important as research funded by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and numerous other major research agencies.”

Secretary Perdue himself remarked, “I’m just amazed that all those people you mentioned could be wrong.” I too wonder how all these experienced professionals could be wrong and why only the Trump administration seems to think this is a good idea. Employees at both agencies believe the move is punishment for research that did not align with the Trump administration’s agenda.

If the USDA succeeds in moving ERS and NIFA to Kansas City, there is no question it will disrupt normal operations that may never return to their previous efficiency and power. Our nation’s agriculture industry cannot afford delays to the vital economic data that ERS provides and the technological innovations developed through NIFA support. It’s ironic the proposal to relocate research and data-driven agencies seems to have no hard data supporting it. We should not harm our farmers and researchers by weakening the well-established infrastructure for research that has kept American agriculture No. 1 in the world.

What the USDA Label Really Says,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com,"['Jaclyn London', 'Ms', 'Rd', 'Cdn', 'Good Housekeeping Institute', 'Director', 'Nutrition Lab', 'A Registered Dietitian With A Bachelor Of Arts Degree Northwestern University', 'A Master Of Science Degree In Clinical Nutrition New York University', 'Jaclyn']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a28224713/what-does-organic-mean/,"You see the word ""organic"" thrown around everywhere these days — whether it's on food, clothing, beauty products, and more. But what does it actually mean to call something organic? The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Organic Standards Board defines the term as this:

""Organic"" is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole.

Okay ... So what does that definition actually mean for you? Here's what you really need to know about buying and eating organic food.

What exactly does organic mean?

To label a food as organic, it must meet the guidelines set by the USDA. These include:

Not using prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) for three years prior to harvest

Not using genetically modified organisms (GMOs)

Raising animals in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like grazing on pasture), feeding them 100% organic food, and not administering antibiotics or hormones

Omitting artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors from multi-ingredient, processed foods with some exceptions, like baking soda in baked goods

Organic agricultural production still uses pesticides and herbicides that USDA's organic certification standards have okayed. Just because something is labeled ""organic"" does not mean that no pesticides or herbicides were used. It simply means that the ones applied met the USDA's production standards for the term.

The definition of organic also limits the use of ""genetically modified organisms."" GMO crops have been genetically altered to withstand the application of herbicides and pesticides — chemicals that protect harvests from viruses and bugs. The introduction of GMOs into the food supply sparked a debate over their health and environmental implications. Anything bearing the USDA Organic Seal is automatically non-GMO.

What does organic food mean?

USDA

Contrary to popular belief, organic food relates back to agricultural production, not a specific nutrition- or health-related guideline. For a product to carry the USDA organic label, a third party must verify at least 95% of the ingredients as organic. The phrase ""made with organic ingredients"" means at least 70% of the ingredients used counted as organic.

Foods can still be organic even if they're not labeled as such. Since the standard requires third-party verification, there's a cost associated with the certification process. Food companies must consistently provide back-up documentation in order to use the ""USDA Organic"" seal. That makes it less desirable to smaller or newer brands that use organic production practices, but don't want to incur the costs of verification.



Is organic food really better?

Despite controversial headlines about this labeling claim, the agricultural practice used to produce food does not determine how nutritious it is for you, nor does it directly impact your state of health. Case in point: Organic cane sugar is still sugar. The nutrients you'll find within the food are what, over time, predominantly affect your health — not the growing methods used to make it. Also, organic products will cost more than their non-organic counterparts, which is a critical consideration for most of us on a budget.

There's also the question of whether or not genetically modifying crops are harmful to health. But to date, there's no substantial data to imply that GMO crops available on the consumer market pose a direct risk.

Does organic mean healthy?

Short answer? No. Growing methods do not universally make foods better or worse for you nutritionally. This is especially true when you consider eating a balanced diet overall. For example, USDA Organic beef is grass-fed, which implies that you'll find slightly more omega-3 fatty acids in it compared to conventionally raised cattle. But if you're also regularly consuming seafood, then you're already getting the omega-3's you need.

When you see alarmist headline about a specific pesticide used in conventional agriculture, it's almost always talking about exposure through proximity (i.e., field work), not ingesting the foods we eat. Some population studies show a correlation between buying organic food and better health, but it's important to consider the other factors that buying organic implies, including lifestyle and socioeconomic status. Since there's no specific, isolated link between the two, we simply cannot use the term ""organic"" to imply ""healthy"" — despite the fact that it's often marketed as such.

As for GMOs and your health? The most recent and comprehensive National Academy of Sciences report states that although genetically modified crops may vary in nutritional composition, the variation is no more than what would occur naturally among non-GMO crops. The report also analyzed data from large-scale studies since GMOs entered the food supply in the '90s, but did not find any associations with chronic disease incidence and dietary patterns.

The biggest issue with GMOs from a nutritional standpoint is the products in which they’re usually found: highly processed foods and beverages. The most predominant GMO crops — corn and soybeans — can go in packaged foods loaded with added sugar (e.g., sugary beverages made with corn syrup) and saturated fat.



Is anything really organic?

In food, yes. That's because the USDA requires companies to follow certain agricultural practices before getting verified. But in other types of products, that's not necessarily the case.

The Bottom Line: While we still don't know everything about GMOs and organic growing practices, there is one thing about this debate I can say with confidence: It's more important to know exactly what foods are wholesome, nutritious, and health-promoting overall rather than focusing on a specific label claim."

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

The rule the EPA is preparing to weaken would no longer allow community voices across the country to challenge decisions on how much pollution is legally allowed to be released at nearby power plants, according to the report.

Three people familiar with the draft plan, which has not yet been released, told the Times that industry stakeholders would still be allowed to appeal the EPA’s decisions to the Environmental Appeals Board.

The EPA did not confirm or deny the existence of the forthcoming rulemaking.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement.

News of the rule change, first announced by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on Friday, came the same week President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE held his environmental leadership speech at the White House.

“What E.P.A. is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,” Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the Environmental Appeals Board, told the Times.

Critics of the rule change say the appeals option offered communities a forum to push back on the EPA’s decisions without piling on legal fees and mounting lengthy legal cases.

Supporters of the change say it would eliminate red tape and speed up a process that ends up being decided by the courts anyway.

The rule proposal could be made public as soon as this week, according to the Times."

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose says President Donald Trump's recent tweets targeting Democratic congresswomen were racist and false.

“The president says things that I would never condone, that I believe are false,"" LaRose, a Republican elected in 2018, told The Enquirer's editorial board Tuesday. ""The most recent tweet is racist – whether it was intended that way or not, I’m not in the man’s mind and heart. I don’t know, but that’s how it sounds to me.”

Trump tweeted early Sunday that progressive members of Congress should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

Although Trump did not mention any lawmakers by name, he appears to be referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Three lawmakers were born in America and Omar, a native of Somalia, became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

In denouncing the tweets, LaRose went further than some fellow Republicans, who stopped short of calling the comments racist.

Sen. Rob Portman labeled them ""divisive, unnecessary and wrong."" Rep. Steve Chabot called diversity a strength of the nation, adding ""we can disagree without being disagreeable.”

Trump, on Tuesday, responded to detractors, tweeting ""I don't have a Racist bone in my body!""

Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019

LaRose's history with the president is mixed. He initially supported then-Gov. John Kasich's GOP bid for president in 2016. At one point, LaRose said he couldn't vote for Trump because of an Access Hollywood video that captured the then-nominee's lewd comments. Later, LaRose helped with the logistics for Trump's inauguration.

LaRose announced last month that he wouldn't endorse a candidate for president in 2020. It's part of an initiative with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, to encourage civility in politics – and a deeper trust of its election officials.

“Making self-government work again may be my generation’s man on the moon,"" LaRose told The Enquirer.

LaRose, who worked with Democrats to reform Ohio's map-drawing process, said civility goes beyond niceness.

""If people are retreating to their corners, finding cable news cameras and saying bombastic things about each other, how are those people going to come together to actually solve problems?"" LaRose asked. When there’s such incivility, there’s no room for compromise.

Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739860400/broken-promises-teachers-sue-u-s-over-student-loans-that-werent-forgiven,"Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

Resignation puts state Department of Human Services under the microscope. Again.,https://www.minnpost.com,"['Peter Callaghan', 'Andy Steiner', 'Walker Orenstein', 'About The Author']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2019/07/resignation-puts-state-department-of-human-services-under-the-microscope-again/,"When Tony Lourey told Gov. Tim Walz he wanted to leave his job as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, he said he wanted to do so immediately — to avoid drama and speculation.

Things didn’t exactly work out that way.

In a press release issued Monday morning, Walz’s office announced that Pam Wheelock would be appointed acting commissioner of the state’s largest agency. Wheelock has broad experience in government and nonprofits, including stints as Gov. Jesse Ventura’s finance commissioner and former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman’s deputy mayor. But beneath that annnounced in the release was the real news: that Lourey would resign and leave the job. At the end of the day.

Six months as DHS commissioner is not a long tenure, even in a volatile job like state government Cabinet secretary. And Lourey’s quick departure, especially after giving up a state Senate seat lost to Republicans in a February special election, created plenty of drama. Coming a weekend after the resignation of two long-serving and well-regarded senior department executives, the move also spawned widespread speculation.

Was he fired? Did the governor ask for the resignation letter? How much notice was Walz given?

At a news conference Monday, Walz said Lourey was not fired; that he didn’t ask for the resignation; and that he found out about the decision the day before. Even if those answers were designed to tamp down speculation, the timing and verbage the DFL governor used Monday — and that Lourey used in his resignation letter — triggered a day of reading between the lines.

While that isn’t unusual for political appointees, the difference was that Lourey also didn’t have a good working relationship with the senior bureaucrats who are often relied upon to run the place.

Walz said Monday that the two officials who recently resigned, Deputy Commissioners Chuck Johnson and Claire Wilson, spoke late last week with his chief of staff, Chris Schmitter, about their reasons for leaving the department. “When two longtime, dedicated public servants say they’re going to leave service, I want to know that, too,” Walz said.

While Walz described them as “very respectful,” the two said they disagreed with the direction the agency was going under Lourey.

“I expressed my desire to try to keep both of them,” said Walz.

Neither Johnson or Wilson are leaving immediately, and Walz wasn’t ruling out the possibility that they would rescind those resignations. “The resignation letter of the commissioner is very self-aware that maybe this is the wrong leadership style at this time to achieve the goals we are looking for,” Walz said. “I think Commissioner Lourey said, ‘I got you through this, I helped you get this budget, I got the provider tax sunset removed, now it’s time for someone else’s skill set.’”

That letter to Walz, while thanking him for the opportunity and citing “the real change I pushed for in an agency that needs to grow in how it connects with and partners with the people we serve,” noted in its conclusion: “I believe a new leader is necessary to best execute your vision for human services and continue the critical work of improving the health of Minnesotan across the state.”

Lourey said through an agency spokesperson that he was not doing interviews or taking questions about his departure.

Walz rejected suggestions that the department is in chaos and used Wheelock’s willingness to take on the job as evidence. “I don’t think that acting Commissioner Wheelock saw an agency in crisis,” he said. “I think she saw an agency at a transition point.”

Another issue might have contributed to the timing of the announcement. Last week, the Pioneer-Press reported that the Department of Human Services was still paying Inspector General Carolyn Ham four months after putting her on leave. While the suggestion was that she was the subject of an investigation into how the department responded to allegations of fraud and theft in the Child Care Assistance Program, Ham said no investigation had begun.

On Monday, Walz said an investigation had begun but wouldn’t say when. Later, House GOP Leader Kurt Daudt said he’d been told that morning that the investigation had begun “very recently.”

Walz said he was restricted in what he could say but said that no state employee took money.

“The situation that happened with the Child Care Assistance Program is totally unacceptable,” Walz said. “And to be totally clear, no one in state government stole any money. Private businesses stole from the state of Minnesota and we were negligent — or it appears to me that we were negligent — in stopping that in a timely manner.”

The investigation, he said, is to understand why that happened.

But Walz also said there was no linkage between the CCAP issue and Lourey’s resignation. “I think there’s going to be a desire to find more drama than is there,” he said. “Those of you who know me know I don’t do drama. I think the situation is we have a complex agency, the skillset Commissioner Lourey possessed was incredibly helpful and was the catalyst to helping us get a budget done.”

Now, however, as policies and budgets are implemented, and as the CCAP problems are addressed, “I will take Commissioner Lourey at this word that he felt he was not the right person at this time to do that.”

While neither Johnson nor Wilson made public statements about concerns with the agency, another person who recently left the agency did. Dr. Jeff Schiff was the longtime medical director to the state Medicaid program before his job was eliminated last month. The Pioneer Press reported that he issued a statement last week after Johnson’s and Wilson’s resignations: “This event, following the reorganization that led to my departure, points to serious systemic issues with the leadership culture of the agency,” he said. “I call upon Governor Walz and Lieutenant Governor Flanagan to live up to their pledge of ‘One Minnesota,’ investigate, and act so that we can go back to being the healthiest state in the nation for all Minnesotans.”

Republican legislators had already scheduled a noon press conference to talk about the Johnson and Wilson resignations, arguing that it signaled disarray in the agency. Monday’s announcement changed the narrative a bit, but not the political message.

“Since Gov. Walz has taken office, the department has been embroiled in chaos,” said Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria. She compared it to a dumpster fire. Daudt repeatedly termed the resignation of Lourey and whatever led up to it as a “scandal.” Daudt, R-Crown, said he has been around state government long enough to know commissioners don’t get fired, they get asked to resign.

The rapid action suggests that this has been “boiling up for a few days,” he said, and that the state is owed a more specific explanation of why Lourey resigned. “I can assure you that Commissioner Lourey didn’t give up a Senate seat to serve as commissioner for six months,” Daudt said.

And while he was willing to allow Walz some leeway since the CCAP fraud investigation covered his predecessor’s term in office, that will end soon. “There comes a time when fraud is overlooked enough that Gov. Walz will own that fraud,” Daudt said. “If he does nothing to fix the fraud, he becomes part of the fraud.”

Unlike Daudt and Franson, who are minority members of the House, Sen. Michelle Benson is a member of the Senate’s majority caucus, and as such controls a committee with oversight of the Department of Human Services. The Ham Lake Republican said she had a working relationship with Lourey, both when he served in the state Senate and then as commissioner. She termed it a “functional working relationship” and said he called her last week to tell her of the Johnson and Wilson resignations.

But she said her hopes that Lourey would be a “transformative leader” were not realized. “It just might be the case that DHS is too big of an entrenched bureaucracy, even for someone with Tony Lourey’s experience, to transform,” Benson said.

She renewed her call to break the agency up into parts and said Walz should call on experts from the private sector as he did to resolve delays and cost overruns in the MNLARS state licensing system. “It is time the governor grab the leadership and move this to a better place,” Benson said. “That’s all I want. In 18 months for the place to be noticeably and fundamentally better.”

Benson’s counterpart in the House, Health and Human Services Finance chair Tina Liebling, called the Lourey resignation disappointing and described him as “a great guy.”

But the job is a difficult one, she said, “maybe even harder than governor,” and that Lourey may not have known how tough it was until he was in the midst of it.

The DFLer said she too was surprised that the investigation into the office of inspector general and the CCAP issue either hadn’t begun or has just been begun. And she called the loss of Johnson and Wilson “a tremendous loss for the administration.” Johnson, she said, was respected by both parties in the Legislature. “He has always engendered a lot of comfort,” she said. “He knows the agency and he handles himself well.

“He’s the one you want in the room when there’s some tough issue,” she said.

But she rejected GOP suggestions that the situation at DHS represents disarray or chaos. “I’m as surprised as anyone. It is a short period of time,” she said. But compared to the comings and going of members of the Trump administration, it doesn’t suggest a lot of turnover. “It isn’t a disaster. I think it’s just an opportunity to rethink what the agency needs.”"
Democrats ask Labor Department to investigate Amazon warehouses,https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/453314-democrats-ask-labor-department-to-investigate-amazon-warehouses,"A dozen Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Labor Tuesday asking the agency to investigate Amazon for potential workplace abuse as employees at a Minnesota center protested what they called unfair and unsafe conditions.

The letter, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersWarren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' Sanders slams decision not to charge officer who killed Eric Garner Cardi B says voters let Bernie Sanders down MORE (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar Ilhan OmarScaramucci calls Trump tweets 'racist and unacceptable' House Democrat pushes for censuring Trump in closed-door meeting Black Caucus leader calls Trump's attacks on minority lawmakers 'despicable' MORE (D-Minn.), calls on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to look into conditions at all Amazon warehouses.

Amazon, in a blog post, denied the allegations of unsafe conditions and renewed an open invitation for lawmakers to tour facilities.

The letter cites reports of unsafe conditions, as well as personal accounts the lawmakers said employees have shared with them.

""Hundreds of stories shared with our offices paint a picture of desperation and a corporate employer with little regard for the health of its employees,"" the letter reads.

One worker described the warehouse as a ""21st century sweatshop,"" and other workers said there is no air conditioning in facilities, according to lawmakers.

Some Amazon employees said they feared retaliation for bathroom breaks and would limit the amount of liquids they consumed, and one said they took medication to not have to use the restroom, according to the letter.

“Hundreds of workers have shared their stories with us about unconscionable working conditions at Amazon,” Sanders said in a release. ""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job. They must be treated with dignity and respect.”

""It is past time for OSHA to launch a comprehensive investigation into the inhumane condition in Amazon warehouses—and hold this corporate malfeasance accountable to the fullest extent of the law,"" Omar said.

Amazon defended itself against the allegations outlined in the letter, saying the claims are not an accurate portrayal of its buildings.

The company said more than 125,000 people, including 441 policymakers and their staff, took public tours this year, including Omar. Amazon said in the months following Omar’s tour of a Minnesota facility, the congresswoman did not raise concerns over conditions.

The company also said that Sanders has “committed to visiting, but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings.”

The company also said it spent more than $55 million on safety improvement projects within the last year and regularly seeks employee feedback about safety.

The lawmakers' letter comes as Amazon holds its annual ""Prime Day"" sale, which lasted two days for the first time this year.

Workers at a fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minn., walked out Monday during the sale, saying Amazon did not meet their demands to convert more temporary positions to full-time jobs and to ease productivity quotas, multiple outlets reported.

Amazon disputes the employees' allegations about conditions, and claims 90 percent of associates at the Shakopee center are full-time employees and more than 30 have been offered full-time positions recently.

""The fact is that Amazon provides a safe, quality work environment in which associates are the heart and soul of the customer experience, and today’s event shows that our associates know that to be true,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a previous statement to The Hill. ""We encourage anyone to come take a tour anytime.”

USDA Crop Progress Report Grades Corn Condition Slightly Better,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-crop-progress-report-grades-corn-condition-slightly-better,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The U.S. corn and soybean crops made slight improvements vs. a week ago, but remain behind five-year averages for silking and emergence, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday.

Corn

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared with 57% a week ago.

USDA pegged just 17% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 42% five-year average.

As of Sunday, Illinois had just 19% of its corn crop in the silk growth stage, Indiana 10% and Iowa 8%.

Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, a 1% rise from last week.

Also, 95% of the soybean crop is emerged vs. a 99% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the soybean blooming activity at 22%, well below a five-year average of 49%.

Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 57% complete vs. a 71% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, below last week’s 78% rating."
Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

DOD takes early steps in implementing software acquisition recommendations,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/swap-study-implementation-cummings-ranks-gonzalez/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

Three senior leaders at the Department of Defense have been chosen to lead work around the four “lines of effort” that the Defense Innovation Board identified in the recent Software Acquisition and Practices (SWAP) study.

Stacy Cummings, principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for acquisition enablers; Peter Ranks, deputy chief information officer for information enterprise; and Jose Gonzalez, executive director of human capital initiatives, will be tasked with implementing approved recommendations in these four areas, DIB executive director Joshua Marcuse said during the board’s recent public meeting.

The SWAP study represents the results of the board’s efforts to understand how the military acquires software and how it could do better. The four lines of effort for the DOD are:

Refactor statutes, regulations, and processes for software.

Create and maintain cross-program/cross-service digital infrastructure.

Create new paths for digital talent (especially internal talent).

Change the practice of how software is procured and developed.

The study makes recommendations in each of these areas, amounting to 10 primary recommendations and 16 additional items that represent the “next set of things to do,” according to board member Richard Murray.

Per Marcuse, Cummings with be in charge of the first and fourth on the list, Ranks will be heading up the second line of effort and Gonzalez will be working to create paths for digital talent. The three leaders are already working on implementation of the DIB’s recommendations in these areas.

Marcuse also said that Ellen Lord, undersecretary of Defense for acquisition and sustainment, plans to deliver an implementation plan for the SWAP study to Congress in the “coming weeks.”

The SWAP study was mandated by the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. The document was officially delivered to Congress in May."
E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"

Former DHS chief warns immigrants not to open doors for ICE without a warrant,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeh-johnson-on-face-the-nation-former-dhs-chief-warns-immigrants-not-to-open-doors-for-ice-without-a-warrant/,"Jeh Johnson, who led the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during President Obama's second term, advised undocumented immigrants they are not required to open the doors of their homes to immigration authorities unless agents produce a warrant signed by a judge.

""If someone from ICE ERO comes to someone's home — unless they have a warrant — that person is not required to admit them,"" Johnson said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, referring to the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which is responsible for apprehending people the government seeks to deport.

ICE was slated to begin a new wave of roundups on Sunday targeting about 2,000 undocumented families with open deportation orders living in major U.S. cities. The operations were first publicly announced last month by President Trump, who postponed them for a few weeks.

To prepare for the raids — which have left many undocumented immigrants living in constant fear — advocacy groups and Democrats have mobilized to mount a high-profile campaign designed to inform people who could be targeted about their rights and other information, one of them being Johnson's advice.

Pro-immigrant organizations want to make sure people are not opening their doors to ICE agents who do not have a search and seizure warrant signed by a judge. When conducting roundups, ICE agents often produce an administration warrant — but attorneys say that by itself does not give them the right to enter private property to apprehend someone.

Johnson also noted that just because someone is apprehended, that does not mean the person is automatically deported without access to any legal recourse.

""They have a right to a lawyer and they should not be deported from this country unless there has been a final order of deportation by an immigration judge after the individuals had an opportunity to go through the appellate process and make whatever claims for asylum they have,"" he said.

In fact, he suggested that some of deportations of those who are apprehended by ICE during the looming sweeps will be delayed or stopped as attorneys file motions to reopen their cases in immigration court. He noted that judges often grant new hearings for those who were ordered deported without being present in the courtroom. Attorneys have said that many people miss court because of bureaucratic errors, like their notices to appear being sent late or to the wrong address.

""Very often if someone's ordered deported in absentia without being present in court they have a right to a rehearing,"" Johnson said. ""And so it's important for people particularly today and over the next week to know exactly what their rights are.""

Like Obama, when Johnson was at the helm of DHS, he came under fire from progressive and pro-immigrant activists for the millions of deportations during their administration, as well as for his handling of the 2014 surge of unaccompanied migrant children from Central America coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. He and other Obama-era officials have noted that many of those deported during those years had criminal convictions and were migrants who had recently crossed into the U.S. illegally."
