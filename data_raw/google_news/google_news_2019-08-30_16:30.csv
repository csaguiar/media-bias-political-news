"Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's gatekeeper, was known for her loyalty -- until she was pushed out",https://www.cnn.com,"['Betsy Klein', 'Kaitlan Collins']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/30/politics/who-is-madeleine-westerhout/index.html,"(CNN) One of the people who has sat the closest to President Donald Trump throughout his presidency isn't a household name, but her abrupt departure Thursday sent shockwaves through the West Wing.

So it was surprising to her colleagues when she wasn't at work this week in her usual seat outside the President's office. Others who noticed her absence said she was on a scheduled summer vacation. But when news broke late Thursday night that she had been pushed out after revealing what one person described as intimate information during an off-the-record dinner with reporters, three senior officials said they were caught off-guard. CNN was not among the news organizations represented at the dinner.

Westerhout's departure comes as unwelcome news to Trump's allies outside the West Wing. She was a constant who outlasted three chiefs of staff, and was a reliable person to call if someone needed to meet with the President.

She also carried immense weight in the West Wing. If reporters wanted to request an interview with the President, they often went around former press secretary Sarah Sanders and called Westerhout.

But her closeness also carried with it some concerns. Westerhout was one of few aides who had access to the President's highly sensitive schedule, prompting some internal paranoia when details of meetings with few aides leaked to reporters.

She will perhaps be remembered for her loyalty -- one of the few remaining original staffers to survive the chaos of the early days of the administration and known as a true believer in Trump's policies. But in the end, it was an act of disloyalty that undid her.

Who was Trump's trusted aide?

Madeleine Westerhout, 28, served as special assistant to the President and director of Oval Office Operations when she stepped down. She began on Day One of the administration and by 2019, she was one of the highest-paid White House staffers with a salary of $145,000.

A California native, Westerhout moved to the East Coast to attend the College of Charleston, where she was a political science major. She took the fall semester of her senior year off to intern for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, according to College of Charleston's College Today . She worked on Capitol Hill after graduation, and then served as the assistant to former Republican National Committee chief of staff Katie Walsh, who later became a senior adviser to the Trump transition team.

It was reported in two books that she was in tears when Trump won on Election Night. In the weeks that followed, she unintentionally became one of the most visible -- if silent -- members of the transition team thanks to her role escorting VIPs, potential administration officials, and even Leonardo DiCaprio through the Trump Tower lobby. She became publicly known as ""elevator girl"" or ""Trump Tower girl,"" quietly whisking the then-President-elect's guests up the golden elevators.

""The President-elect wanted to make sure all of his meetings were very transparent, so it became a little bit more public than I originally thought it was going to be,"" she told CNN in a brief interview in 2016.

She said she got calls from family and friends who saw her on television ""all the time,"" and there was some added pressure to be camera-ready.

""(I) definitely have to plan my outfits in advance, and we're staying at a hotel in New York so I have to pack well in advance,"" she told CNN.

When she arrived at the White House in January 2017, she became the ""new Rhona."" Rhona Graff occupied the role of Trump's assistant for most of his career as a businessman, and Trump's reliance on and confidence in her was evident in her appearances on many seasons of ""The Apprentice."" When Graff chose to stay with the Trump Organization in New York, Westerhout assumed that role, fielding calls and managing the day-to-day Oval Office movements of a freewheeling President.

Westerhout was also one of six White House officials found to have violated the Hatch Act in 2018.

It's unclear what's next for Westerhout, and her abrupt exit is a disappointment and shock for those who worked with her."

WASHINGTON – A former Canadian prime minister said she's ""rooting"" for Hurricane Dorian to directly hit President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club on Florida's coast.

Kim Campbell, Canada's first and only female prime minister, wrote on Twitter Wednesday: ""I’m rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!""

Campbell on Thursday continued to tweet about the storm and how it is appears to be heading toward Mar-a-Lago.

""Well, we will see if Mrs. Post’s design can stand up to the assault!"" she wrote in a tweet, referencing the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built Mar-a-Lago. ""I know Palm Beach well and am sorry if it gets a big hit.

'Absolute monster': Hurricane Dorian on track to rock Florida as Category 4 storm

Hurricane Dorian is currently a Category 2 storm and is hurtling towards Florida's east coast. It is expected to make landfall Monday where it will likely be a Category 4, according to the National Hurricane Center. Palm Beach, where Mar-a-Lago is located, is on the eastern part of the state expected to be hit by the storm.

The president frequently visits Mar-a-Lago and has called it the ""Southern White House.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties in the state and urged residents to gather enough food, water and other supplies for at least a week.

Trump canceled his upcoming trip to Poland this weekend to monitor the hurricane. The president was set to commemorate the start of World War II and meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Vice President Mike Pence will now travel in Trump's place.

What to know: When will Hurricane Dorian hit Florida?

On Thursday, Trump called the storm ""an absolute monster"" in a video he tweeted, comparing it to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated Florida in 1992.

""All indications are it’s going to hit very hard and it’s going to be very big,"" Trump said in the video.

Campbell received backlash for her comments.

One Twitter user replied to her Wednesday tweet, saying: ""What the heck is wrong with you. There are real people who live and work there.""

She replied: ""As there are in Puerto Rico- sorry you don’t get snark- but Trump’s indifference to suffering is intolerable!""

""[Would] also help if he tackled climate change which is making hurricanes more destructive! Instead, he will remove limits on methane! Get a grip!"" she concluded.

Impeachment fever rises as Dems face summer-recess pressure to go after Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-trump-impeachment,"The summer recess has turned up the heat on congressional Democrats to get on board the Trump impeachment push.

At town hall meetings across the country this August, rank-and-file Democrats returning to their home districts have faced intense pressure from left-wing activists demanding they support efforts to impeach President Trump when they return to Washington, D.C.

DEM COURT FILING SUGGESTS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PROBE BEGAN BEFORE MUELLER EVEN SUBMITTED REPORT

The impact this will have on the impeachment drive – which some lawmakers insist is already underway to an extent, despite little public support at present from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – remains to be seen.

But The Hill reports 30 Democrats have backed starting the process since the recess began. In total, at least 135 House members now support an impeachment inquiry, including 17 members of the House Judiciary Committee.

In California, Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., was immediately grilled about impeachment at a town hall this month. When she said she broadly favors impeachment, she was met by “rousing applause” according to Politico.

“People said, ‘Well, this might be risky, you might not get reelected,’” Porter said. “I said, ‘I am here to do what’s right.’”

In New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., faced a more hostile reception when she said she opposes impeachment at this time and reportedly was interrupted multiple times as she made her point. The crowd accused her of playing politics, according to Politico, and threatened her with a primary challenge.

“Don’t be last to speak up. You’ll be challenged,"" one woman told her.

While some lawmakers in safe blue seats can bang the drum for impeaching the president – whether it be over Trump’s finances or his alleged instances of obstructing justice outlined in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report – the move carries significant political risk elsewhere, particularly in more moderate states.

In Pennsylvania, Rep. Susan Wild was also asked about her reluctance to back impeachment in the first question at a recent town hall.

""Why have you not come out for impeachment?” a moderator asked, reading from an audience-submitted question, according to The Morning Call. She told the audience that she was “not there yet.”

PELOSI HECKLED BY PROTESTERS DEMANDING TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AT SAN FRANCISCO AWARD DINNER

“You don’t want to try a case where the facts are not all lined up and you’re ready with all of your evidence that you’re going to introduce,” she said. “I don’t believe we are there at this point in time, and that’s why I have not come out to say that I think that we should be moving forward with impeachment.”

Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., who has opposed impeachment, was shouted down by a hostile crowd of hundreds of activists and constituents when he said he opposed impeachment, according to Politico.

“You are going to give Donald Trump another four years by doing that. You are helping him. You are helping him get another four years,” Lynch told the furious crowd.

Roll Call reports that other members of Congress, including Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J., and Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, have also been peppered with questions at town halls.

It comes as more and more Democrats are signing on to the impeachment effort, even after the Mueller report drew a blank on evidence that Trump’s campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia during the 2016 election — the initial declared basis for activists seeking to oust the president.

But since then, activists and elected Democrats have moved onto other reasons for demanding the president be removed — including questions to do with his finances, alleged obstruction of justice or other alleged abuses of power.

The state of play is that they are getting there, but still have more members to flip. More than half of House Democrats currently support the process, though it's not clear how many would actually vote to impeach Trump.

But Democrats need to thread the needle between satisfying their activist base and not pushing away moderates more interested in action on health care, immigration and infrastructure rather than an impeachment bid almost certainly doomed in the Senate.

That has been reflected by the stance of Pelosi, D-Calif. Despite pressure from the base, as well as impeachment-related inquiries from allies on the House Judiciary Committee, Pelosi has not come out in favor of impeachment and has tried to steer Democrats towards more kitchen-table issues. Last week she was heckled by protesters unhappy at her stance at a dinner in San Francisco.

“Nancy Pelosi do your job,” the crowd chanted.

In that she faces pushback from left-wing members of Congress, particularly the four freshman congresswomen known as the “Squad.” Those four members have vigorously favored impeachment, with Rep. Rashida Tlaib promising to impeach Trump on numerous occasions.

They also face pressure from Democratic presidential candidates. Contenders such as Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., have all called for impeachment proceedings, while former Vice President Joe Biden said in the spring that proceedings “may be unavoidable if this administration continues on its path.”

Roll Call flagged remarks by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who told a local New York outlet recently that the pro-impeachment crowd was now moving to increase pressure on wavering members, after having spoken to Pelosi on the issue.

“We talked about the debate among the caucus on impeachment. And this is the thing: when people want to push to impeach, she needs the votes. She needs the votes for it. First and foremost as the speaker, she's a vote counter,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So our job is to really pressure a lot of the members.”

Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."

Ukraine's New Parliament Approves Top Cabinet Officials,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-29/ukraines-new-parliament-approves-top-cabinet-officials,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to newly elected Ukrainian parliament deputies during parliament session in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019. Parliament in Ukraine has opened for its first session since an election last month. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) The Associated Press

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday urged lawmakers to help liberalize the economy and pursue integration into Europe as the newly-elected parliament swiftly approved his appointees for top government jobs.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian elected president in April, told parliament that the public expects lawmakers to help return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and settle the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Facing a hostile parliament after his landslide victory, Zelenskiy called a snap parliamentary election in July that gave his Servant of the People party the parliament majority. The party takes its name from the popular television sitcom in which Zelenskiy played a high school teacher propelled into the presidency.

Like Zelenskiy, a newcomer in politics, none of the Servant of the People lawmakers have previous experience in parliament. Many Ukrainians, who have grown tired of the old elites they see as corrupt and inefficient, see it as an advantage.

The Verkhovna Rada on Thursday quickly named Oleksiy Honcharuk, 35, as the nation's new prime minister. In his speech in parliament, Honcharuk pledged to focus on encouraging economic growth, raising living standards and combating corruption.

""No one will be allowed to steal in the new government,"" he said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy a star. Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think tank. ""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

Sidenko noted that Honcharuk will face a tough task of introducing unpopular measures that Ukraine's Western investors expect the government to take to shore up the economy.

""The new prime minister will have to do dirty and unpopular work, reducing state subsidies and social assistance as required by the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders,"" Sidenko said.

The lawmakers also quickly approved other Zelenskiy's appointees for top jobs.

Ivan Bakanov, who directed Zelenskiy's campaign, was named the chief of Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU.

Dmytro Razumkov, who served as Zelenskiy's campaign adviser and later became the leader of his party, was elected parliamentary speaker.

The Rada also approved the new foreign minister, Vadim Pristaiko, who previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and later its envoy to NATO.

Speaking to lawmakers, Pristaiko pledged to push for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.

""We need peace and stability,"" he said.

Andriy Zahorodniuk, who was named defense minister, pledged to streamline the military and free it of graft.

""Everyone knows that they steal in the army,"" he said. ""People have grown tired of those problems.""

Two of the members of former President Petro Poroshenko's Cabinet kep their jobs — Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Finance Minister Oksana Markarova.

Markarova is a technocrat, while Avakov helped Zelenskiy win by speaking out about Poroshenko's alleged attempts to buy voters' support before the election.

Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta Center think tank said Zelenskiy wants the new Cabinet to speed up liberal economic reforms, but is aware of the challenges.

""President Zelenskiy wants the new parliament and the new Cabinet to serve as instruments to achieve quick reforms,"" Fesenko said. ""The new Cabinet will inevitably face a dilemma of how to conduct swift reforms without a further plunge in the already low living standards that could provoke a social explosion."""
"Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis: ""I had no choice but to leave"" Trump administration",https://www.salon.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/29/former-secretary-of-defense-james-mattis-i-had-no-choice-but-to-leave-trump-administration/,"James Mattis, the former defense secretary to President Donald Trump, says he had ""no choice but to leave"" the administration.

In a rare interview, Mattis, a former Marine Corps general who has sought to keep a low profile, explained why he left Trump's Cabinet after two years in his post. While he appeared reluctant to offer details about his unceremonious departure, he pointed to his resignation letter, which was included in his upcoming book, ""Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,"" to highlight his reasoning.

""I had no choice but to leave,"" Mattis told the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, breaking his eight-month retreat from the public eye. ""That's why the letter is in the book. I want people to understand why I couldn't stay. I've been informed by four decades of experience, and I just couldn't connect the dots anymore.""

Mattis reportedly demurred when asked about Trump, noting he does not believe it is appropriate for him to speak out publicly about any disagreements he may have had with the president. He explained that while he ""may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit,"" attacking the president could weaken the country ""when we're up against real threats. I mean, we could be at war on the Korean peninsula, every time they start launching something.""

""If you leave an administration, you owe some silence,"" the general said, referring to the French concept of ""devoir de réserve,"" or ""duty of silence."" He added, ""When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country.""

""They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours,"" he continued. ""I know the malevolence some people feel for this country, and we have to give the people who are protecting us some time to carry out their duties without me adding my criticism to the cacophony that is right now so poisonous.""

Mattis stepped down from the Trump administration in December 2018. His resignation letter pointed to stark differences with the Trump on a range of foreign policy issues — from the president's hasty decision to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan to his approach to North Korea. Mattis refused to endorse Trump's decision to pull out of Syria and Afghanistan and resigned after his pleas were rejected. He stepped down in January, two months before his departure date, after Trump had grown frustrated by the idea that he was being publicly rebuked by a member of his administration.

Advertisement:

""Because you have the right to have a secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" Mattis wrote in his resignation letter.

In an except from his forthcoming book, adapted into an essay for the Wall Street Journal, Mattis wrote, ""I did as well as I could for as long as I could. When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign.""

Although the general's criticisms are deeply veiled, he told the Atlantic he may one day speak freely about his experience working in the Trump administration.

""There is a period in which I owe my silence,"" he said. ""It's not eternal. It's not going to be forever."""
"Who is Oleksiy Honcharuk, Ukraine's new prime minister?",https://www.aljazeera.com,[],,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/oleksiy-honcharuk-ukraine-prime-minister-190829160052863.html,"Only 35 years old and with just three months of government experience, Oleksiy Honcharuk has become Ukraine's youngest-ever prime minister amid a stalling economy and war in the east.

Ukraine's new president, 41-year-old Volodymyr Zelensky, himself a political novice and a popular comedian before winning April's election, nominated Honcharuk on Thursday after weeks of consultations.

Honcharuk's candidacy was quickly approved by MPs as Zelensky's new ""Servant of the People"" party holds a majority after parliamentary polls last month.

He replaces Volodymyr Groysman, 41, who offered his resignation after Zelensky's inauguration.

The young lawyer is little known to the public and has given few interviews. A source in the president's office told the AFP news agency he prefers to ""quietly do his job"".

The appointment is in line with Zelensky's pledge to bring in fresh faces and shake up Ukraine's stagnant politics.

Honcharuk, who studied law and public administration before cofounding a law firm at the age of 24, is considered a supporter of liberal economic reforms. Some have described him as a ""team player"" and ""workaholic"".

Before becoming deputy head of the president's office when Zelensky came to power, he managed for several years an EU-funded NGO that works to improve the business environment in Ukraine.

Zelensky's election win took place against a backdrop of war that has killed more than 13,000 people in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, with government forces fighting Russia-backed separatists. The conflict followed Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 which in turn came after Ukraine overthrew Moscow-backed leader Viktor Yanukovich earlier that year.

'Technical figure'

Analysts say it is unlikely Honcharuk will be able to steer government policy and will remain largely in the shadow of the presidency.

""Honcharuk cannot be an independent prime minister, even if he wanted to,"" analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the AFP.

A high-ranking source who has previously worked with Honcharuk described the experience as ""moderately positive"".

The source said Honcharuk had a ""well-structured"" vision and is adept ""at setting priorities that can achieve results"".

But in government the best he can hope to do is play a ""positive technical role"" with the support of the president's office, the source said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelensky a star.

Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelensky's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think-tank.

""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

'Eastern European tiger'

In rare interviews, Honcharuk has pleaded for continued cooperation with the IMF, calling it ""crucial"" for Ukraine.

The country is looking to work with the IMF for the next three to four years, he told Novoe Vremya magazine, with hopes this would help Ukraine become ""an Eastern European tiger"".

Honcharuk also supports revoking a ban on the sale of fertile agricultural land - a decision much awaited by Western investors and creditors, but to which the vast majority of Ukrainians are opposed.

Oleksandr Parashchiy, head of analytics at investment bank Concorde Capital, said the main challenge for the new government is ""not to disappoint people's expectations, which will be difficult"".

""The main thing that is expected is economic reforms and the fight against corruption,"" Parashchiy said.

Honcharuk himself seemed upbeat about the country's outlook.

""Soon positive changes will accelerate significantly,"" he wrote on his Facebook page after meeting World Bank President David Malpass in Ukraine last week.

""Everything will be fine,"" he captioned a picture. ""Stay tuned!"""

Kanbawza Bank has tapped Williams & Connolly, a U.S.-based law firm, to be the company's legal representatives in case U.S. sanctions arise from the U.N.'s fact finding mission. The report accuses Myanmar's military of having ties to a litany of businesses and that those dealings have led to extensive human rights abuses. The U.N. called for a criminal investigation into KBZ Bank's parent company, KBZ Group, for allegedly funding a border fence that has prevented Rohingya Muslims from returning to Myanmar after fleeing the country in 2017.

The firm sent a letter to the bank's CEO, Michael DeNoma, earlier this month and it describes the agreement between the two parties, including a $250,000 retainer.

""Williams & Connolly LLP will provide legal services to you in connection with potential US legal issues and sanctions matters which may arise out of an August 5, 2019 UN Human Rights Council Report on Myanmar,"" David Aufhauser, a partner in the firm, wrote. Aufhauser was previously a managing director and global general counsel at investment bank UBS.

The bank's new hire was discovered after CNBC reviewed foreign lobbying registration forms, with one of the documents describing other responsibilities that may involve having to reach out to members of President Donald Trump's administration, congressional lawmakers and the U.N. itself.

""Additional services will potentially include providing advice regarding legal consequences of the report, providing advice on lobbying and public relations issues related to the representation, lobbying U.S. government officials in the Executive Branch, Congress,and/or the United Nations, and discussing the matter with U.S. or international media organizations,"" the exhibit reads.

The U.N., Aufhauser and KBZ Bank did not return requests for comment.

The effort by KBZ Bank to retain a marquee legal team suggests there are internals fears of severe backlash after the U.N. report, especially from foreign governments such as the U.S. The bank itself has always been held in a high regard around the world.

The Milken Institute, a economic think tank based out of California, described KBZ Bank in a 2017 study as a firm that dominates the Myanmar market.

""Among the privately owned banks, the so-called 'Big Three' dominate the market,"" the study says. ""Combined, Kanbawza Bank (KBZ), Ayeyarwady Bank (AYA), and Co-operative Bank (CB) control about two-thirds of all loans, two-thirds of all deposits, and more than 50 percent of all bank branches in the country.""

Members of the U.N. are scheduled to meet in September for the 74th session of the General Assembly in New York."
US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."

The Commerce Department stated at the time that licenses would be granted to U.S. companies wanting to deal with Huawei, as long as there were no security risks involved. Now, Reuters is reporting that the department has received 130 license applications to sell goods and services to Huawei.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration hasn’t granted any of these applications, the newswire reported, citing three sources.

Editor's Pick Huawei Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro: All the rumors in one place (Updated August 26) Update, August 26, 2019 (5:55PM ET): A new leak from China reportedly shows off the Mate 30 Pro for the first time. Check out the article below for more information! Original article: The Huawei Mate 30 …

The news coincides with Google reportedly confirming that the upcoming Huawei Mate 30 series wouldn’t launch with Google apps and services. This suggests that Google may have been one of the many applicants denied by the administration, if it indeed applied to deal with Huawei.

The lack of license approvals will likely put pressure on the company’s other devices too, including its cheaper phones and Matebook line of laptops. Huawei is known to use Qualcomm Snapdragon silicon in some phones, while its Matebook laptops all run on Intel processors, and both companies are U.S. firms.

Donald Trump Jr. Campaigns for Dr. Greg Murphy,https://www.witn.com,[],,,,https://www.witn.com/content/news/Donald-Trump-Jr-Campaigns-for-Dr-Greg-Murphy-558631081.html,"Donald Trump Jr. was in New Bern Monday night to campaign for 3rd District Congressional candidate Republican Dr. Greg Murphy.

Trump Jr. said, ""We win this seat, we use it, we keep going forward and win North Carolina in 2020, we're gonna win the presidency.""

Trump Jr. was sounding confident as he spoke to the crowd of supporters gathered at the private campaign event for Murphy.

Murphy says, ""It's great to have the executive branch supporting those of us who are going to be in the legislative branch.""

The campaign stop is one of two Trump Jr. and conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle made in North Carolina Wednesday, both for congressional candidates. The first stop was in Charlotte.

Guilfoyle says, ""We want to make sure that we have winners that are going to support the president and stand shoulder to shoulder with the president.""

The visit to eastern Carolina comes less than two weeks before election day for the 3rd Congressional District seat.

Voters are choosing between Murphy, Democrat Allen Thomas and two third party candidates, to replace the late Congressman, Republican Walter Jones.

Murphy says, ""You know, It's a low turnout, that's what a special election is, but I think folks have really responded to our message.""

Trump Jr. is urging voters to head to the polls and get their friends to do the same, as early voting continues for another week. He says, ""Make sure you turn up. When you do, we win and winning is so much better than losing, right?""

Those who aren't registered to vote in this special election can still do so if you vote early. You will have to bring an ID and a bill with your name and address on in to register. Early voting will continue until September 6th when polls close at 7:00 p.m.

Election day is September 10th.

U.S. weekly jobless claims increase slightly,https://kfgo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/29/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-slightly/932105/,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.

Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.

But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.

According to economists at JPMorgan, this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.

Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.

For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%.

SGA Vice President Melissa Hevener started off the meeting with a general explanation of Senate meetings.

“SGA recognizes Senate as an open public forum. That means technically any student can come and attend senate because we are being held accountable by the student body through that mechanism,” she said.

Hevener explained that it is the student body’s responsibility to come to SGA members and voice their concerns, but it is additionally the representatives' duty to respond to their needs.

Next on the docket were “housekeeping” topics, including homecoming court nominations and the First-Year Connect mentor program. SGA Executive Cabinet Chief of Staff Hayden Kolodziejcyk explained the details of what was expected.

Hevener discussed plans for The Georgia Way, a new initiative designed to create an honor code for the student body that will help “to ensure that we are holding ourselves to certain community standards that may not be enforceable.”

As an organization, SGA wants every member of the community to feel valued, Hevener said. Concerning The Georgia Way, members are responsible for “pushing out this idea that as a student body, we stand behind these ideals of respect, honesty and integrity.”

The Georgia Way will accumulate to a week of programming in November after an initial planning meeting for members in mid-September. SGA will be designing the creed in a way that is inclusive of the student body as a whole. In an effort to represent the campus, Heavener encouraged members to use their voices to interact with as many student organizations on campus as possible so students feel that their voices matter.

President Rachel Byers opened the floor to an open discussion where members had an opportunity to express concerns they have heard from other students around campus. The most pressing issue was transportation complications.

Specifically, students discussed the UGA bus system and its effectiveness. Many members weighed in on the issue of overcrowding at bus stops, especially at the East Campus Village stop.

Hevener addressed concerns and said she, along with Byers and SGA Treasurer Nav Singh, have already met with UGA Transportation and Parking Services to discuss the issue.

Hevener said the housing of first-year students in the University Village graduate apartments has led the university to anticipate overcrowding in East Campus residence halls. According to Hevener, alterations were made to the stops and bus routes to make the bus system more efficient.

Byers added that UGA TPS mentioned making a change to the bus stop by Ramsey Student Center. While she said that option had been discussed, no official plans have been announced.

SGA will hold an open forum discussion for all students to attend on Tuesday, Sept. 3. The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Miller Learning Center."
The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Read more: How This Bull Market Will End

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

Then and now: what senior Tories say about proroguing parliament,https://www.theguardian.com,['Simon Murphy'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/then-and-now-what-senior-tories-say-about-proroguing-parliament,"A few weeks ago they were dead-set against, but now their positions are a lot less clear

Then and now: what senior Tories say about proroguing parliament

“Absolutely outrageous.” “Not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century.” “A mad suggestion.”

The idea of suspending parliament to force through Brexit provoked unequivocal condemnation from senior Conservatives just weeks ago, with ministers falling over themselves to express their horror.

Now, after Boris Johnson moved to prorogue the Commons for five weeks ahead of the UK’s EU departure date of 31 October, his ministers’ once-steely opposition has turned to a more tight-lipped approach.

The Guardian hotfooted it to Whitehall in an attempt to get answers from ministers on their apparent U-turns, which follow on from strongly worded statements earlier in the summer.

Nicky Morgan

Nicky Morgan

Proroguing parliament is clearly a mad suggestion” – 6 June

I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister” – Thursday

The newly appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Nicky Morgan, told the BBC’s Question Time programme in June that proroguing parliament was “clearly a mad suggestion”.

“You cannot say you are going to take back control … and then go: ‘Oh, by the way, we are just going to shut parliament down for a couple of months, so we are just going to drift out on a no deal,’” she said.

But on Thursday morning, when the Guardian spotted Morgan strolling past the gates of Downing Street, it was a different story. Asked to clarify her position on proroguing parliament given her previous opposition, she said: “I’m a member of the cabinet, I fully support the prime minister.”

Pressed again on whether she still harboured doubts about the plan as the Guardian struggled to keep pace with her along Parliament Street, she repeated firmly: “I support the prime minister.”

When asked to respond to critics’ suggestion that proroguing parliament represented an affront to democracy, she said nothing and walked away.

Matt Hancock

Prorogation would mean the end of the Conservative party” – 6 June

Morning, how are you? Sorry. How are you?” – Thursday

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was once a vigorous opponent of the concept of prorogation, so much so that he wrote a letter during the Tory leadership campaign pledging to rule out the option and urging other candidates to do the same. “To suspend parliament explicitly to pursue a course of action against its wishes is not a serious policy of a prime minister in the 21st century,” he wrote.

The letter, dated 6 June, added: “A policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.”

Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) Proroguing Parliament undermines parliamentary democracy and risks a general election. I rule it out and call on all candidates to do the same pic.twitter.com/4aaAK3Tq8M

Giving a speech during the campaign four days later, Hancock referenced war veterans saying that proroguing parliament would go against “everything that those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for”. He added: “And I will not have it.”

Now, apparently, he will. Asked by the Guardian to clarify whether his position had changed, his spokesman failed to comment. Caught by reporters earlier in the day outside his house, he dodged their questions and hurried to his car. “Morning, how are you?” he replied. “Sorry. How are you?”

Michael Gove

Michael Gove

It would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy” – 9 June

Parliamentarians will have plenty of time to debate Brexit” – Wednesday

Leave-supporting Michael Gove has also spoken out against suspending parliament. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show in early June: “Proroguing parliament in order to try and get no deal through, I think would be wrong.”

Gove, appointed chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by Johnson last month, added: “I think it would be wrong for many reasons. I think it would not be true to the best traditions of British democracy.”

The Guardian found a gaggle of remain protesters gathered outside the Cabinet Office at lunchtime, where Michael Gove was meeting union leaders from Unite and GMB to discuss their concerns about the “catastrophic” impact of a no-deal Brexit on Britain’s manufacturing industry.

He did not do much to allay their fears, it seems. Jude Brimble, the national secretary of the GMB Union’s manufacturing section, labelled the government’s approach “lastminute.com”.

Unite’s assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, condemned proroguing parliament, calling it an outrage and a silencing mechanism.

Asked to clarify his position, Gove’s spokesman pointed the Guardian to an interview he conducted with the BBC on Wednesday. Pressed on whether proroguing parliament was a political attempt to stop debate on Brexit and block MPs from preventing the country leaving the EU without a deal, Gove replied: “It’s certainly not. The prime minister is clear that he wants to use a new parliamentary session in order to ensure that the people’s priorities are met. It’s also the case that parliamentarians will have plenty of time when we come back next week to debate Brexit.”

Amber Rudd

Amber Rudd

Nobody should consider involving the Queen” – 16 June

I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department” – Thursday



The work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, described suspending of parliament as “absolutely outrageous” in June. “To consider closing parliament is the most extraordinary idea I’ve ever heard,” she said. “It is a ridiculous suggestion. For a start it would involve approaching the Queen ... nobody should consider doing that.”

Did she still think approaching the Queen would be an outrage when Jacob Rees-Mogg went to see her on Wednesday? Such questions did not seem to please her during a visit to Belfast. Still, at least she retained a laser-like focus on her day job.

Asked about proroguing parliament, she replied: “I’m here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department, how people are helping people into work. And what I’ve seen today has been really reassuring.” Asked again about the suspension of parliament as she got into a waiting car, she said: “I’m going to continue doing my job as secretary of state for work and pensions.” Her spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

Sajid Javid

Sajid Javid

You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy” – 16 June

No comment” – Thursday

The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was also staunchly opposed to shutting down parliament during the Tory leadership campaign. “You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy ... we are not selecting a dictator of our country,” he said. As the Guardian surveilled the Treasury, Javid was nowhere to be seen to explain his position. Nor did his spokeswoman answer its questions. he also seemed to be absent from the airwaves.

On the proroguing of parliament, a government spokesperson said: “We are currently in the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years and it’s crucial that we put a bold and ambitious domestic programme to MPs so that we can deliver on people’s priorities across the country. To do this we need a Queen’s speech. This is about providing parliament with a new legislative programme that will help the NHS, fight crime, invest in infrastructure and cut the cost of living.

“As we have said previously, prorogation to suspend parliament, to block MPs further consideration of Brexit is not something we support. MPs will sit next week, the week after, the week before EU council, and two weeks after. Not only that, but the government will put its entire domestic agenda, and inevitably its approach to Brexit, to the vote as part of the Queen’s speech, with major votes on 21 and 22 October.”

Back outside the Cabinet Office, Brimble was furious about ministers’ change of tack. “They’re playing politics with people’s lives, they’re playing politics with people’s livelihoods,” she said. “They’re playing politics with the future of this country to appease the Brexiters in the Tory party.”"
"Beshear: Labor Cabinet finds 1,000 mine employees may be risk",https://www.lex18.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.lex18.com/news/beshear-labor-cabinet-finds-1-000-mine-employees-may-be-risk,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (LEX 18) — Attorney General Andy Beshear says that the state Labor Cabinet may have failed to secure a single bond for any mining company operating in the state.

According to a press conference held by Beshear, a review conducted by his office found that as many as 30 mining companies should have bonds on file. None of them do.

The investigation was initiated after it was learned that Blackjewel in Harlan County had not secured a bond for their workers. After the mine closed July 1, miners’ paychecks bounced and they have not been paid since.

As Blackjewel closed without the secure bond, they have not been required to pay their employees. In response, many of the former miners are staging a protests by blocking coal trains from passing through the region.

“In response to Blackjewel’s closing, the Labor Cabinet claimed ‘there is no mechanism in law for them to figure out when a new company has opened in the state that is supposed to post a bond,’ but my office was able to determine this with publicly available information within a few days,” Beshear said. “The Labor Cabinet has an absolute duty to enforce the law and has utterly failed to do so. They must begin enforcing these bonds to assure no one ever goes through what the Blackjewel miners are going through.”

Beshear also noted that Bevin's administration urged lawmakers to pass legislation that would eliminate the requirement. The bill did not receive a vote on the floor of the state House after it was released from committee.

The Labor Cabinet released the following statement, ""The full force of the Labor Cabinet is presently directed toward the recovery of unpaid wages for the coal miners affected by the Blackjewel bankruptcy. It’s curious that the Attorney General is just now weighing in with his after-the-fact advice. The Labor Cabinet has been working since July 5, when it was first made aware of the failure of Blackjewel to issue earned wages to coal miners, to get the miners paid. Conveniently, the Attorney General fails to mention that two of the five years included in his “look back” period were during his father’s administration.

"A Tory minister has been caught telling the truth? Don’t panic, it was only an accident",https://www.independent.co.uk,['Tom Peck'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/ben-wallace-boris-johnson-brexit-prorogation-dominic-cummings-coup-a9084321.html,"Ben Wallace was the longest-serving security minister in this country’s history. For three years he led this nation’s fight against terror in all its ever-changing technological forms.

So it is a little concerning that in that time nobody got round to briefing him on what it is that a television camera and a lapel microphone actually do.

Indeed he has every right to feel let down by the department, the Ministry of Defence, to be exact, that he now runs.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Someone, really, should have let him know, that if you have consented to the wearing of a microphone, and are standing in the full glare of a television news camera, it is not, perhaps the most auspicious time for some light-hearted small talk that will fatally undermine your own government’s 48-hour media lying strategy.

Only the day before, there had been Boris Johnson, grinning his way through claims that he was absolutely, definitely, only proroguing parliament to get on with his minority government’s “new, exciting legislative agenda”, absolutely none of which can possibly pass through the House of Commons.

And then, on Thursday morning, there was Jacob Rees-Mogg on the Today programme, still unable to get his fob watch back in his pocket after his trip to Balmoral to see the Queen, claiming that the longest suspension of parliament since 1945 was in fact “routine” and “quite boring”.

So what was Ben Wallace doing, the fifth most senior minister in the cabinet, at a meeting in Helsinki, telling his French counterpart that, in fact, this whole prorogation thing really was all about Brexit?

“Parliament has been very good at saying what it doesn’t want but it has been awful at saying what it wants. That’s the reality,” he told her, over a polite chuckle.

“So you know any leader has to, you know, try. I don’t know what the outcome of it will be. Oh... politics.”

Oh, politics indeed... lol. Politics, which in the UK has come to mean little more than the industrialisation of lying. Just what will the outcome be? Who knows? Ben Wallace certainly doesn’t.

Indeed, how did Mr Wallace not come by the memo? Which is to say, if you’re a Tory cabinet minister, whenever you spot a TV camera, whatever you do, don’t tell the truth.

It’s not like this is a new diktat either. It certainly predates the Boris Johnson era.

The news programmes have not struggled, in the last 24 hours, to dig up all sorts of footage of all kinds of Tories, looking into a television camera and telling all kinds of porkies.

There’s one of Matt Hancock, from just a few months ago, saying prorogation of parliament would be an affront to the men who died at Dunkirk, and, he adds, with staccato certainty, “I. Will. Not. Have. It.”

Except, it turns out, he will have it. Because he’s not resigned, he’s still in the cabinet, and parliament’s very much still being prorogued.

There’s Amber Rudd, sitting on Hastings pier, saying it would be “outrageous to consider proroguing parliament. We are not Stuart kings”. And yet, she’s only gone and done it.

There’s Sajid Javid, at the Tory leadership hustings, saying, “You don’t deliver democracy by trashing democracy.” He’s the chancellor of the exchequer now and somehow, by way of a miracle really, it has become trashed.

There’s Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Nicky Morgan. Anyway, I could go on for some time but we’ll limit it to just one more, kind of crucial one.

Dominic Cummings, the Brexit brain egg, the man whose great genius is the altar on which the reputation of the country must be laid. The Oracle. The post-politics politician. The guy who is, let’s face it, too clever for democracy.

The great visionary who has emerged from his long years buried in Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War only to find he has slipped the surly bonds of Other People’s Opinions, not to say, the British parliamentary system.

It’s just that I could have sworn I saw him wandering out of his house three weeks ago, Vote Leave tote bag over his shoulder, reactolite lenses blackening under the glare from his own soul, stopping to tell Sky News that, “Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect. That’s the critical issue.”

And indeed it is the critical issue. It is the uncertain foundation of our way of life. And yet, this country had a general election in 2017. It was fully informed by the EU referendum that had occurred a year before it. Theresa May went around the country, telling the voters with terrifying singularity to “strengthen my hand in the negotiations with Brussels”.

And the voters declined to do it. They returned a hung parliament, one that will not sanction a no-deal Brexit, so Cummings and Johnson have had a think. They’ve decided they know best and chucked it out.

But at least we can know that Cummings got the memo.

“Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect. That is the critical issue.”

It’s not as grand a lie as the rest. It may even have been a mere oversight, which we are only too glad to correct. Politicians don’t get to choose which votes they respect, apart from me."
"I've taught US government for 40 years. Thanks to Trump, I'm doubting the Founders' plan.",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Ross K. Baker', 'Opinion Columnist', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/08/30/donald-trump-makes-me-doubt-founders-checks-and-balances-column/2132691001/,"I now hesitate to defend the 'genius' of the Framers. I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances they said would keep us on track.

The day after Labor Day, I will stand behind a lectern in a lecture hall on the campus of Rutgers University and teach a course that I have taught for 40 years. I have always approached the first day eager to teach about the establishment of our republic and how government works today. In the past three years, the eagerness has curdled into apprehension as I debate with myself how even-handed I should be in dealing with a national government that I can no longer recognize, much less approve of.

It would be pointless for me and boring for the students to spend the semester assailing President Donald Trump for casting public service as contemptible with his unjustified disparagement of everyone from scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His contaminating influence has even spread beyond the executive branch to transform the United States Senate, an institution that I have long revered, into a pitiable amen corner that either assents to his most outrageous statements or passively cringes in silence.

Whom did they learn that from?: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.

I am now hesitant defending what I used to refer to as the “genius” of the framers of the Constitution because I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances that James Madison assured us were “auxiliary precautions” to prevent our government from going off the rails at times when the wisdom of the American people is faulty. The faultiness of that wisdom is, in my mind, on vivid display by the man they chose to lead the nation.

Serious flaws in the political system

It is hard for me now, in discussing the voting behavior of Americans, to grasp what kind of desperation prompted so many of my fellow citizens to choose and now enthusiastically support a man who has degraded the office of the presidency. How can American citizens in whom sovereignty resides have acted so irresponsibly? I will grant, however, that the alternative was not a good one. But that also speaks to serious flaws in the system.

I have searched for historical examples to reassure the students, and myself, that we have sometimes made poor choices in the men we have elected president, but that the damage that they inflicted on the country was slight and things turned out all right. I find it harder these days to use these historical examples, because they were part of a different time in which partisan strife was not so intractable and there were individuals who enjoyed universal respect to whom we could turn to help right the ship. Recently, people looked hopefully on the the prospect of William Barr as attorney general — another Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus perhaps — only to see him mutate into a stooge for the president.

More distressing even than lacking good people to restore the nation such as in the aftermath of Watergate and Richard Nixon’s resignation has been the failure of those exiting the Trump administration to speak openly about the mismanagement, capriciousness and venality of the president and his entourage.

Many individuals who spoke privately about Trump’s ignorance and caprice, such as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, slunk silently into retirement without getting on the record their obvious contempt for Trump. Even the vaunted truth-teller Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose departure was attributed to policy differences with the president, has not aired those differences so that the public could be able to evaluate whose version was the more credible.

Pulling my punches on Trump

Few of our past presidents were wholly conversant with constitutional law, but most seemed to be wary of the electrified wires of the system of separation of powers that defined limits they dared not transgress. Attributing to President Trump the most innocent interpretation of his abuses of power, such as the recent order to American companies to leave China, he has been exposed as a constitutional imbecile.

Just for the looks: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too.

More ominously, he is a man with dictatorial tendencies that exceed even of those past presidents most contemptuous of checks and balances. He has elevated the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership to a level above that of the First Amendment’s protection against the abridgment of a free press, and he tampers dangerously with the 14th Amendment’s clear message on birthright citizenship.

Ultimately, I will probably pull my punches because I don’t want to come across as a scold, and I will temper my words because I don’t want to give my students the idea that all is lost. It would be truly be the worst message of all.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga will likely retain their posts at a cabinet reshuffle in September, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he plans to reshuffle his cabinet next month, and that he will emphasize “stability” and “consistency” in the new line-up, signaling that he will keep key positions unchanged.

Aso and Suga have both served their current positions since Abe took power in a landslide election victory in late 2012."

During a regular daily news briefing, in which he usually expounds on everything from history and economics to culture, Lopez Obrador said the device had been found in a room used for meetings in the National Palace, his headquarters.

“Just imagine, they’ve been recording us in a meeting room, here in the Palace,” the president said as he reflected on the importance of free speech and transparency.

Lopez Obrador, who didn’t provide details on the camera or how it came to be there, said he had no secrets.

“What we talk about is completely legal, transparent, and there’s nothing that could be used against us,” he said.

During the presidential campaign last year, Lopez Obrador said he and his family were the victims of spying. Upon taking office in December, he put an end to the former national intelligence agency CISEN, giving the body a new name.

Lopez Obrador has accused previous governments of lacking transparency and suppressing dissent. He frequently blames negative reports about his administration on efforts by unnamed “adversaries” and “conservatives” to thwart his agenda.

"Nigeria's Buhari assigns cabinet portfolios, appoints new oil minister",https://www.reuters.com,"['Felix Onuah', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-politics/nigerias-buhari-assigns-cabinet-portfolios-appoints-new-oil-minister-idUSKCN1VB1F9,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa’s top producer of crude oil.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country’s main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria’s emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

“The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,” Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country’s ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

“We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February’s election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party’s base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

“There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,” said Liewerscheidt."
Litigation against executive branch by coalitions of states grows in response to unilateral actions by president and gridlocked Congress,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution']",08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/litigation-against-executive-branch-by-coalitions-of-states-grows-in-response-to-unilateral-actions-by-president-and-gridlocked-congress/2019/08/24/34267560-c5bf-11e9-b72f-b31dfaa77212_story.html,"Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."

"U.S. emoluments clauses are the real ‘America First’ policy, but Trump ignores them",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Jamie Raskin', 'A Democrat', 'Represents Maryland S District In The U.S. House Of Representatives', 'Serves On The Judiciary', 'Oversight Committees. He Is An Emeritus Professor Of Constitutional Law At American University S Washington College Of Law.']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/28/whats-trumps-idea-america-first-g-cash-flowing-his-golf-resort/,"

President Trump speaks at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Monday. (Markus Schreiber/AP)

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. He is an emeritus professor of constitutional law at American University’s Washington College of Law.

President Trump thinks he has found the perfect site for the 2020 Group of Seven summit: the Trump National Doral golf resort. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it,” he said from this year’s G-7 gathering in France.

His choice wasn’t exactly astonishing, considering that since he took office, Trump has visited his business properties at taxpayer expense 362 times; there have been 630 visits to Trump properties by at least 250 Trump administration officials, including White House staff members, Cabinet members and agency employees; and visits to Trump properties have been made by 111 officials representing 65 foreign governments, all according to a report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

[Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.]

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

[Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.]

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."
Halep ‘not inspired at all’ in US Open defeat,https://www.malaymail.com,[],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2019/08/30/halep-not-inspired-at-all-in-us-open-defeat/1785695,"Simona Halep of Romania reacts against Taylor Townsend of the US during their Women’s Singles second-round match at the 2019 US Open in New York August 29, 2019. — AFP pic

NEW YORK, Aug 30 — Simona Halep said she was “not inspired at all” in yesterday’s US Open loss to 116th-ranked American qualifier Taylor Townsend as her miserable run in New York continued.

The reigning Wimbledon champion saved a pair of match points but then failed to convert one in the final set of a 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) defeat.

“I was not inspired at all today, but I fought. I thought when I came back that I will take it and I will win it. But sometimes it goes the other way,” Halep said, digesting another early Flushing Meadows exit following first-round losses in 2017 and 2018.

“I’m used to it. It’s the third year. I’m disappointed. I had expectations from myself that I’m confident and I feel the game. But today was different. I was very close. I had match ball. But, you know, sometimes it happens.

“She played really well. She really deserved to win it because she gave everything and she didn’t think of losing. She went all the way with 100 percent belief.”

Fourth seed Halep, whose best US Open run came when she reached the semi-finals in 2015, admitted she struggled to cope with Townsend’s committed serve-and-volley approach.

“Never, never. I never played with someone coming so often to the net,” Halep said.

“She was way more inspired than me. Many balls I hit on the sides, she was there. That’s why I say I was not inspired. I played all the time where she was.”

Halep had not dropped a set in three previous meeting with Townsend, whose victory over the Romanian represented her first over a top-10 player.

The most recent of those clashes came last March in Miami, where Halep imparted some friendly advice to Townsend after she inflicted a 6-1, 6-3 defeat on her.

“After we played together, she came in the locker room and she asked me what she has to improve to be better. So she did it today,” Halep said, with a wry smile. “Next time I will not say anything.

“I played few times against her, and I knew how she’s playing,” she added.

“But today she changed. She went for all the balls to the net. So it was a little bit different. At one point I lost the rhythm in the second set, and I didn’t really know what I have to change. Even the touch, I didn’t have it.

“But always when you play with a top player, you have nothing to lose.” — AFP"

"The executive branch's job is to enforce laws, not make them",https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/457996-the-executive-branchs-job-is-to-enforce-laws-not-make-them,"The Trump administration unveiled two controversial sets of regulations last week. One narrows the eligibility criteria for legal immigrant status. The other eases protections for threatened and endangered species. Both policies face legal challenges.

People can legitimately debate whether these rules make sense as a matter of policy and politics. The environmental regulations arguably do more to protect big business than animal species, while the new immigration regulations make it even harder for migrants to remain in the United States legally.

As a personal matter, judges might like or dislike these outcomes. But as a professional matter, some judges believe that, under the Constitution, only Congress has the express power to make laws — not agencies that answer to the president. These judges tend to be ideologically conservative. Will that crowd join progressives to criticize the new regulations, albeit for different reasons?

ADVERTISEMENT

Not likely.

The argument against agency lawmaking was articulated most recently by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He wrote the dissenting opinion in Gundy v. United States, a case involving lawmaking by the attorney general regarding the national sex offender registry. Gorsuch eloquently argued that lawmaking power belongs to Congress, and for good reason. Unlike career bureaucrats within the executive branch, Congress is democratically accountable to the people if they wind up making bad laws. Executive branch officials are supposed enforce the law, not create it. This is because — with the exception of the president — the people get no say in hiring and firing those in the executive branch.

To be sure, President Trump Donald John TrumpAdvocate calls for fundamental shift in criminal justice system Shame on Europe at the G-7 Senate GOP pledges to oppose any efforts to 'pack' Supreme Court MORE campaigned on aggressive elimination of federal regulations — which is a longstanding GOP objective — and has held to this promise. Proponents of deregulation argue that the federal administrative bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and that regulation of free markets is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. Everyone does better if the markets are allowed to function unimpeded by bureaucrats who wind up blocking progress and innovation.

That’s a fine position to take, of course — so long as what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. The problem with the conservative argument against lawmaking by agencies is that it’s often — and conveniently — abandoned once an agency does something that conservatives like politically.

Department of Commerce v. New York involved lawmaking by the Department of Commerce regarding the contents of the U.S. Census form. The Constitution gives the power to implement the Census to Congress — not the president. Congress handed that power off to the secretary of Commerce in a statute called the Census Act. Although this is what Congress did in the statute challenged in Gundy — to Gorsuch’s chagrin — he said nary a peep about the hand-off of legislative power in the Census Act.

Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Either delegation of lawmaking power by Congress to the executive branch is constitutionally acceptable or it is not.

One might argue that deregulation is taking regulations off the books, so it doesn’t involve lawmaking, and is less constitutionally objectionable. But that’s not what the Trump administration’s environmental and immigration regulations do. They make new laws.

Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act. It provides that “the Secretary shall by regulation . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species.” That language is the “hand-off” of legislative power from Congress to the secretary of the Department of Commerce, whom today happens to be Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossHillicon Valley: Court delays ruling against Qualcomm | Google asks employees not to talk politics at work | Facebook releases early emails discussing Cambridge Analytica | Bannon to release anti-Huawei film Bannon to release anti-Huawei film 'Claws of the Red Dragon' Trump administration announces deal to avert tariffs on Mexican tomatoes MORE.

The statute then gives Ross a bunch of factors to use in deciding whether a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization of the species for commercial or other purposes, disease or predation, inadequate regulations or “other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.”

The agency’s regulations add new factors to this list, including the requirement that a threatened species must become endangered “within the foreseeable future.” For that determination, the agency must now consider factors like “threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability.”

The immigration regulations are no less constitutionally objectionable. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the secretary of Homeland Security the power to “establish . . . regulations” to implement the statute. (Again, that’s the “hand-off.”) The statute also states that “any alien who . . . is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible,” and provides a list of factors for use in deciding if someone is a “public charge,” including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills.

Once again, the agency’s new regulations add new factors to this list, defining “public charge” to also capture “any alien who receives one or more public benefits,” including federally-funded benefits such as housing assistance and Medicaid.

Handing off legislative power to agencies is not considered unconstitutional under current Supreme Court case law, and there are good reasons for tolerating the practice.

But if conservative judges are going to complain about them, they should do so across-the-board. The leaders of the agencies involved in these rulemakings were never on the ballot for the offices they hold. Voters who don’t like these laws cannot go to the polls and fire them. This is precisely why Gorsuch and other conservative judges have balked at lawmaking by agencies. It messes with the separation of powers.

The question for conservatives is this: If either of these laws were to reach the Supreme Court, would Gorsuch kvetch that this particular lawmaking by executive branch agencies is constitutionally objectionable? Or would he stay silent — as in the Census case — leaving us to wonder whether his constitutional purity is contingent on conservative ideology and politics?

Because if it’s the latter, then we might have politicians on the Supreme Court after all.

Re: “Former governor considers Senate run,” Aug. 14 news story

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Epstein’s fate

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

What is the G7? Here's the History of the Conference,https://time.com,['Julia Webster'],,,,https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate.

Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders.

What does G7 stand for?

G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Why was G7 created?

The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy.

France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding.

Which countries are members of the G7?

The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population.

The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.

This would have been Juncker’s last G7, as he is soon to be replaced by his successor, Ursula von der Leyen, following the European elections that took place in May. However, on Monday it was announced that Juncker will not travel to Biarritz for the summit since he needs to continue his recovery after having had emergency surgery at the weekend.

Why was Russia kicked out of the G8?

Russia was kicked out of the then G8 in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which was seen by leaders as a “violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

President Barack Obama and other world leaders announced in a joint statement, titled The Hague Declaration, in March 2014 that they would cancel that year’s planned meeting in Sochi, Russia.

“Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi summit,” the statement said. “We will suspend our participation in the G8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, a few days before his departure for the summit, Donald Trump said Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 group. “I think it’s much more appropriate to have Russia in. It should be the G8 because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,” he said.

Next year it will be the turn of the United States to host the G7.

What’s the difference between G7 and G20?

They have similar names and similar functions. While the G7 mainly has to do with politics, the G20 is a broader group that focuses on the global economy. It’s also known as the “Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy” and represents 80% of global GDP.

It gathers leaders from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union.

Founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, the G20 started off as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. However, as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 was upgraded to head of state level in an inaugural summit in Washington, D.C.

This year’s G20 was chaired by Japan. The 2019 Osaka summit was the 14th meeting of the G20, held on 28-29 June 2019.

Health Canada has issued a recall on thousands of cooktops because of a potential fire hazard.

A release from the federal agency says the heating elements on the cooktops may energize without any user input.

The recall affects about 3,000 products produced by the Tennessee-based Whirlpool Corporation under the Whirlpool, KitchenAid and JennAir brands.

Health Canada says no injuries have been reported in this country, although there has been one report of cabinet damage due to the cooktop being on for a long time.

In the U.S., where more than 20,000 of the affected units were sold, two people have reported suffering minor burns.

Anyone who owns one of the products is advised to immediately contact Whirlpool for a free replacement.

Trump Wants Next G7 Summit at His Hotel That Settled Bed Bugs Lawsuit?,https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trumps-hotel-g7-settle-lawsuit/,"U.S. President Donald Trump perhaps inadvertently focused international attention on a lawsuit over bed bugs at one of his resorts when he first suggested that the 2020 G7 summit should be held at that resort. He then tweeted that a claim about the golf resort having issues with bed bugs was a “made up Radical Left Story.”

A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs, but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them! Been calling me wrong for years, along with the few remaining Never Trumpers – All Losers! https://t.co/KlzzMC40Vt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019



Trump made the suggestion about Doral on Aug. 27, 2019, while in Biarritz, the French resort town that was the site of the 2019 G7 summit, where influential world leaders gathered. “People are really liking it and plus it has buildings that have 50 to 70 units,” he said about Doral. “And so each delegation can have its own building.”

Talk of Doral renewed attention on a lawsuit filed against the resort. Court records show that Trump’s Doral resort near Miami was sued in July 2016 by Eric Linder, a guest who checked in to Doral in early March 2016 to attend a trade convention.

According to the lawsuit complaint, Linder awoke shortly after he arrived to “multiple welts, lumps and marks over much of his face, neck, arms and torso,” at which point he complained to the resort staff. Linder was then informed the room he was in tested positive for bed bugs. Per the lawsuit complaint, the property had a “history of severe bed bug infestation,” which was either not treated or was done so inadequately.

According to a court document filed by a mediator, an “agreement was reached” between the parties on Jan. 24, 2017. Linder, according to news reports, is barred from discussing the details of the settlement by a confidentiality agreement.

Before the bed bugs scandal hit the news, Trump was already facing scrutiny for his statement that next year’s G7 would be held at his own resort location, which raises ethical issues about the president using the public office to enrich his private interests. Trump’s extensive business network and how he has used it in office have been the source of ongoing controversy over questions about conflicts of interest."
