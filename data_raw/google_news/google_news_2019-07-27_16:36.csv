President Donald Trump Calls For Investigation Into Obama Book Deals,https://deadline.com,['Bruce Haring'],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://deadline.com/2019/07/president-donald-trump-obama-book-dealls-investigation-1202655260/,"Frustrated by continued efforts by the Democratic congress to find a reason to impeach him, President Donald Trump fought back today, saying that an investigation should be mounted on the book deals signed by former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.

The $65 million in multiple book deals spawned a best-seller for Michelle Obama, with Barack Obama’s memoir scheduled for some time next year.

Trump, speaking in the White House Oval Office on Friday, also called for an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, and put in a jab against Obama for ruining the White House air conditioning system, which he says can’t maintain a comfortable temperature.

The irritation by Trump was likely in response to the Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee stating that they were conducting an “impeachment investigation,” even after obtaining little new information from their big move, this week’s interrogation of Robert Mueller.

The Democrats today are now turning to have Mueller’s secret grand jury materials unsealed.

“All they want to do is impede. They want to investigate. They want to go fishing. And I watched Bob Mueller, and they have nothing,” Trump said. “There’s no collusion there’s no obstruction they have nothing. It’s a disgrace.”"
Donald Trump's most catastrophic decision,https://www.cnn.com,['David A. Andelman'],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/27/opinions/donald-trumps-most-catastrophic-decision-andelman/index.html,"(CNN) It's hard to single out any one event as the most cataclysmic of Donald Trump's presidency, in terms of American and global security. There was his bolting from the Iran nuclear deal (and Iran's subsequent resumption of uranium enrichment). There was baiting Kim Jong Un, followed by engagement, which will likely result in a more advanced North Korean nuclear program. Then, of course, there's the end to American participation in climate-change mitigation, not to mention a trade war with China.

But if I were to identify one event that could well have the most catastrophic results over the long term, it is Trump's ill-considered decision to ditch the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Agreement with Russia. That action will come full on Friday, August 2, when the United States, having given its six-month notice, will be out of it entirely, and the treaty utterly void. The result? Likely another unparalleled arms race, a growth in global insecurity, and a tacit license for more countries to seek nukes of their own.

At the moment it was negotiated in 1986, as explained in the book by historian and journalist Guillaume Serina that I translated from the French, "" An Impossible Dream: Reagan, Gorbachev and a World Without the Bomb ,"" the US was far better positioned for a major arms race than was the Soviet Union — a reality that both US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but especially the latter, understood. That is certainly no longer the case.

Still, there are certain constants that are as true, and perilous, today as they were then. In the 1980s, nuclear-armed missiles of various ranges were proliferating with few checks on their numbers or lethality.

Intermediate range nuclear (INF) missiles were originally based in Europe, but with the proliferation of nuclear forces in Asia, were beginning to pose a series of global and regional challenges.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were largely the domain of the United States and the Soviet Union. These were at the heart of the Cold War nuclear standoff and the often-tense peace guaranteed by the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (which held that if one side attacked, the other would respond, and both sides would be destroyed — a dynamic that deterred anyone from launching a first strike). And, of course, there was always the ultimate fear of a horrific error in judgment or technology.

So from the early 1970s into the 2000s, a succession of discussions was held between the two superpowers that led to treaties designed to put a cap on the numbers and lethality of these weapons that both sides recognized were the surest path to Armageddon. SALT I and SALT II (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks), signed in 1972 and 1979, placed caps on the numbers of intercontinental ballistic missiles.

That still left, largely unrestrained, all intermediate range (INF) missiles, based in Europe and the Soviet Union. This was the goal of the summit held in Reykjavik, Iceland, between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1986, when the Soviet leader sprang on an astonished US president a proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons held by both sides. The catch? Reagan would have to end his ""Star Wars"" missile-defense system. He refused. The meeting ended with no agreement. Still, it was a landmark moment — the closest the world has ever approached to an end to all nuclear arms.

But neither side was prepared to give up. The discussions that began in Reykjavik led to other, more modest but enduring nuclear pacts, along two tracks that have stood the test of time. The most immediate result of Reykjavik was the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed December 8, 1987, whose provisions eliminated all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. But its precedent-shattering provision was an intrusive system of on-site inspections, laying the groundwork for verification of new ICBM treaties — the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I, which arrived seven years later, and New C, which exists today. These slashed the number of deployed nuclear warheads from 6,000 under START I to 1,550 today.

While neither has managed to prevent the slow and equally destabilizing arrival of new nuclear powers (China, India, Pakistan, Israel, eventually North Korea, and possibly someday Iran), both sets of treaties — Start and INF — have very much stood the test of time. Until now.

Last fall, Trump, who arrived with his tortured sense of East-West rivalry and American supremacy, suddenly and arbitrarily announced his intention to pull out of the centerpiece of the nuclear-arms-control process launched in the 1980s: the INF Treaty. When Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the INF treaty after the six-month window that ends August 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin took the opportunity to bolt from the treaty, too. Each side charged the other with violations — and with some justification. The problem is that Trump may not have recognized that today's Russia is quite different from Gorbachev's.

In February, Putin outlined the shape of this new world in his annual state-of-the-nation address. Behind him flashed video and animations of next-generation ICBMs, nuclear-powered hypersonic cruise missiles, underwater drones and other devices Russia had developed and that it now felt free to deploy. ""The capability of such weapons,"" he warned, ""will be equivalent to the threats against Russia.""

Indeed, with communism dead, the new proto-capitalist Russia, supported by high oil prices, is a more formidable enemy by far and, as Putin suggested, in a position to make good on threats once viewed as largely empty bluster from his Kremlin predecessors. The US is developing similar weapons, including hypersonic weapons able to travel nine times the speed of sound and largely impervious to any existing missile defense systems. American officials have conceded, however, that, while working diligently on such advances, the US is years away from testing and deployment, while Putin has at least claimed Russia will make its first deployments this year.

Despite all of Trump's braggadocio of ""rebuilding our military like we never have before,"" the US seems suddenly to find itself in the deeply uncomfortable and unprecedented position of playing catchup in an arms race where Russia could begin calling the shots.

At the same time, it leaves America's closest allies questioning the value of counting on a nuclear security umbrella controlled by the US, which has suddenly become an unpredictable and irrational partner, and whose leadership appears to be in disturbing agreement with their most pernicious enemy — Russia. It is little wonder that European leaders are moving toward creation of a European defense force. Once lost, the lead in any arms contest is only regained with enormous difficulty and at colossal cost.

Eliminating constraints on nuclear weapons is in no way a path toward a safer, more tranquil world. It is a path toward an unchecked arms race that is likely to suggest to any number of other nuclear aspirants that they need to field deterrent nuclear arsenals of their own. And from there, nuclear weapons would need to take only one small step to reach the hands of terrorists who know no restraints and care nothing of consequences.

The US still spends much more than any other country on weapons, but for the sake of our own security, we cannot afford an arms race with today's Russia. Nor can the world afford the decades it takes to negotiate any replacements to these treaties so hastily scrapped in such ill-conceived fashion.

"Trump slams ‘brutal bully’ Elijah Cummings, claims Baltimore district is ‘more dangerous’ than border",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-slams-brutal-bully-elijah-cummings-baltimore,"President Trump on Saturday branded Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., a “brutal bully” for his treatment of border patrol officials at committee hearings -- and described Cumming’s district as “far worse and more dangerous” than the southern border.

“Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous,” he tweeted Saturday morning.

CUMMINGS SAYS THERE IS 'NO DOUBT' TRUMP IS RACIST FOLLOWING CONTROVERSY OVER TWEETS

Trump was apparently referring to Cummings' questioning of border officials in his role as chairman of the House Oversight Committee. This month, he yelled at acting Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan for saying the department was doing its “level best” when it comes to the humanitarian crisis at the border.

""What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on man,” he yelled. “What's that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.""

Cummings later questioned whether there was an “empathy deficit,” a remark that appeared to anger McAleenan, who noted the agents make more than 4,000 rescues a year.

The comments may have also angered Trump, who on Saturday said that the detention centers at the border are “clean, efficient and well run, just very crowded.” He then compared that to the conditions in Cummings' district.

“Cumming[s'] District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,” Trump tweeted, before calling for an investigation into why Baltimore received so much federal funding.

EXCLUSIVE TOUR OF CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION FACILITY CONTRADICTS CLAIMS OF INHUMANE CONDITIONS, OVERCROWDING

“Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!""

Cummings responded later Saturday, saying it is his constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch: ""But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.""

""Just yesterday, I held a hearing on the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs and the financial hardships that families across the nation, and in Baltimore, are facing,"" he tweeted.

He went on to say that he wanted to address the problem with Trump, and referred to a conversation they had in 2017 about legislation to lower drug prices.

Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was ""completely unacceptable for the political leader of our country to denigrate a vibrant American City like Baltimore, and to viciously attack U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings a patriot and a hero.""

""Mr. Trump's rhetoric is hurtful and dangerous to the people he's sworn to represent,"" he said.

Cummings last week said that there was ""no doubt"" that Trump is a racist after the president's tweets about the four freshman congresswomen known as ""The Squad"" and said they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

“When I hear those things, it takes me back,” Cummings said in reference to segregation in the 1960s. Cummings went on to compare the president’s tweets to his own experience in 1960's Baltimore when he tried to integrate a public swimming pool.

“I heard the same kind of chants, ‘Go home, you don’t belong here,’” Cummings said on ABC's ""This Week."" “I’m not the only person of color who has had those kind of experiences.”"
New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."

At least that’s how Charles Leazott handled it. He woke up Thursday morning to find that a spoof presidential seal he created last year on “a lark” to vent his frustration with President Trump had ended up onstage next to the president himself.

The seal, which made allusions to Russia and golf, was included onscreen at a conservative event on Tuesday hosted by Turning Point USA. The mix-up was apparently the result of a rushed Google search."

Trump DOJ Sues BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik for $100 Million for Illicit Bitcoin Dealings

Alexander Vinnik bitcoin launderer BTC-e More

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Federal prosecutors charged him in 2017 with stealing Bitcoins from other virtual exchanges. U.S. authorities now seek to recover penalties of $100 million from Vinnik and his company, Bloomberg reported.

According to a prosecutors’ statement, Vinnik’s company is incorporated in Cyprus, or the Seychelles, or even both. Californian users, in addition to users from other places, used the exchange to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"

This has been one helluva ride, and it’s not over yet, but we are closer than ever. Now that the deal is done, what comes next? Let’s take a closer look at what we can expect going forward in the wireless industry.

This deal is just one slice of the pie when it comes to changes in the U.S. wireless marketplace. It used to be an industry full of wireless carriers like AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile and Sprint.

Over recent years we have seen other industries move into wireless and changing things. Think of companies like Comcast with Xfinity Mobile, Charter with Spectrum Mobile and Altice with Altice Mobile.

The wireless industry continues to change

Things are continuing to change. We have seen other companies like Amazon and Facebook try to enter wireless and fail. I think we can expect them and other companies to make another try.

DISH Network is a sudden newcomer to the wireless industry. Like DirecTV which was acquired by AT&T along with Time Warner or WarnerMedia, DISH sees the writing on the wall. With the entry of Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile and Altice Mobile is it becoming obvious if DISH wants to remain a player going forward, they must enter wireless.

Several years ago, DISH acquired wireless spectrum and they must use it or lose it. Since this is a real threat, and since other pay TV companies are also in the wireless business, it makes sense they acquire some of T-Mobile and Sprint wireless assets.

That way T-Mobile and Sprint win since they can complete their merger and DISH also wins, since they can now rapidly move into wireless. We will now watch and see how quickly they will move into the mobile space.

So, the next question is will DISH light off a huge firework display of rapid wireless innovation and growth or will they take a more gentile approach like Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile?

During the early days there was much speculation about Xfinity Mobile and Spectrum Mobile. Would they rapidly grow? Would they be a fierce competitor?

Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile not fierce competitor in wireless

Watching them over the last few years the answer is they are not a real competitive threat to traditional wireless competitors like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.

Rather, they are just using wireless as a defensive play, not an offensive one. They are using wireless as another leg on their stool hoping to hang onto their existing customer base. They are not really marketing this service like traditional wireless services have always done.

With that said, I would think when Altice Mobile launches, it will not be a major competitor either. And since these three pay TV companies are not using wireless as a growth engine, perhaps DISH will not either.

Wireless going through major transformation

Wireless is going through a major transformation and that will continue for years to come. Today, it looks like current leaders, AT&T and Verizon will remain in the leadership position going forward.

With this merger, T-Mobile and Sprint look stronger than ever. Finally, they have wireless spectrum and marketing power. They should remain a strong third-place competitor.

DISH is the next big question mark. Will they become a hot competitor to the big players, or will they take a more gentile approach like Xfinity and Spectrum?

This wireless industry transformation is still in the very early stages. At this point, this merger only really impacts T-Mobile and Sprint. The real action comes from where 5G will take this entire industry for years to come.

Other industries will use 5G to rapidly grow and transform life as we know it. Think of wireless pay TV. Think of wireless self-driving cars. Think of all the amazing new technology that has already come our way like Uber and Lyft and much more. Think of what tomorrow will look like on the 5G networks which have only just begun.

Wireless will continue to rapidly grow and change. Expect other companies in other industries to use wireless to grow in new ways. This is one of the most exciting times we have ever experienced, and we are just in the very early stages of this movie.

So, once again, congratulations to T-Mobile and Sprint. You now have the wireless spectrum and the marketing power to show growth as this industry moves into 5G. We’ll be watching all the fireworks and excitement."
Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
"Sprint, T-Mobile receive merger approval from Justice Department",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tony Romm', 'Senior Tech Policy Reporter', 'July At Pm', 'Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post. He Has Spent Nearly Ten Years Covering The Ways That Tech Companies Like Apple', 'Facebook', 'Google Navigate The Corridors Of Government --', 'The Regulations That Sometimes Result.']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/26/sprint-t-mobile-receive-merger-approval-department-justice/,"Federal regulators approved the $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint on Friday, setting the stage for a tectonic shift in the U.S. wireless industry at a moment when carriers are racing to deploy the next generation of ultrafast mobile service.

The green light from the antitrust watchdogs at the Justice Department marks a critical milestone in the long-running campaign by T-Mobile, the country’s third-largest carrier, to combine with Sprint, the fourth, and form a new telecom giant that is expected to serve more than 100 million subscribers nationally — rivaling the even larger footprints of AT&T and Verizon.

In selling their plans to Washington, T-Mobile and Sprint emphasized that only through merging could they build and deploy speedy 5G service nationwide, which they committed earlier this year to bringing to 97 percent of the U.S. over the next three years.

Justice Department officials still harbored competition concerns about the deal, fearing the loss of a major national wireless carrier would leave American consumers with too few choices — potentially resulting in higher prices. In response, the agency required T-Mobile and Sprint to sell critical elements of business to Dish Network, with the goal of positioning the satellite-television company as a new competitor in the wireless industry.

“We’ve reached a historic structural settlement with T-Mobile and Sprint after concluding their merger, without this remedy, would substantially harm competition,” said Makan Delrahim, the leader of the Justice Department’s antitrust division. “The remedies set up Dish as a disruptive force in wireless.”

Immediately, critics blasted the government for blessing even more consolidation among existing telecom behemoths. Dish pledged it would build out new wireless service to 70 percent of the country by 2023, but analysts expressed concern that the Englewood, Colo., company might never hit its target, given the sheer cost of building such 5G coverage at a moment when Dish has been shedding customers.

Those fears emboldened state attorneys general, including those in California and New York, who earlier this year sued T-Mobile and Sprint in a bid to stop them from merging. “We have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger’s harm to consumers, workers, and innovation,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Friday.

[T-Mobile acknowledges its patronage of Trump’s Washington hotel increased sharply after announcement of merger with Sprint]

For now, the Justice Department’s decision removes a significant federal hurdle that had been standing in the way of the two telecom giants, which had flirted for years over a potential tie-up but repeatedly abandoned their plans in the face of sustained Washington skepticism. Absent divestitures to Dish, the department said on Friday that it would have sued to stop the deal.

A federal judge still must approve the companies’ settlement with the Justice Department. The Federal Communications Commission also has to bless the deal, though that agency’s Republican leaders previously expressed public support for the two wireless giants’ plans — and signaled Friday their formal green light would come soon.

T-Mobile, which is operated by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, and Sprint, which is owned by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, announced their merger last April. Without such a combination, T-Mobile and Sprint said they could not muster the necessary investments individually to develop and deploy 5G services, putting them at a major disadvantage against AT&T and Verizon.

The two wireless carriers began pitching the deal to the FCC, which reviews mergers to see if they benefit the public, and the Justice Department, which studies competition, at a moment when Democrats and Republicans alike in Washington had started sounding new alarms about the dangers of corporate consolidation. In recent months, the merger attracted heightened attention from several presidential candidates, with Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) signing onto a letter that said it would result in “unacceptably high levels of concentration in an already consolidated wireless industry.”

Consumer groups such as Public Knowledge echoed those concerns, arguing a combined T-Mobile and Sprint would result in higher prices and fewer options for consumers. Many critics pointed to the fact that T-Mobile had already become a fierce competitor — offering more customer-friendly contracts, for example — precisely because the government had warded off an attempted merger by the two companies in the past.

But T-Mobile and Sprint offered concessions to reshape their merger in recent months in a bid to win over federal regulators. In May, the companies pledged to build out 5G wireless to most of the country, including much of rural America, while offering “same or better rate plans at the same or better prices” for the next three years. The announcement satisfied FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who warned the companies would “suffer serious consequences” if they break their promises.

To assuage the Justice Department, T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to divest key assets that would help Dish become a fourth national wireless carrier — including hundreds of retail stores, thousands of cell sites and licenses to the invisible airwaves, known as spectrum, that power wireless service. The merging companies also will give up their prepaid phone businesses, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.

The deal, which is valued at more than $5 billion, will allow Dish to offer service over T-Mobile’s network until it’s able to operate its own, Delrahim said. Existing spectrum holdings at Dish helped the companies sell their plan to the Justice Department, officials said Friday, and Dish must meet its build-out targets or face billions of dollars in federal penalties.

[T-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval. The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump’s hotel.]

“Taken together, these opportunities will set the stage for our entry as the nation’s fourth facilities-based wireless competitor and accelerate our work to launch the country’s first stand-alone 5G broadband network,” Charlie Ergen, the chairman and co-founder of Dish, said in a statement.

Some of the deal’s skeptics, however, said the companies’ concessions are unlikely to address their concerns: It could take too long for the sale of spectrum and other assets to Dish to result in a carrier able to compete with AT&T, Verizon and a merged T-Mobile and Sprint.

“A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It’s a mobile Frankenstein,” said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law & Policy.

The deal replaces a weak competitor in Sprint with a potentially weaker one in Dish, said Roger Entner, a wireless industry analyst and founder of Recon Analytics. The constraints on Dish’s business would prevent it from being able to price its services competitively, he said. Adding to Dish’s challenges, he said, consumers seem to care more about reputation than price in choosing a carrier.

Dish finished last year with 9.9 million satellite-TV subscribers, down more than 25 percent from five years ago, and less than half the total of its top rival, AT&T-owned DirecTV. The Dish-owned streaming service, Sling, finished the year with about 2.5 million subscribers.

Dish also saw a $320 million purchase of the Blockbuster video chain in 2011 fizzle, with the company closing nearly all stores just several years later.

Many Democrats also remained unconvinced. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said earlier this year she had “serious doubts” about consolidation in wireless. On Friday, she said, “I remain skeptical that this combination is good for consumers, good for competition, or good for the economy.”

Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner at the FCC, took a different view: “I think even without the Dish piece of this, our record was very clear about the consumer benefits that are going to derive from [the merger].”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after the president fired ex-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, testified that he was not involved in the approval chain for the final FISA renewal."

Justice Department Settles with T-Mobile and Sprint in Their Proposed Merger by Requiring a Package of Divestitures to Dish

Divestiture Will Enable DISH’s Entry as a Fourth Nationwide Facilities-Based Wireless Competitor and Expedite Deployment of High-Quality 5G for American Consumers

The Department of Justice announced today that it and the Attorneys General for five states reached a settlement with T-Mobile and Sprint regarding their proposed merger. The settlement requires a substantial divestiture package in order to enable a viable facilities-based competitor to enter the market. Further, the settlement will facilitate the expeditious deployment of multiple high-quality 5G networks for the benefit of American consumers and entrepreneurs.

The Department’s Antitrust Division, along with the offices of five state Attorneys General (Plaintiff States), filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed transaction. At the same time, the Department and the Plaintiff States filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Department’s and the Plaintiff States’ competitive concerns. The participating state Attorneys General offices represent Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

Under the terms of the proposed settlement, T-Mobile and Sprint must divest Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, and Sprint prepaid, to Dish Network Corp., a Colorado-based satellite television provider. The proposed settlement also provides for the divestiture of certain spectrum assets to Dish. Additionally, T-Mobile and Sprint must make available to Dish at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations. T-Mobile must also provide Dish with robust access to the T-Mobile network for a period of seven years while Dish builds out its own 5G network.

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amounts of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “Today’s settlement will provide Dish with the assets and transitional services required to become a facilities-based mobile network operator that can provide a full range of mobile wireless services nationwide. I want to thank our state partners for joining us in this settlement.” Delrahim added, “In crafting this remedy, we are also mindful of the significant commitments T-Mobile, Sprint, and Dish have made to the Federal Communications Commission.”

The Department and the Plaintiff States said that, without the divestiture, the proposed acquisition would eliminate competition between two of only four facilities-based suppliers of nationwide mobile wireless services. According to the complaint, T-Mobile and Sprint both operate mobile networks and offer nationwide coverage to consumers, and they are particularly close competitors to each other for the roughly 30% of retail subscribers who purchase prepaid mobile wireless service. The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint would eliminate head-to-head competition between the companies and threaten the benefits that customers have realized from that competition in the form of lower prices and better service.

T-Mobile US Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. In 2018, T-Mobile posted revenues of more than $43 billion. Deutsche Telekom AG, a German corporation headquartered in Bonn, Germany, is the controlling shareholder of T-Mobile US Inc.

Sprint Corporation is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. In 2018, its posted revenue was over $32 billion. Sprint is controlled by SoftBank Group Corp., a Japanese Corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

As required by the Tunney Act, the proposed consent decree, along with the Department’s competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days of its publication to Scott Scheele, Chief, Telecommunications and Broadband Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Suite 7000, Washington, D.C. 20530. At the conclusion of the 60-day comment period, the court may enter the final judgment upon a finding that it serves the public interest."

UNIVERSITY PARK, Ill. — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has hit a private water provider with notice of several violations after high lead levels were detected in several south suburbs. Aqua Illinois first notified its customers in University Park, Green Garden and Monee Township about high lead levels on June 14. Nearly six weeks later, 1,500 households remain under a “do not consume” advisory.

Aqua Illinois officials have blamed the spike in lead levels to a change in the chemicals it uses to treat the water. The Illinois EPA now says the company failed to obtain the necessary permits to make those changes, a violation of IEPA rules.

State regulators also fault Aqua Illinois for failing to properly monitor and report water quality test results last year.

""Your supply did not collect the required number of sample results from a certified laboratory,” the IEPA violation notice reads. All required lead and copper samples were not collected for the July-December 2018 monitoring period in University Park, according to the IEPA.

Aqua Illinois denies any alleged violations contributed to the lead problem or the difficulty in solving it. “We don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park,” the company wrote in a statement.

University Park mayor Joseph Roudez has previously criticized the private water provider for not providing the community with water quality reports prior to June.

Aqua Illinois revealed Friday that it has suspended four members of its management and professional team while the company examined the details of the IEPA’s findings.

University Park officials say they were led to believe the problem would be resolved within several days, a claim Aqua Illinois disputes. The water crisis in these south suburban communities is now in its second month.

“It could take several months before this is resolved,” Aqua Illinois president Craig Blanchette told WGN’s Joe Donlon.

In the most recent community update posted July 22, Aqua Illinois officials said “water lead test results in University Park have fluctuated, both increasing an decreasing in some areas. It’s not unusual to see this fluctuation, particularly in the first few months of treatment.”

“We acknowledge that while we all would have hoped to see treatment showing progress, it hasn’t had enough time yet,” reads a statement on Aqua Illinois’ website for residents effected by the water problems.

Aqua Illinois officials insist older homes impacted by the high lead levels will see their numbers subside when residents let water run for 2-3 minutes first thing in the morning. They’ve provided residents with filters and bottled water.

Blanchette provided WGN with the following statement:

""Aqua Illinois is committed to operating with complete transparency with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We have been working closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators since we issued the voluntary do not consume advisory June 14, and immediately launched an internal investigation. To date, we have identified the likely cause of elevated lead levels in a limited number of homes is due to water chemistry interacting with lead solder in the internal plumbing of homes built prior to 1990. (Lead solder was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1986). As part of our commitment to resolve this situation, we have engaged nationally renowned experts in this field to complement our team’s efforts. Related Story

Hundreds attend emergency meeting on water lead levels in south suburbs Aqua Illinois leadership makes every effort to comply with all federal and state regulations. We recently learned that IEPA has issued several regulatory violations relating to permitting and sampling. Although we continue working to gather the necessary information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what took place, it is important to note we don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park. We want our customers to know that we take these actions very seriously and are actively working with the IEPA on a resolution. Among the matters raised by the IEPA are permitting actions that took place in 2018. Aqua Illinois has since addressed these issues. During the process to change sources from well water to the Kankakee River, we installed a water main and changed treatment locations prior to receiving an IEPA permit. Though the changes were made prior to receiving the permits, the IEPA ultimately did issue the permits. The delay in applying for the permits, though it was eventually approved by the IEPA in 2018, was an oversight on our part. To correct this process, effective immediately, we have updated internal permit management practices to strengthen oversight of our permitting activities. The other issues raised by the IEPA involve the method of selecting sampling locations during the second half of 2018. Based upon our own investigation, we learned, and proactively advised the IEPA, that several homes selected for compliance sampling did not meet the proper criteria due to the age of the homes. We have addressed this issue, adding about 40 pre-1986 sampling locations to the existing sample set, thanks to the cooperation of our customers. This ensures that our lead testing correctly represents the various property types, ages, and plumbing construction in the community. As part of our holistic examination of the matter, Aqua has been and will continue to evaluate changes to processes and personnel to ensure we correct this situation and continue to improve our service for our customers and communities. As part of this process, Aqua has taken immediate action by suspending four members of the Aqua Illinois management and professional team while we thoroughly examine all the details around the IEPA’s findings. As a company, we collectively work each day with integrity, respect and in the pursuit of excellence in all we do, and we are accountable when we fall short of those values. The safety of our system is our top priority. We will continue to work with regulators, our own team and national water experts to restore and maintain safe drinking water for our customers."""
"Amazon has 'destroyed the retail industry' in the US, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says (AMZN)",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Finanzen.Net Gmbh'],,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/mnuchin-comments-on-amazon-says-theyve-destroyed-us-retail-industry-2019-7,"Reuters

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday that Amazon had ""destroyed"" the US retail industry.

The comments followed the Justice Department's Tuesday announcement that it had begun an investigation into whether ""market-leading online platforms"" harmfully weaken competition.

It's believed the investigation will focus on Amazon, Google, and Facebook, among other tech companies.

Watch Amazon trade live here.

US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin criticized Amazon on Wednesday, saying during a CNBC interview that the e-commerce giant had ""destroyed"" America's retail industry.

""If you look at Amazon, although there are certain benefits to it, they've destroyed the retail industry across the United States, so there's no question they've limited competition,"" Mnuchin said.

The comments followed the Justice Department's announcement on Tuesday that it had launched an investigation into whether a handful of ""market-leading online platforms"" unlawfully dominate their respective sectors. It's widely believed the companies under investigation include Amazon, Facebook, and Google's parent, Alphabet.

""There's areas where they've really hurt small businesses, so I don't think this is a one-size-fits-all,"" Mnuchin said of Amazon. ""And I don't have an opinion going in other than I think it's absolutely right that the attorney general is looking into these issues, and I look forward to listening to his recommendations to the president.""

The investigation is separate from potential antitrust inquiries involving tech giants including Apple, Google, and Facebook.

The nation's tech conglomerates are under attack from not only the Trump administration, but a potential successor. Several Democratic presidential candidates have said that such companies have harmful monopolies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first to release a detailed plan for how she would split up large tech companies to boost competition.

Amazon's stock was down roughly 0.3% as of 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Shares are up about 33% year-to-date.

Trump rightly threatens tariffs on France,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-rightly-threatens-tariffs-on-france,"Whether Chablis, Sancerre, or Pomerol, French wine is better than American wine.

But President Trump is right to threaten tariffs over a French tax on U.S. technology companies. Trump explained his position on Twitter.

France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly. I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2019

Don't get me wrong, I support free trade. But free trade must flow both ways. In turn, the U.S. cannot sit idle when other nations take unfair advantage of American companies. And tariffs offer a rough but effective tool to force reconsideration of unfair actions.

Such is the case with France's technology tax.

That tax is extraordinarily unfair in its undue impact on U.S. technology firms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Protecting French technology firms by targeting higher-earning U.S. firms, France is punishing American firms for being better. It's an attack on the American economy in protectionist benefit of France's struggling socialist economy. France must know that it cannot act unfairly against America and expect us to simply sit back and smile.

Hopefully President Emmanuel Macron will reconsider his tax. France is a close U.S. ally, and both our nations have a vested interest in expanded trade and cooperation. But trade must be fair and free. Whether abroad or at home, U.S. technology firms are a crown jewel of our economy. As in this case, they deserve protection."
Déjà vu: Mueller again causes confusion on his reason for not charging Trump,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deja-vu-mueller-again-causes-confusion-on-his-reason-for-not-charging-trump,"Robert Mueller caused confusion during his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee as he appeared to contradict Attorney General William Barr, as well as declined to stand by a previous official statement from his own special counsel’s office, related to the decision-making behind not charging President Trump with any crimes.

Mueller’s report did not reach a determination on obstruction of justice in his 448-page report, although he laid out 10 possible instances of obstruction. Mueller’s report referenced a longtime Office of Legal Counsel opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but his report did not explicitly claim that that was the only reason Trump wasn’t charged in the investigation. Moreover, Barr said in April that Mueller told him that Mueller was not saying that he would have charged Trump with a crime but for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and, in addition, a joint statement from the offices of Mueller and Barr in May reiterated that point.

But Wednesday, Mueller appeared to reverse course, appearing to say that he would have charged Trump with a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California asked, “I’d like to ask you the reason, again, you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?”

“That is correct,” Mueller said.

Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona pressed him on this, saying “that is not what you said in the report and that is not what you told Attorney General Barr.” Lesko also pointed to the joint statement he put out earlier this year, saying there was no daylight between himself and Barr on that issue. She quoted from that statement, reading, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice.”

“So, Mr. Mueller, do you stand by your joint statement that you issued on May 29th as you sit here today?” Lesko asked.

Mueller declined to stand by the official statement from his own office from less than two months ago.

“I would have to look at it more closely before I said I agree with it,” Mueller said.

“My conclusion is that what you told Mr. Lieu really contradicts what you said in the report and what you said apparently repeatedly to Attorney General Barr,” Lesko replied. “And then you issued a joint statement on May 29.”

Lesko was referencing a nearly identical controversy which took place following Mueller’s press conference in late May. “The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,"" Mueller said at that time. ""The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation.""

After Mueller's roughly nine-minute statement, politicians, pundits, and journalists interpreted Mueller’s remarks as a clear break from what Barr stated, suggesting that Mueller was saying that the only reason he didn’t charge Trump was the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

But Barr said in April that he and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Mueller in early March and that they “specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion.”

“And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position,” Barr said in April. “He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime.”

Barr and Rosenstein concluded that obstruction had not occurred.

After the May press conference, the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel put on a united front that was intended to end speculation that Mueller contradicted Barr on the decision-making on whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice during his public address.

“The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements,"" a joint statement from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec and Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said at the time.

Before the joint statement came out, Mueller's office released a handout comparing his assertions about obstruction of justice to what Barr said about it. The document, which apparently sought to provide context, contained quotes from Barr's press conference before the release of Mueller's report in which he said Mueller repeatedly assured him that he did not think they would have found a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced bill to block death penalty after DOJ reinstates capital punishment,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/politics/pressley-abolish-death-penalty-bill/index.html,"(CNN) Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduced a bill Thursday that would abolish the death penalty after the Justice Department ordered federal capital punishment to be reinstated for the first time in nearly two decades.

The proposed legislation would ""prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any violation of Federal law, and for other purposes,"" according to an image of the bill that Pressley shared on Twitter.

Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, brought the bill to the House on the same day that Attorney General William Barr directed the Justice Department to resume using the death penalty and the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the execution of five inmates after adopting an updated execution protocol.

After 16 years without an execution, Barr on Thursday ordered the executions of "" five death-row inmates convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly"" in December and January, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.

The move represents a dramatic reversal after more than a decade-long hiatus in the federal use of capital punishment, as President Donald Trump has taken on the issue and called to ""bring back the death penalty."" The death penalty is legal in 29 states and the federal government, though there have been no federal executions since 2003 and the number of people facing state executions has been on the decline.

But that contradicts a notice to appear in immigration court served to Galicia in which the Department of Homeland Security accused him of falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen while in custody.

Galicia is a Dallas-born U.S. citizen who lives in Edinburg in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. He also says he has dual citizenship in Mexico. The story of his 26 days in detention after being picked up by the Border Patrol in Falfurrias garnered widespread national attention after The Dallas Morning News first reported it on Monday.

At a House Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Brian Hastings, Chief of Law Enforcement at the U.S. Border Patrol, also said that Galicia was detained because it was discovered he had used a U.S. visitors visa that his mother got for him when he was a minor to travel back and forth from Mexico more than 50 times.

During the oversight hearing on family separations and short-term custody, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, asked Hastings why Galicia was held in custody for more than three weeks.

Galicia was released less than 24 hours after The News broke the story."

Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454805-interior-whistleblowers-say-agency-has-sidelined-scientists-under,"Former Interior Department employees who say they experienced retaliation at the agency for their work on scientific endeavors appeared before lawmakers Thursday, sparking political wrangling over the role of scientists in the Trump administration.

Republicans used the appearances to accuse Democrats of political theater, while Democrats in turn stepped up calls for scientists to be protected.

Among those testifying were Joel Clement, a whistleblower who said he was removed from his work on climate change and reassigned to an accounting role.

Also testifying was Maria Caffrey, who said she had to fight with the Interior Department to keep references to the human contributions to climate change in a report on how sea level rise would impact national parks.

Clement said under the Trump administration, the Interior Department “has sidelined scientists and experts, flattened the morale of the career staff, and by all accounts, is bent on hollowing out the Agency.”

Clement, now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said he was removed from his work with 30 Alaska Native communities that were “one big storm away from being wiped right off the map” and needed to be immediately relocated.

Caffrey, whose research was funded by the Interior Department, said she found herself repeatedly demoted at the agency after pushing to keep references to the human impacts of climate change in her report.

“It removes the meaning from my study. I prepared four different climate scenarios for those three different time periods, so those scenarios hang on how much greenhouse gases we produce in the future,” she said, including how much humans contribute to the atmosphere.

“I had become at outcast for standing up,” she added, noting the department told her they didn’t want her help even on a volunteer basis. She is now looking for work in the Denver area.

The hearing was to discuss the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Democrats seek help in appealing to conservatives on climate | Whistleblowers say Interior sidelined scientists | Automakers strike fuel efficiency deal with California in rebuff to Trump Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California MORE (D-N.Y.) that would add protections for government scientists, including allowing them to publish research outside of government channels and establish a Scientific Integrity Officer.

Several Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee complained the hearing was political theater centered around a bill that would have to pass out of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.

They said there were more complaints about misuse of science under the Obama administration.

“In listening to some of our panelists today you would think that the Trump administration was the only one where there have been issues regarding scientific integrity, and that certainly is not the case,” said Rep. Jody Hice Jody Brownlow HiceInterior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess The 27 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block Trump from taking military action against Iran MORE (R-Ga.).

Tonko said such instances should only strengthen their interest in joining their bill.

“If you believe in science and scientific integrity we should have learned from that past and not look for a reason not to do this,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that ""it’s no secret that the Trump administration is not a fan of science.”

“There are the stories that career scientists at Interior are too afraid to share. And with good reason. They have seen their colleagues, like our witnesses, get threatened, harassed, reassigned, and retaliated against,” he added.

Scientists have been vocal about what they view as mistreatment under the Trump administration.

They have cited examples, ranging from limiting government-funded scientists from sitting on an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) board to a proposal to limit what kind of studies can be considered by the EPA, to recent plans to relocate U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers and Bureau of Land Management policymakers.

“To purge the language of climate change from the agency entirely is a direct assault on the science we know is very prominent and very clear on the risk to the mission of the agency that we act now to protect real people in harm’s way,” Clement said.

Interior was invited to attend the hearing but did not send a representative.

""The Department of the Interior diligently works to accommodate Congressional invitations to testify,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill, saying it had participated in 59 of 62 Congressional legislative and oversight hearings that the Department has been invited to, or 95 percent, and provided over 65 witnesses for Committees."""
"DOJ's T-Mobile-Sprint Settlement Gets Claps, Slaps in D.C.",https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/dojs-t-mobile-sprint-settlement-gets-claps-slaps-in-d-c,"Industry players were ready with a torrent of reaction to the Justice Department's approval Friday (July 26)--with divestitures and conditions--of the T-Mobile-Sprint deal. It must still be voted by the FCC and faces a state legal challenge from various state attorneys general.

FCC chair Ajit Pai said the deal would help close the digital divide, for example, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said what looked like a bad deal before still looked like one.

“I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Justice has reached a settlement with T-Mobile and Sprint,"" said Pai, who had already signaled he could support the meld with the spin-off of pre-paid business Boost Mobile and other conditions. ""The commitments made to the FCC by T-Mobile and Sprint to deploy a 5G network that would cover 99% of the American people, along with the measures outlined in the Department’s consent decree, will advance U.S. leadership in 5G and protect competition. In addition, the transaction has garnered bipartisan support, including from Governor Laura Kelly (D-Kan.), Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-Calif), and former FCC commissioner Mignon Clyburn.

“Because of this transaction’s potential to help close the digital divide in rural America and maintain our nation’s leadership in 5G, as well as the commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint to the FCC, I plan to present my colleagues soon with a draft order, consistent with the Department’s filings, favorably resolving the FCC’s review of the transaction.”

“I am pleased that the Department of Justice is now prepared to approve the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, albeit with conditions and divestitures that, in the current competitive communications environment, are likely not necessary to protect consumers, and which, in fact, may have the effect of reducing some of the benefits from the merger,"" said Free State Foundation president Randolph May.

“That said, DOJ’s decision after a lengthy review finally to allow the merger to be consummated is welcome. As a general matter, and in this case involving the rapidly changing communications marketplace driven by technological innovations like 5G next-generation wireless networks, it takes longer than it should for the government to reach a decision. The gap in time between due deliberation and delay often is far too large. So, I hope the FCC will quickly approve the merger, and the state Attorneys General will now withdraw their lawsuit, which has had more than a whiff of politics driving it from the get-go.""

Five state AG's joined DOJ in the settlement that paves the way for the deal, but others signaled they are pushing ahead. If so, the deal can't close until that case is resolved, which won't be until at least late October at the earliest.

Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel had her doubts.

“Today the Department of Justice gave its blessing to the largest wireless merger in history,"" she said. ""I remain skeptical that this combination is good for consumers, good for competition, or good for the economy. Before the FCC votes on this new deal, the public should have the opportunity to weigh in and comment. Too much here has been done behind closed doors.”

Deal opponent and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said the deal looked no better in the light of the spinoffs and conditions.

“Competition is critical to a strong economy—among the four largest cell phone carriers, that competition has led to lower prices, better service, and more innovation. That’s why, when this merger was first reported, I raised serious antitrust concerns about combining two of the four remaining nationwide wireless carriers, and I have since urged the Justice Department to reject the deal as anticompetitive,"" she said. ""It looked like a bad deal then, and it looks like a bad deal today, despite the parties’ promises and this proposed consent decree.”

""Consummation of this revised transaction has more obstacles than many observers seem to recognize,"" said Benton Foundation's Andrew Schwartzman. ""For one thing, even though a majority of the FCC has signaled its approval, the Commission must still issue its decision. The expected dissents from the FCC minority will provide more ammunition for opponents. Second, the new consent decree must also be approved by a federal judge. While that review has often been automatic in the past, this time the states and other opponents have already marshaled a vast array of evidence against the deal.""

“It is clear that the Justice Department agrees with what we’ve said for the past year: the wireless market needs at least four viable competitors,"" said Joshua Stager, senior counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute. ""But the agency’s response is needlessly convoluted. DOJ does not need to bend over backwards to fix a bad merger. It can simply block the deal.""

“Makan Delrahim and the Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division have upheld the competition and consumer welfare standard,"" said INCOMPAS CEO Chip Pickering. ""The DOJ agreement is great news for wireless customers, smaller providers, and fiber builders. This settlement preserves a market structure of four national carriers, unleashes a true race to new 5G, and will help rural broadband grow.

“The DOJ deal is both creative and competitive,"" he said. ""[C]onsumers get greater portability and flexibility to switch providers. By empowering Dish, the DOJ preserves a fourth national provider that will benefit consumers and open up more wholesale opportunities for smaller wireless builders. Dish is a disrupter with a long history of providing service to underserved rural Americans and is well positioned to bring more competition to more communities. Makan is to be commended and congratulated for his commitment to the law and competition.""

“Just a few months ago, reports indicated that the expert antitrust staff at the DOJ recommended the agency sue to block the T-Mobile-Sprint merger,"" said Common Cause special advisor and former FCC Chairman Michael Copps. ""But rather than take the reported advice of career staff, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim decided to approve a blatantly anticompetitive deal by bringing in Dish as a sham fourth competitor. Basic math tells you that replacing Sprint, a national carrier with 50 million subscribers, with Dish, a satellite company with zero wireless subscribers, is a recipe for competitive disaster. In addition, Dish has no wireless infrastructure of its own and has been sitting on spectrum for years without any clear plan to build a network. No type of network sharing arrangement with T-Mobile will lower wireless prices or actually force Dish to build out its own network.""

“Today’s decision reduces the number of nationwide mobile carriers from four to three, with the hope of one day creating a new fourth competitor,” said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). “Unfortunately, the best way to ensure competition would have been for the Justice Department to simply block the merger so we would still have four competitors today. Instead, they chose a more complicated and uncertain path. I plan to closely monitor this deal because we must ensure consumers have at least four choices, not three, in the wireless marketplace.”"
Ethics Probes Launched at Department of the Interior and EPA,https://undark.org,"['Jane Roberts', 'Frankie Schembri', 'Ek Silbergeld', 'Big Wayne', 'Seeker Of Truth', 'Even When Ugly', 'Peter George']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://undark.org/2019/07/26/ethics-probe-interior-department-epa-july-2019/,"Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visits oil rig manufacturer Watson Hopper Inc. in Hobbs, New Mexico. Visual: Tami A. Heilemann/U.S. Department of the Interior

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients.

• An unprecedented and lethal heatwave swept across Europe this week, breaking records in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom. As of Friday morning, French authorities reported at least five deaths linked to the rising temperatures. There, temperatures topped 108 degrees Fahrenheit; in Germany, 106.7 degrees; Belgium 105 degrees; and in the Netherlands, 104 degrees. The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing. If successful, LightSail 2 will be the first steerable solar sail to orbit Earth. With silvery sails roughly the size of a boxing ring, it may, at times, be visible from Earth with the naked eye, according to the Planetary Society. (Gizmodo)"
"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."

'A f---ing travesty': Justice Department veterans say the way Mueller's testimony was handled blew past the 'historical significance of this moment',https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-veterans-react-mueller-congress-testimony-2019-7,"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 US election in a ""sweeping and systematic"" fashion to propel Donald Trump to the presidency. The Trump campaign welcomed the intrusion. Trump and his associates tried to weaponize their political positions for financial gain. After assuming office, Trump significantly obstructed the investigation into Russia's meddling on nearly a dozen occasions. He ordered the White House counsel to fire the man investigating him. He urged witnesses not to cooperate with prosecutors. And contrary to his repeated assertions, he was not ""totally and completely exonerated"" of wrongdoing.

The former special counsel Robert Mueller testified to these findings before Congress this week, but none of it was actually news.

Nearly everything the former FBI director told lawmakers was plucked directly from the 448-page report that the Justice Department released in April. At a news conference the next month when he formally closed the investigation, Mueller told reporters that if he were forced to testify before Congress, he would not go beyond what was contained in the document, because ""the report is my testimony.""

So it surprised — and frustrated — Justice Department veterans when politicians and pundits were disappointed that Mueller's six-hour testimony this week wasn't more theatrical.

Mueller 'behaved like a dignified man who didn't want to be turned into some sort of performing monkey'

""Anybody who was disappointed by Mueller's performance simply wasn't paying attention,"" Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who has worked with members of Mueller's team, told INSIDER.

Elie Honig, a former prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, told INSIDER that ""the debate people are having right now is about style rather than substance.""

""Let's take away the superficiality of whether he looked assured, or whether he hesitated, or looked too old, or if he fired off his answers quickly enough,"" he said. ""Why should that matter? Look at what he said.""

Cotter also contrasted Mueller's report with that of Ken Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.

The Whitewater investigation started as a probe of President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton's real-estate investments. But the matter quickly ballooned to include explicit details of the president's personal life and his affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.

The Starr report ""was a perversion of what a prosecutor should do, and it went for the lurid details instead of staying within its scope, and it was blatantly partisan,"" Cotter said.

""Mueller's report was the opposite,"" he added. ""It is a model of clarity. It's well written. It's well organized. He hit the main points over and over again. There are summaries and previews. It's all there. He behaved like a dignified man who didn't want to be turned into some sort of performing monkey.""

'One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team's work'

When he could, Mueller stuck with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, or he directed lawmakers to read the report themselves. He demurred when asked to read aloud portions of the document, and he flatly refused to discuss topics that strayed from his mandate or were currently involved in investigations.

""As a prosecutor, he had to ensure he stayed detached from the political process, presenting his findings in a manner that did not make it appear he was choosing a side or advancing an agenda,"" Renato Mariotti, another longtime former federal prosecutor, wrote for Politico Magazine. ""One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team's work.""

Mariotti added that even though Mueller's monotone answers may not have made for dramatic TV, ""they weren't without effect.""

At one point, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, walked Mueller through a particularly incriminating line of questioning in which he got Mueller to confirm, with one- or two-word answers, that Russia wanted to help Trump win in 2016, that Trump and his campaign encouraged the effort, and that Trump lied to the public about his financial dealings in Russia.

In another instance, Democratic Rep. Val Demings got Mueller to confirm that the president was ""generally"" untruthful in his written answers to prosecutors' questions.

Elsewhere, Mueller said that welcoming foreign assistance in an election is ""unpatriotic"" and ""wrong,"" and that ""'problematic' would be an understatement"" regarding Trump's effusive praise of WikiLeaks.

Among other things, he also revealed that some members of Trump's inner circle are still subjects of counterintelligence investigations.

'It was a f---ing travesty'

Given the substance of Mueller's testimony, former officials expressed frustration with the media's coverage of the hearings.

""Everything we saw in the aftermath was about Mueller asking for questions to be repeated, how it played for the Democrats, how it looked for Republicans, whether this was good or bad for the president,"" a former senior Justice Department official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director told INSIDER. ""And very little was about the value of what Mueller said and what's in his report. It was a f---ing travesty.""

Cotter echoed that view.

""What should have been a very serious, very important inquiry into an attack on our democracy — from outside and from within, reaching to the very highest levels of our government — was treated as a TV show, and it was reviewed as though Mueller was an actor in a play,"" he said.

""The criticism that everyone has is that Mueller refuses to reduce his report to a sound bite,"" Cotter added. ""He won't lie. He won't pervert. He won't take something complex and present it as simple. And with all this circus over who won and who lost and how Mueller performed, we've blown past the historical significance of this moment."""
"EPA: Deal between Calif., 4 automakers to reduce emissions, improve mileage a ‘PR stunt’",https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/07/epa-deal-between-calif-4-automakers-to-reduce-emissions-improve-mileage-a-pr-stunt.html,"A spokesperson with the Environmental Protection Agency is calling a deal between California and four automakers to increase gas mileage and emissions standards a “PR stunt.”

Michael Abboud made the comments to the Associated Press after the deal was announced Thursday, July 25. This comes as the Trump administration reportedly moves on plans to set a single federal standard for fuel economy ratings and greenhouse gas emissions.

A.P. reports California made a deal with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 percent year-over-year from 2022 to 2026 model years. There are “at least” a dozen other states that follow the state’s rules when it comes to these standards.

The Trump administration has bounced around the idea of freezing the standards for each in 2021. Those in favor of this freeze believe it will stop new car prices from rising due to the cost of fuel-saving technology.

Judd Deere, an EPA spokesperson, told the news organization that the Trump administration plans to move forward in taking the state’s rights away when it comes to setting the standard. He told A.P. that the federal government, not a single state should set the standards.

I applaud these four auto companies for reaching an agreement that is good for our workers, manufacturers, and suppliers. This agreement will help reduce carbon emissions, promote innovation, and benefit consumers.https://t.co/CfcjFLtKwb — Sen. Debbie Stabenow (@SenStabenow) July 25, 2019

“Few issues are more pressing than climate change, a global threat that endangers our lives and livelihoods,” Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. ""California, a coalition of states, and these automakers are leading the way on smart policies that make the air cleaner and safer for us all.

“I now call on the rest of the auto industry to join us, and for the Trump administration to adopt this pragmatic compromise instead of pursuing its regressive rule change. It’s the right thing for our economy, our people and our planet.”

A.P. reports that the involved automakers view this deal as an insurance policy to provide some certainty no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election. The news organization quotes a person who requested not to be identified due to the negotiations not being made public.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group that represents a dozen automakers, said in a statement that the announced deal is “not attainable and needs to be adjusted”

This is just more proof that no matter how hard the Trump Administration tries to pull us backward, we'll keep moving forward. https://t.co/bR3Zi040xd — Rep. Mike Levin (@RepMikeLevin) July 25, 2019

“Uncertainty from protracted litigation is a major concern for an industry with long production cycles, so much capital investment and 10 million Americans dependent on auto paychecks,” the group writes in the statement. ""Individual companies may have different perspectives on how best to achieve greater certainty.

“A final federal rule regarding future CAFE/GHG standards has yet to be released and automakers continue to seek an optimal pathway forward that meets the diverse needs of our customers while providing environmental improvements, preserving safety and auto jobs and keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans.”"
DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"
Supreme Court clears way for Trump to use Defense Dept. funds for border wall,https://fox59.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://fox59.com/2019/07/26/supreme-court-clears-way-for-trump-to-use-defense-dept-funds-for-border-wall/,"WASHINGTON D.C. (CNN) — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct parts of a wall along the southwestern border that the government argues is necessary to protect national security.

The decision allows the Defense Department money to be spent now while a court battle plays out over whether the government had the authority to divert funds that were not appropriated for the wall. The Supreme Court voted 5-4, along ideological lines, to allow the funds to be used while the court appeals proceed.

In a brief order, the court said that it was ruling in favor of the Trump administration before the litigation has played out because the government had made a “sufficient showing” that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.

Three members of the liberal wing of the court — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — wrote they would have blocked the funds for now. The fourth member, Justice Stephen Breyer, wrote separately to say that he would have allowed the government to use the funds to finalize the terms for contractors but block the funds from being used for the actual construction.

The Supreme Court’s order is a significant win for Trump, who is likely to use the construction of a wall as a major talking point on the campaign trail. The President celebrated the decision in a tweet Friday evening.

“The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed,” the President tweeted. “Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!”

The decision overrules a lower court decision that had blocked the transfer of funds while appeals played out. A panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to allow the use of the funds earlier in the month, holding that the challengers were likely to prevail in their case because the use of the funds “violates the constitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.”

The order comes after Trump ended a 35-day government shutdown in February when Congress gave him $1.4 billion in wall funding, far less than he had sought. He subsequently declared a national emergency to get money from other government accounts to construct sections of the wall.

The $2.5 billion had been shifted from various programs including personnel and recruiting, Minuteman III and air launch cruise missiles, E-3 aircraft upgrades and the Afghan security forces training fund. The Pentagon said it was able to move that money due to uncovered cost savings as part of a process known as “reprogramming.” The money was moved into a Defense Department counter-drug account that is authorized to spend money on the construction of border barriers.

Many lawmakers slammed the decision to move the money away from those national security priorities, threatening to strip the Pentagon of its ability to move money around, something the Defense Department has acknowledged would be detrimental.

Lawyers for the government had asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis and unblock the use of the funds while legal challenges proceed in the lower courts.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco noted in court papers that the projects needed to start because the funds at issue “will no longer remain available for obligation after the fiscal year ends on September 30, 2019.” He said that the funds are necessary to permit the construction of more than 100 miles of fencing in areas the government has identified as “drug-smuggling corridors” where it has seized “thousands of pounds of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine” in recent years.

“Respondents’ interests in hiking, birdwatching, and fishing in designated drug-smuggling corridors do not outweigh the harm to the public from halting the government’s efforts to construct barriers to stanch the flow of illegal narcotics across the southern border,” Francisco argued in the papers, regarding the challenge from environmental groups.

It is a loss for critics, including the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition that argued the administration had illegally transferred the funds after Congress denied requests for more money to construct the wall. The groups argued the wall — in areas in Arizona, California and New Mexico — would harm the environment.

The ACLU, representing the groups, argued in court papers against a stay of the lower court ruling fearful of the wall’s impact on border communities.

“Issuance of a stay that would permit Defendants to immediately spend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with the tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public interest,”ACLU lawyers told the court.

The ACLU slammed the decision after it was released Friday evening.

“This is not over. We will be asking the federal appeals court to expedite the ongoing appeals proceeding to halt the irreversible and imminent damage from Trump’s border wall. Border communities, the environment, and our Constitution’s separation of powers will be permanently harmed should Trump get away with pillaging military funds for a xenophobic border wall Congress denied,” said Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project."
