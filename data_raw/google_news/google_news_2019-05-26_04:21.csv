Federal judge who blocked Trump's border wall donated $20K to Obama,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/federal-judge-who-blocked-trumps-border-wall-donated-20k-to-obama,"A federal judge who partially blocked President Trump’s plans to build a border wall along the United States-Mexico border previously donated almost $30,000 to former President Obama, other Democrats, and a political action committee.

U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam, an Obama appointee confirmed in 2014, donated $6,900 to Barack Obama’s debut campaign for president and $14,500 to his reelection campaign, according to federal election records. The same records also indicate he contributed $4,500 to the Democratic National Committee in 2012 and, between 2012 and 2015, sent $3,100 to the Covington Burling LLP PAC, which supports candidates from both parties. His contributions totaled $29,000.

Gilliam made the donations, first reported by the Epoch Times, prior to serving as a U.S. District judge. He had said during his confirmation hearing that he “would base my decisions solely on the facts of each case and the applicable precedent, without regard to any political ideology or motivation,” and that “any personal views would not interfere in any way with my ability to neutrally apply the law.”

Gilliam is one of three federal judges who have donated to Democratic candidates in the past and recently ruled against the Trump administration.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos and U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, both Obama appointees, ruled to release Trump’s financial documents demanded by Democratic subpoenas as investigations into President Trump continue in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the Mueller report stated that while it “does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” and Democrats have insisted the report provides a basis for further investigations into the Trump campaign.

Ramos, who ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capital One can provide House Democrats with Trump’s financial records, donated $4,025 to Obama’s 2008 campaign for president, and also contributed $1,000 his then rival, Hillary Clinton. He made further donations to other Democrats, such as Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., and Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., who serve on the House Financial Services and Intelligence committees. Ramos does not appear to have made political donations since being appointed to the federal court in 2011.

Mehta, who ruled against blocking a congressional committee’s subpoena of Mazars USA, Trump’s accounting firm, also donated $1,000 to Obama’s first campaign and doubled his donation for the former president’s reelection bid. Mehta also appeared to stop political donations after his 2014 federal appointment."

While speaking at a Harris County Democratic Party event in Houston Friday, she said: “The president and his cronies have been running around spreading a doctored video of Nancy Pelosi.”

“Now, it is sexist trash, but it is also a sign that Trump is running scared,” she continued. “So if you believe in the rule of law and the responsibility we all have to hold our leaders accountable, then we cannot relent on this front either.”

Clinton’s fiery comments were made the day after Trump tweeted a segment from Fox Business along with the quote, “PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE.”

The clip shows House Speaker Pelosi appearing to slur her words while speaking, at least in part, about immigration.

The release of this video and another one of Pelosi that appears to have been manipulated come as Trump and the House Speaker battle over calls for impeachment and continuing investigations.

Trump’s Targeting of Intelligence Agencies Gains a Harder Edge,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael S. Schmidt', 'Julian E. Barnes']",05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies.html,"Mr. Barr has not made his motivation clear. But in three months as attorney general, he has aligned himself with the president’s dim view of the inquiry. He declined to knock down the notion that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt, described investigative efforts into the Trump campaign as “spying” and begun the multiagency review into the roots of the investigation. Mr. Barr decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice, a decision that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, declined to make.

Mr. Barr served as a driving force in securing the power to declassify government secrets, and the lead-up to Thursday’s announcement demonstrated an amount of planning that went beyond previous similar forays by Mr. Trump and his aides. In July, when they announced that they planned to take away the security clearance of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, they had not done the homework to discover he no longer had one.

Mr. Barr asked for the White House to grant him additional, far-reaching powers for his review, according to two administration officials. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, who was an assistant to Mr. Barr during his first stint as attorney general under President George Bush in the early 1990s, oversaw the effort to grant Mr. Barr’s request, the officials said.

And though the White House was ready last week to release the memo outlining his new powers, Mr. Barr asked for the White House to wait until he had taken care of outstanding business, including telling the heads of all the relevant intelligence agencies about the coming change.

When the White House released the memo on Thursday evening, it landed with authority and a presentation that signaled a concerted effort unlike Mr. Trump’s tweets or stream-of-consciousness comments to reporters. The document was written in legalese and issued as a memorandum on White House letterhead.

For Democrats, Mr. Barr’s newfound powers served as a sign that Mr. Trump had found a new, and potentially effective, tool in his war on the so-called deep state.

“This is a president who will lash out and destroy anything if he believes it will suit his interests,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “And he now has a capable lieutenant in the attorney general to help him do just that.”"

President Donald Trump on Sunday took time out on his state visit to Japan to re-affirm his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and rail against a U.S. judge for partially blocking his border-wall funding plan.

""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,"" Trump wrote in a tweet posted before 6 a.m. local time.

Story Continued Below

Trump's tweets came hours before he met with close ally Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his four-day trip to Japan to discuss North Korean engagement, ongoing trade negotiations and to meet with Japan's newest emperor Naruhito.

North Korea launched several suspected short-range missiles earlier this month, which Trump has dismissed as ""very standard"" following a series of personal negotiations with the authoritarian leader.

Japan relies heavily on American forces to defend itself, and has repeatedly raised concerns over North Korea’s missile tests, saying they are a violation of U.N. resolutions. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, this week echoed that position.

On Saturday, Trump arrived aboard Air Force One at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo before meeting with Japanese business executives, where he talked about the strong relationship between the two countries and the future of trade relations.

""Japan has had a substantial advantage for many, many years, but that's OK, maybe that's why you like us so much,"" Trump said, adding that in the future it will be ""a little bit more fair, I think.""

Trade negotiations between the two countries have been a major factor in the U.S.-Japan relationship after Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership early in his presidency. Last week, Trump delayed auto tariffs for six months while the administration pursues trade deals with Europe and Japan.

Later Sunday, Trump met with Abe in Chiba, where they played golf and will attend a sumo wrestling championship, before going to dinner with the prime minister and his wife, Akie.

On Monday, Trump will meet with Emperor Naruhito, the first foreign leader to do so since he assumed the throne.

Earlier Sunday, at 4:35 a.m. local time, Trump lambasted a Friday ruling by Calif.-based U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam halting a $1 billion transfer from Pentagon counterdrug moneys aimed at funding parts of border-wall construction and maintenance in Texas and Arizona.

“Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!” Trump wrote.

About a half hour later in a barrage of tweets and re-tweets, Trump thanked actor Jon Voight, re-tweeted Fox News host Jesse Watters and railed against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett for committing what Trump claims is a hate crime.

Smollett was accused of staging an attack in Chicago where two men wearing MAGA hats yelled homophobic and racist remarks, but his case was dismissed by the Cook County state’s attorney’s office.

In his later North Korea tweet, Trump also said he ""smiled when [Kim] called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?""

North Korea has labeled Biden, the former vice president and Democratic candidate for president in 2020, a “fool of low IQ” and an “imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being” after he called Kim a tyrant during a recent speech, according to the Associated Press. Trump fixed the spelling of Biden's name in a later tweet.

Trump has held two summits with Kim in Singapore and Hanoi, Vietnam. Trump tweeted in April that a third summit “would be good” while writing glowingly of their relationship. North Korea this week said it would not be open to further talks until the U.S. changes its position on nuclear disarmament."

"Intelligence community to provide ""appropriate"" information to DOJ for Russia review",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intelligence-community-to-provide-appropriate-information-to-doj-russia-review-barr-declassification/,"President Trump's decision to empower Attorney General William Barr with sweeping declassification authorities has seeded a simmering conflict between the Department of Justice and the intelligence community that centers on the president's long-held objections to investigations launched into links between his 2016 campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump on Thursday granted Barr ""full and complete authority"" to declassify government secrets and instructed the intelligence community to ""quickly and fully"" cooperate with Barr's review of the investigation into Russia's 2016 interference.

In doing so, the president is allowing Barr to declassify information of which other agencies — including the CIA, FBI and NSA — are the custodians, and whose public release would typically be determined by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

In a carefully-worded statement released Friday, DNI Dan Coats seemed to assert some of his own jurisdiction by indicating the intelligence community would provide the Department of Justice with all ""appropriate"" information related to its review, while implying excessive, inappropriate or politically-motivated demands would meet with pushback.

""I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,"" Coats said.

""The [intelligence community] will continue to faithfully execute its mission of providing timely, apolitical intelligence to the president and policymakers,"" he said.

For almost as long as he has been in office, the president has maintained that his campaign was improperly surveilled. With encouragement from supporters in congress and conservative media, he has inched closer to publishing classified materials he believes will prove his assertions.

Critics of the president warn that Barr could use his power to selectively release information that, devoid of context, supports the president's case while damaging some of Mr. Trump's self-identified nemeses — individuals Trump believes were politically motivated to derail his campaign.

Those opposed to the move say they see in it echoes of the attorney general's handling of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's findings — which Barr at first distilled into a mostly favorable, abbreviated summary before releasing the far more damaging but still redacted full report itself.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the attorney general had ""already shown that he has no problem selectively releasing information in order to mislead the American people.""

""People risk their lives to gather the intelligence material that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are so eager to politicize,"" the Democrat, who represents Virginia, said.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Mr. Trump's move an ""abuse of power"" whose underlying intention was to ""weaponize and politicize the nation's intelligence and law enforcement entities."" He said the committee would conduct ""vigorous oversight"" of any steps to ""selectively reveal and distort classified information.""

But allies of the president, including Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California have previously urged Mr. Trump to take the steps he has now deputized Barr to take. Nunes is the former chairman and now ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. He has claimed the roughly 20 classified pages of a surveillance warrant application for former Trump campaign associate Carter Page could undermine the FBI's work and suggest an abuse of procedure.

In September the president indicated in a pair of tweets that he was close to declassifying a number of items related to the Russia probe, but after a meeting with the Justice department and calls from unspecified ""key allies"" declined to move forward. He told Fox News in an interview at the time, ""I want to wait until after the election.""

During remarks to reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump explicitly named countries he suggested had played a role in triggering or fueling the investigation.

""I hope [Barr] looks at the [United Kingdom] and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country,"" Mr. Trump said.

Both the United Kingdom and Australia are part of the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing group that also includes the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Mueller's report confirmed that the FBI's inquiry was triggered by an Australian diplomat's tip that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos knew before it was public that Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The two met in 2016 in London, where CIA director Gina Haspel was station chief at the time.

Former national security officials said the public disclosure of intelligence contributions made by allies could damage those strategic relationships.

""It is yet another step that will raise questions among our allies and partners about whether to share sensitive intelligence with us,"" said CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, who served as the CIA's deputy director and is now the host of Intelligence Matters.

He added that the president's move overall had led to a further ""destruction of norms that weakens our intelligence community.""

""It's very unusual — unprecedented in my experience — for a non-intelligence community officer to be given absolute declassification authority over the intelligence community,"" said David Kris, who led the DOJ's national security division and now heads the Culper Partners consulting firm.

""This extraordinary assignment and the reaction it has provoked show how far we have moved from historical norms,"" he said."
47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

DeVos has not responded publicly to the letter, and officials for the Education Department were not immediately available to respond to NPR's request for comment.

In a statement to Reuters, the department said it recognized the sacrifices veterans make for their country and said it wanted to avoid ""unintended consequences"" that might result from automatic loan cancellation. The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."

Potential Clash Over Secrets Looms Between Justice Dept. and C.I.A.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julian E. Barnes', 'David E. Sanger']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/trump-barr-declassify-intelligence.html,"The intelligence agencies already have a degree of unease over the Justice Department’s ability to keep the identity of sources secret. The name of the F.B.I. informant involved in the initial investigation of the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia was inadvertently made public.

“If you compromise agents, lives can be lost. That is why this is so sensitive,” Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview. “It is important to be exceedingly careful in this area. That is my only concern, and I hope Mr. Barr realizes that.”

Mr. Barr asked Mr. Trump for the declassification authority, a Justice Department official said on Thursday. He has not detailed the information he is seeking, but some officials have said he is interested in how the C.I.A. concluded Mr. Putin ordered the interference campaign in 2016.

The most prominent of the C.I.A.’s sources of intelligence on Russia’s election interference was a person close to Mr. Putin who provided information about his involvement, former officials have said. The source turned over evidence for one of the last major intelligence conclusions that President Barack Obama made public before leaving office: that Mr. Putin himself was behind the Russia hack.

Long nurtured by the C.I.A., the source rose to a position that enabled the informant to provide key information in 2016 about the Russian leadership’s role in the interference campaign, the officials said.

John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director under Mr. Obama, would bring reports from the source directly to the White House, keeping them out of the president’s daily intelligence briefing for fear that the briefing document was too widely disseminated, according to the officials. Instead, he would place them in an envelope for Mr. Obama and a tiny circle of aides to read.

But Mr. Trump’s promise to declassify a broad swath of documents suggests that Mr. Barr’s mandate is more extensive than investigating any single source. Mr. Trump’s comments mentioning Britain and Australia appeared to be a reference to the F.B.I.’s investigation of George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."

Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, if student borrowers die or become permanently disabled, they are eligible to have their loans forgiven, so a successful granting of TPD status would allow for the complete discharge of student loans.

The attorneys general argued that automatically canceling the student debt would benefit veterans whose severe disabilities might prevent them from filling out the necessary forms.

Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told Politico that “while ‘automatic discharge’ may seem like a simple solution, there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged.”

Hill also cited ""potential state and local tax liabilities"" that could burden veterans after their loans were forgiven and veterans' potential inability to take out other student loans in the future if their current ones were forgiven.

Anticipating this criticism, the attorneys general wrote that ""we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill,"" though they considered adding a way to opt out of the automatic loan forgiveness.

According to a FOIA request filed by Veterans Advocacy Succes, an advocacy group, with the Department of Education, more than 42,000 veterans are eligible for TPD status, but fewer than 9,000 people had applied as of the beginning of May 2018, More than 25,000 eligible veterans were in default.

"Corey Lewandowski predicts criminal referrals for former FBI officials including Comey, McCabe",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/24/corey-lewandowski-predicts-criminal-referrals-for-/,"Corey Lewandowski, President Trump’s former campaign manager, anticipates criminal proceedings being initiated soon against several former FBI officials, he revealed Thursday.

Appearing on Fox Business, Mr. Lewandowski predicted that James Comey, Andrew McCabe and other former FBI officials will face criminal referrals after Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice’s inspector general, finishes an investigation into potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.

The FBI obtained warrants under FISA to monitor the communications of former Trump associates as part of a counterintelligence investigation into Russian election interference, which the president has regularly categorized as illegal “spying” authorized by the previous administration against his campaign.

Speaking to host Gregg Jarrett, Mr. Lewandowski said he expected the watchdog’s review will result in charges being recommended against several former FBI officials involved in the Russia probe, including Mr. Comey, the former director of the FBI, and Mr. McCabe, the bureau’s former deputy director, as well as former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who had both worked on the investigation prior to being caught exchanging disparaging text messages about Mr. Trump.

“I think what we’re going to see, Gregg, is in March or April of next year, James Comey, Andy McCabe, Strzok and Page will be on trial for the crimes they committed against the Fourth Amendment and against this president,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “But we can’t wait.”

The FBI began investigating members of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign during the 2016 race to identify potential ties to the Russian government, which the U.S. intelligence community has accused of interfering in the election in an attempt to help Mr. Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

The probe was launched by the FBI under the leadership of Mr. Comey, who Mr. Trump fired in May 2017. The Justice Department subsequently appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel tasked with resuming the Russia probe, and that investigation ultimately resulted in criminal charges against 34 people, including several former members of Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Mr. McCabe was fired from the FBI in March 2018, hours ahead of his scheduled retirement. Ms. Page left the special counsel’s team in July 2017, and Mr. Strzok was removed from the Russia probe over the text messages prior to eventually being fired in August.

Mr. Barr said last month that he expected the inspector general’s report to be completed by May or June.

Five takeaways from Barr's new powers in 'spying' probe,https://thehill.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/445515-five-takeaways-from-barrs-new-powers-in-spying-probe,"President Trump Donald John TrumpA better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans Pelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Trump arrives in Japan to kick off 4-day state visit MORE this week gave Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrPelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Five takeaways from Barr's new powers in 'spying' probe Trump declassification move unnerves Democrats MORE new authorities to examine and possibly release classified material related to the Justice Department’s inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.

The move is widely perceived as an effort by Trump to ramp up his administration’s probe of surveillance directed at members of his 2016 campaign. The president and his allies have suggested that federal agents biased against him improperly initiated the investigation into Russia's election interference.

Barr said last month he would examine the “genesis and conduct” of the Russia probe, adding that he believed the Trump campaign was “spied” on and wanted to ensure it was “adequately predicated.” Those remarks drew fire from Democrats, who accused him of advancing a conspiracy theory.

Here are five things you need to know about Trump’s new direction.

Sweeping powers for Barr

Barr was also given the authority to unilaterally declassify materials related to the investigation, allowing him to “direct” intelligence officials to declassify them. Such documents usually go through an interagency process to determine what can be declassified and released publicly, and the agency where the intelligence originated has to sign off on the final declassification.

The White House memo sent to intelligence agencies on Thursday said Barr should, “to the extent he deems it practicable,” consult with intelligence officials before declassifying certain materials.

The move affords Barr considerable new powers to view and potentially release highly classified material gathered by the FBI and CIA in the course of the Russia investigation.

“As far as I know, it is unprecedented for the president to delegate his authority to declassify to somebody who is not the original classifier,” said Steven Cash, an ex-CIA officer and former chief counsel to Sen.

“He’s now in the chain of command with respect to classification between the president and Coats or Haspel or whoever’s information it is,” added Cash, who is now an attorney specializing in national security law at the law firm Day Pitney.

Trump’s move also reflects the growing trust he has in Barr, who has earned praise from the president as a result of his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump orders more troops to Mideast amid Iran tensions Trump: Democrats just want Mueller to testify for a 'do-over' Graham: Mueller investigation a 'political rectal exam' MORE’s report and decision to open up an inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.

The new declassification powers are limited to materials related to Barr’s inquiry into the Russia probe. The memo released Thursday states that the powers will terminate when Barr leaves his post and will not extend to the next attorney general.

Potential for conflict with intelligence community

Trump is no stranger to conflict with U.S. intelligence agencies, and former officials say his latest move could put the intelligence chiefs in a difficult position.

While it’s not unusual for the intelligence community to cooperate with law enforcement investigations, some former officials say it will become problematic if Trump is seen as using the agencies to go after his political enemies.

John Sipher, a retired member of the CIA’s clandestine service, said it could create problems for Haspel and others if the president looks to “scapegoat” officials who collected intelligence that formed the basis for the Russia investigation.

“Hopefully, Barr and people in the national security structure of Justice go about this in a standard way. They can get the information they need,” Sipher said. “If he himself is trying to get specific information to be used by the president for political purposes, then he’s really being irresponsible.”

Some also say that even the threat of declassifying materials could chill existing intelligence sources and make it difficult to cultivate new ones going forward. Foreign partners may also be wary of sending intelligence to the U.S. if they think it could ultimately be made public.

It is unclear to what extent the intelligence agencies were consulted before Thursday’s announcement.

Coats said in a statement Friday afternoon he would provide Barr with the “appropriate information” in his review. He also expressed confidence the attorney general would work with the intelligence community “in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk.”

An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a CIA spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Barr’s use of the term “spying” has already put him at odds with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who told lawmakers during testimony earlier this month that he wouldn’t use that term to describe lawful FBI investigations. Wray also said he had no evidence “personally” that FBI agents illegally surveilled the Trump campaign.

At the same time, Wray described Barr’s review as appropriate and said he had been in “fairly close contact” with the attorney general to assist him.

Democratic fury meets Republican praise

Democrats, already critical of Barr’s handling of Mueller’s findings, have accused Trump and the attorney general of attempting to politicize the nation’s intelligence apparatus. Some suggested the administration may be looking to selectively release classified material to shape a false narrative.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffFive takeaways from Barr's new powers in 'spying' probe Trump declassification move unnerves Democrats Trump appeals order siding with House Democrats bank subpoenas MORE (D-Calif.) described Trump’s order in a statement Friday as a ""corrupt escalation of the President's intention, with the assistance of the Attorney General, to weaponize and politicize the nation's intelligence and law enforcement entities.""

Schiff added that his committee will ""conduct vigorous oversight of any steps to selectively reveal and distort classified information, abuse the declassification process, and place at risk sources and methods, thereby weakening our safety and security.""

Trump’s Republican allies have long clamored for an investigation of the Russia probe, pointing to text messages exchanged by FBI agents criticizing Trump before the election.

Some have also scrutinized the FBI’s use of information from Christopher Steele — author of the unverified Trump-Russia dossier — in a warrant application to spy on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, alleging the bureau did not properly disclose the researcher’s Democratic link.

Trump’s calls to ‘investigate the investigators’ get louder

Thursday’s developments illustrate Trump’s calls to “investigate the investigators” — a message he has used to counter an onslaught of investigations from Democrats following the release of Mueller’s report.

On Friday, Trump denied he was seeking “payback” following Mueller’s two-year investigation, which did not result in conspiracy charges against members of his campaign but nevertheless ensnared some of his allies. Mueller’s final report contained embarrassing details about Trump’s attempts to seize control of the investigation but ultimately failed to reach a judgment on whether the president obstructed justice.

Trump described the Russia investigation as “an attempted coup or an attempted takedown of the President of the United States” in remarks to reporters on Friday.

“I don’t care about payback,” Trump said. “I think it's very important for our country to find out what happened.”

More shoes to drop

Trump’s recent move all but guarantees his administration will release certain materials from the early stages of the Russia investigation.

Trump has long said he would declassify and release sensitive documents, including the application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Page, a highly redacted version of which the Justice Department made public last summer under pressure from Republicans.

Trump told reporters on Friday he is leaving what to release up to Barr.

“I declassified, I guess, potentially, millions of pages of documents. I don’t know what it is. I have no idea. But I want to be transparent,” Trump said. “We have documents now that I have declassified for the purpose of the attorney general. He can then show them to the public, do whatever he wants to do with them.”

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"

Federal prosecutors filed a new 18-count indictment against Assange on Thursday, adding 17 counts to the single count that was unsealed in early April, alleging he unlawfully received and leaked information related to national defense.

Snowden reacted on Twitter. ""The Department of Justice just declared war—€ not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself. This is no longer about Julian Assange: This case will decide the future of media."" he said.

John Demers, DOJ’s assistant attorney general for national security, said “Julian Assange is no journalist"" and argued Assange was involved in “explicit solicitation of classified information,"" including leaks by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, called Assange's arrest in April ""a dark moment for press freedom.""

Snowden was charged by the Department of Justice on two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and one charge of stealing property of the U.S. federal government. The Russian government has granted him asylum status since 2013."
EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."
"A better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans",https://thehill.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/445286-a-better-va-with-mental-health-services-is-essential-for-americas,"In our nation’s history, more than 1 million American servicemembers have been killed in U.S. wars. For the past 151 years on the fourth Monday of May, we have honored the great soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who have fallen.

Much has changed, but the generations of brave men and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom have endured, and the sanctity with which we regard these individuals has remained.

There are many millions of veterans, however, who returned home from war to find a country unable to provide them access to basic human rights such as quality civilian employment opportunities, health care and education. In recent years alone, 20.4 million men and women risked their lives for their country and, in return, many were refused fundamental care by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). President Trump Donald John TrumpA better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans Pelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Trump arrives in Japan to kick off 4-day state visit MORE has renewed the fight for these veterans.

The VA fell into disarray under the Obama administration. President Obama tried to establish reform with initiatives such as the Veterans Choice Program to expand health care options and reduce wait time for medical appointments to a maximum of 30 days. This policy was great in theory, but in practice the Government Accountability Office found that some veterans waited up to 70 days for care and many died as a result.

Why was this happening? Some VA personnel neglected their duties by falsifying wait times for medical care and ignoring major systemic issues in the medical network with no accountability.

When President Trump took office in 2017, he pledged that the men and women who uphold our country’s freedoms no longer would be ignored by their government. In June 2017, he signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This legislation resulted in the removal, demotion or suspension of more than 4,000 employees who exhibited substandard performance. By weeding out the under-performers, veterans have been left with a better-functioning VA.

The Trump administration continues to move forward with efforts to expand VA accountability like the implementation of the “Access and Quality Tool,” a platform that allows veterans to view wait times and assess quality-of-care data when choosing health care providers. As a result, wait times have improved and are comparable to the private sector.

There is a prevalence of mental illness in the veteran community that was not effectively addressed under Obama. Thirty one percent of active duty and reserve military personnel who were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have experienced some form of mental illness or have reported experiencing a traumatic brain injury, but only 30 percent of those servicemembers will get treatment. The 70 percent who go untreated are forced to cope and, sadly, 22 veterans die by suicide every day in the United States, on average. Substance abuse precedes approximately 30 percent of all veteran suicides and about 20 percent of high-risk behavior deaths.

The stigma surrounding mental health treatment has created a substantial access gap in coverage, meaning many people who need to be receiving treatment may not be. In an effort to create more accessible options, President Trump secured $73.1 billion in funding for VA mental health services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention and rural veterans’ health initiatives.

Veterans’ choices and access to medical care have expanded with the VA Mission act, making it easier for veterans to find treatment in their own communities and providing access to walk-in clinics for immediate care.

The president also signed an executive order requiring Homeland Security, Defense and Veterans Affairs secretaries to construct a joint plan that affords veterans access to mental health treatment.

The transition from a uniformed life to a civilian one is not easy, but President Trump has worked to ensure that veterans have access to quality job opportunities. The jobless rate for all veterans fell to an 18-year low of 3.5 percent in 2018, from its peak at 9.9 percent in 2011.

President Obama once said, “Our nation owes a debt to its fallen heroes that we can never fully repay.” Although that is true, it is with gratitude that we honor the fallen heroes whose bravery and sacrifice has ensured our freedom. Not just this day but every day, we must choose to honor their memory by caring for those soldiers who did return home. As President Trump said, “We will not rest until all of America’s great veterans receive the care they’ve earned through their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.”

"Ex-FBI lawyer: Carter Page FISA application approved in 'unusual' way by McCabe, Yates, and Baker",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-fbi-lawyer-carter-page-fisa-application-approved-in-unusual-way-by-mccabe-yates-and-baker,"A former top lawyer for the FBI described to lawmakers the “unusual” way the surveillance request targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page was handled by top leadership at the Justice Department and FBI, according to a transcript released this week.

In front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on Aug. 31, 2018, former FBI Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson said she was normally responsible for signing off on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before they reached the desk of her superiors for approval. Anderson said the “linear path” those applications typically take was upended in October 2016, with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates signing off on the application before she did. Because of that unusual high-level involvement, she didn’t see the need to “second guess” the FISA application.

The Page FISA application was filed by the Justice Department and FBI with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016. A surveillance warrant was granted and three renewals were subsequently approved. The FISA application relied heavily on unverified research in British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, which was compiled through his employment with opposition research firm Fusion GPS with funding from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Anderson said all FISAs need to be signed off on in the FBI’s National Security Law Branch, where she was assigned at the time. Anderson said she was the Senior Executive Service approver for the “initiation” of the Page FISA, including determining whether there is legal sufficiency.

But Anderson stressed “in this particular case, I'm drawing a distinction because my boss and my boss’ boss had already reviewed and approved this application.” She emphasized “this one was handled a little bit differently in that sense, in that it received very high-level review and approvals — informal, oral approvals — before it ever came to me for signature.”

Anderson said that FISA approvals are typically “tracked in a linear fashion” and that someone in the Senior Executive Service “is the final approver on hard copy before a FISA goes to the director or deputy director for signature.” She said the Page FISA was approved outside regular procedures.

""Because there were very high-level discussions that occurred about the FISA,"" Anderson said she believed that meant “the FISA essentially had already been well-vetted all the way up through at least the Deputy Director [McCabe] level on our side and through the DAG [Yates] on the DOJ side.” Yates had already signed the application by the time it made it to Anderson’s desk.

The publicly available Page FISA documents show then-FBI Director James Comey also signed off on it.

Because the FISA application had already been approved at such high levels, Anderson said she did not look at the Page FISA application with much skepticism. “I wouldn't view it as my role to second-guess that substantive approval that had already been given by the Deputy Director [McCabe] and by the Deputy Attorney General [Yates] in this particular instance,"" she said.

Asked why this FISA application was different, Anderson said she believed “the sensitivity level of this particular FISA resulted in lots of very high-level attention both within the FBI and DOJ.”

“The General Counsel [Jim Baker] … personally reviewed and made edits to the FISA, for example,” Anderson said. “The Deputy Director was involved in reviewing the FISA line by line. The Deputy Attorney General over on the DOJ side of the street was similarly involved, as I understood, reviewing the FISA application line by line.”

Baker recently defended the FBI’s handling of the FISA process, saying “we took [the dossier] seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally” and did not treat it as “literally true in every respect.” Baker also said, “I am not going to go into details with respect to what investigative steps we actually took to try to validate it.” Former FBI Director James Comey still referred to the dossier as “salacious and unverified” even in 2017.

Anderson stressed that McCabe, Yates, and Baker all played key roles in reviewing the Page FISA. “My approval at that point was really purely administrative in nature. In other words, the substantive issues — the FISA had already substantively been approved by people much higher than me in the chain of command,"" Anderson said.

Anderson said it “typically would not have been the case” that people such as McCabe and Yates would sign off on a FISA application before she did.

""That part of it was unusual, and so I didn't consider my review at that point in the process to be substantive in nature,"" Anderson said. ""In other words, there were smart lawyers, high-level people on both sides of the street who had reviewed and signed off on the application, the details of the application. And so I was simply signaling, yes, this package is ready to go forward.""

Anderson said the seal of approval from such high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials meant that her signature on the FISA application was mostly perfunctory.

Anderson cast doubt on whether Comey would usually read a full FISA application, considering he could receive more than a dozen in a given day. “And so, yes, the director or deputy director, if he signs the FISA, you know, relies on others,” Anderson said.

Even in normal circumstances, Anderson said she likely would not read the full FISA application before signing off on it “unless there were an issue that was identified by the cover note,"" due to time constraints.

Anderson admitted she did not read the Page FISA the day that she signed off on it but noted she’d read it at some earlier point in time.

The FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks, and there are at least three federal investigations into alleged FISA abuse and other matters related to the way the FBI and DOJ conducted the Trump-Russia investigation."

Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture,https://www.politico.com,"['Catherine Boudreau', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Liz Crampton']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/trump-farmer-bailout-trade-usda-1459840,"Many farmers are still contemplating what to produce this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the trade package, such as soybeans. | Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images agriculture Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture

President Donald Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget.

Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years.

Story Continued Below

Trump tweeted about the new bailout for farmers earlier this month, soon after he decided to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China and Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, many of them agricultural. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.

Farm groups are headed to the White House on Thursday afternoon to join Trump as he announces a $16 billion boost for agriculture. The American Farm Bureau Federation and groups representing soybean, corn, wheat and pork producers are expected to attend, as well as lawmakers including Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who has worked closely with the administration on the aid package.

“We want to make sure that the farmers are being protected as we go through the process of negotiating new trade deals,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday outside the White House.

But the Trump administration’s decision to roll out the program now is drawing critics.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting.

“[W]e want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government’s doing,” he said.

“The timing couldn’t have been worse,” said Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Illinois, and a former head of the USDA Farm Service Agency during the Obama administration.

Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans, Coppess said.

""There is certainly enough experience at USDA to know that announcing payments during planting might well cause more problems,"" Coppess said.

USDA’s first trade aid package sent the bulk of direct payments to soybeans given the significant damage that China’s 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports has done to prices and demand. China, the world’s top pork producer, is expected to need fewer soybeans to feed its hogs this year because African swine fever has forced the government to kill more than a million animals.

This year, the amount of money farmers receive will largely depend on the county in which they live in, instead of what they grow, the USDA announced on Thursday.

USDA officials estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes and will multiply that by what was planted in the area this year.

“We wanted to make sure producers are planting for the market,” Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, told reporters Thursday.

The 2018 trade package was based on what crops farmers actually planted that season — bucking Congress' efforts over the years to make subsidy programs more market-oriented by tying them to farmers' average historical acres and yields.

The aid programs in both years primarily involve sending direct payments to farmers and ranchers using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution under the USDA that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy.

But it is unclear whether the CCC has enough borrowing authority to fund another tariff-relief program. It is only allowed to borrow $30 billion per fiscal year from the U.S. Treasury to fund its work, and last year’s bailout used a big chunk of that. The CCC also is used to fund traditional farm subsidies authorized every five years by Congress.

Lawmakers last September included language in a short-term spending bill that effectively gave the CCC more flexibility to keep money flowing.

Hoeven, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subpanel overseeing USDA, told reporters last week that Congress can easily reimburse the financial institution if needed.

Trump is using taxpayer money to help just one industry harmed by trade policy. Other industries reeling from the tariff battles, from car manufacturers to shoe retailers, are not expected to receive financial aid.

Some farmers recognize the disparity, and stress that they would prefer to have open access to markets.

""We prefer that over a check from the government,"" said Mark Watne, president of the North Dakota Farmers Union. ""But right now, our own government is making our demand go down. We can't control that.""

A Justice Department investigation into Major League Baseball’s operations in Latin America and the trafficking of Cuban players has expanded in recent months, with former league and team officials among those contacted by FBI agents and called to testify before a grand jury, according to people with knowledge of the probe. The wide-ranging inquiry is, in part, seeking to root out suspected involvement of MLB team officials with smugglers who force Cuban players to sign away exorbitant portions of their earnings in exchange for passage off the island.

While MLB officials have blamed the plight of Cuban players on the U.S. embargo on the island nation, some scouts, agents and former federal prosecutors argue that major league rules — which make it more lucrative for Cuban players to defect to other countries first rather than come straight to the United States — fuel corruption across Latin America, and that MLB has long ignored its role in this black market.

“It’s always been clear that these guys are basically hostages, until the time that they sign major league contracts and give a sizeable portion of their contracts to the criminals involved in smuggling them out,” said Joe Kehoskie, a former player agent. “Everyone stuck their heads in the sand.”

The Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres have received subpoenas seeking records relating to scouting and signing of players from Latin America, and the Washington Nationals voluntarily turned over documents to federal agents, including emails and financial records. Those who have testified to a federal grand jury in D.C. or have spoken to federal agents, according to people with knowledge of the investigation, include a former MLB official, a former Dodgers front office staffer, a former Dodgers player from Cuba, two veteran scouts who worked for the Dodgers and Braves, a sports agent who has represented Cuban players, and three employees of a player development camp in the Dominican Republic.

Among baseball’s scouting community, rumors have circulated for years of certain teams or scouts with connections on the ground in Cuba, or inside smuggling organizations, providing an illicit advantage. This is at least the third major federal investigation focused on the trafficking of Cuban players in recent years and, to this point, none has yielded criminal charges against anyone employed by an MLB team. But the current probe, reports of which first surfaced last fall, demonstrates the Justice Department’s sustained interest in whether MLB officials and team employees are aware of, or involved in, illegal activities.

A review of documents in an earlier prosecution and interviews with more than a dozen people who have spoken with federal investigators offer insight into the government’s specific interests. People with knowledge of the investigation say it is being overseen by prosecutors at the Justice Department’s D.C. headquarters who specialize in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, signifying interest in whether MLB team employees have been involved in bribing foreign government officials. Agents in the Los Angeles and Miami offices are contributing to the investigation, and are pursuing possible crimes including human trafficking, money laundering and visa fraud, according to people with knowledge of the probe, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.

In a statement, the Dodgers said the club has “cooperated fully with the government’s inquiry and will continue to do so.” The Braves, Padres and Nationals all declined to comment, as did the Justice Department.

[Velocity is strangling baseball — and its grip keeps tightening]

Since the early 2000s, amid a surge of Cuban baseball players fleeing the island, stories have circulated of their harrowing journeys to freedom. Cuban players and their families have been kidnapped, held at gunpoint, threatened with torture, falsely jailed by corrupt police officers, and have endured other traumas at the hands of smugglers demanding money.

This latest investigation dates from at least early 2017, when Nick Francona — a former front-office staffer with the Dodgers and Mets and son of Cleveland Indians Manager Terry Francona — said he gave hundreds of pages of internal records from his time with the Dodgers to an FBI agent. The records, reviewed by The Washington Post, show Francona and his colleagues suspected some of the team’s scouts conspired with “buscones” — often ruthless street agents in Latin America who represent young players — to steal some of the club’s money intended for players.

The current probe follows a sprawling federal investigation based out of Miami that resulted in the 2017 conviction of Cuban sports agent Bart Hernandez and an alleged accomplice for crimes relating to the smuggling of players. That trial offered evidence that provided an unprecedented window into the corruption surrounding Cuban players, with witnesses describing bribery and fraud schemes involving immigration officials in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

In interviews with The Post, two retired federal prosecutors who oversaw previous investigations accused MLB of ignoring obvious signs of the corruption they believe the league’s rules incite across Latin America. Under rules collectively bargained between the league and the MLB Players Association, a Cuban who defects to the United States has to enter the MLB draft, where salaries are suppressed, while a Cuban who defects elsewhere is declared a free agent and can sign with the highest bidder.

“MLB’s own rules and regulations . . . encourage the smuggler and fraudsters to go through the charade,” said Patrick Sullivan, a retired former assistant U.S. Attorney who oversaw the 2017 prosecution of Hernandez and trainer Julio Estrada.

“There’s a lot of willful ignorance going on. It’s obvious American baseball knew what was going on . . . It really is a stupid rule,” said Ben Daniel, a retired former assistant U.S. Attorney who led the 2007 prosecution of former agent Gus Dominguez.

Dan Halem, MLB deputy commissioner and the league’s chief legal officer, said this criticism is misguided.

“The reason that Cuban players are being smuggled out of Cuba is because they can’t voluntarily leave,” Halem said.

U.S.-Cuba relations, after moving toward normalization under the Obama administration, have soured under the Trump administration, which recently scuttled a deal MLB negotiated with the Cuban Baseball Federation intended to reduce trafficking of players.

In 2014, MLB tried to change the rule criticized by former federal prosecutors, Halem said, but the union refused to agree to new terms. The MLBPA declined an interview request or to answer any questions for this story.



‘All of these players received visas from the U.S. consulates either in Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Mexico,’ MLB chief legal officer Dan Halem said. ‘And, if anyone, consular officials are experts in determining whether residency acquired in the countries in which the consulates are operating are legitimate or not. Right?’ (Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press)

A risky path

Before the early 2000s, federal law enforcement largely ignored crimes occurring in connection with how Cuban baseball players made their way to America. The embargo was intended to punish Fidel Castro, a baseball fan who took it as a personal affront when his country’s best players defected, so targeting the people who helped Cuban players get here made little sense, as a matter of U.S. policy.

That changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, as federal law enforcement cracked down on illegal immigration. Around this same time, violent drug gangs in Latin America, attracted by a flood of MLB money, became increasingly involved in smuggling Cubans.

Inspired by the path taken by Jose Contreras — a Cuban pitcher who defected not to the United States, but to Nicaragua, and then signed a $32 million contract with the Yankees — these criminal organizations worked with boatmen, or “lancheros,” who plucked players off the island and routed them through countries where they could quickly buy residency with bribes, and then declare free agency.

Among baseball scouts and agents, the suddenly routine occurrence of Cuban players successfully navigating, in a matter of a few weeks, the normally years-long path to residency in other countries raised questions about whether MLB teams were essentially subsidizing organized crime in Latin America. Veteran Cuban outfielder Yasiel Puig’s 2012 defection, according to published reports by ESPN and Los Angeles Magazine, was overseen by smugglers connected to Los Zetas, the Mexican criminal syndicate, who bribed immigration officials to get Puig residency in Mexico within 15 days of his arrival.

In the mid-2000s, federal law enforcement agencies started taking intense interest in the smuggling of Cuban players. Under code names Operation Boys of Summer, Operation Safety Squeeze and Operation Sisyphus, agents with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security worked a series of investigations aimed, in part, at determining whether MLB team employees were doing business with human smugglers.

A window into the world

In 2016, one of those investigations led to the indictments of Bart Hernandez, a Cuban native and sports agent based in Florida, and Julio Estrada, a trainer of Cuban players. Their trial introduced evidence showing the rampant fraud around Cubans entering the major leagues, and raised questions about whether team and league officials ignored obvious red flags noticed years later by federal agents.

In Mexico, according to courtroom testimony, Hernandez partnered with gangsters nicknamed “Nacho” and “Tony Montana.” One player’s wife testified that, when her husband absconded for a few days, Montana called her and said that if her husband didn’t return, they would send him back to her in a box, “chopped in pieces.”

A Mexican woman who acted as an accomplice for Hernandez testified that she and her associates bribed Mexican immigration officials with amounts in the range of $6,000 per player for residency papers that included fraudulent home addresses and fabricated places of employment. Hernandez and his accomplices later routed their players through the Dominican Republic, until a mix-up involving Yoenis Cespedes, the slugging outfielder whose nickname in Cuba had been “La Potencia,” meaning “The Power.”

According to the testimony of Ed Dominguez, a former MLB employee in the league’s investigations office, after Cespedes arrived in the Dominican Republic in 2011, his agent mistakenly attempted to bribe the wrong Dominican immigration official. The immigration official who was supposed to receive a bribe, out of anger, reported Cespedes’s agent to Dominican law enforcement, according to Dominguez, and the ensuing investigation caused problems for months for all Cuban players trying to get residency in the Dominican Republic.

As a result, according to testimony of his alleged accomplices, Hernandez started taking his Cuban players across the border to Haiti. There, according to the testimony of one alleged accomplice, players were greeted by Amin LaTouf, a “fixer” who helped players get residency by giving them fake jobs at a supermarket he owned and then working with contacts in the Haitian government. (LaTouf, who was indicted along with Hernandez and Estrada, evaded extradition from Haiti and remains a fugitive.)

Hernandez, who was sentenced to nearly four years in prison, is appealing his conviction. His attorneys declined to comment.

The Hernandez trial also produced evidence and testimony that could be interpreted as showing officials with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees involved in schemes to get Cubans to the United States.

One of the prosecution’s key witnesses was Eliezer Lazo Jr., the son and business partner of the former ringleader of a human smuggling organization who worked with Hernandez. Lazo Jr. — when asked about Leonys Martin, a Cuban outfielder who signed with the Rangers in 2011 — testified that his father had told him, after talking to Hernandez, that Rangers officials had approved of a plan to arrange for the player to enter the United States illegally by crossing at the Mexico border.

“The Texas Rangers reject any suggestion of inappropriate conduct,” attorney Gregory Saikin, the club’s outside counsel, wrote in a statement, “and give no credibility to self-serving and uncorroborated hearsay by an admitted human trafficker, relaying what his convicted felon father allegedly told him that another convicted felon said that ‘the team’ said.”

A document introduced as evidence also cited the Yankees as encouraging a Cuban player to defect, a potential violation of the U.S. embargo. The State Department document summarized an August 2012 interview in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, between a U.S. consulate official and a Cuban pitcher, Omar Luis, who had fled his native country a few months before.

“Was directly recruited from Cuba by the Yankees,” the State Department official wrote. When asked about how he got residency in Haiti, the report said the player replied, “The Yankees contacted a Haitian functionary who make it all happen.”

The Yankees declined to comment. Luis, who is out of baseball and lives in Miami, did not respond to a request to comment.

In an interview, Sullivan, the prosecutor who oversaw the case, wondered why MLB failed to take action on the signs of the fraud these Cuban players and their smugglers were committing in other countries. The residency documents these players quickly obtained in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti — some listing jobs such as jet ski operator, mechanic, and apartment complex supervisor — all flowed through the league office, Sullivan noted, each time Hernandez asked MLB officials to declare a new client of his a free agent.

“To us, it appeared sort of obvious,” Sullivan said.

MLB has for years conducted lengthy, extensive age and identity investigations of free agents in Latin America, sometimes resorting to DNA tests. But Halem, MLB’s legal officer, said investigating the residency documents Cuban players obtain in other countries is not under the league’s purview.

Halem said it is the State Department’s job to vet Cuban players applying for work visas, and pointed out State officials approved the applications of many of the players who, according to courtroom testimony, fraudulently obtained residency via Hernandez and associates.

“All of these players received visas from the U.S. consulates either in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Mexico,” Halem said, “and, if anyone, consular officials are experts in determining whether residency acquired in the countries in which the consulates are operating are legitimate or not. Right?”

In a statement, the State Department declined to address the instances of fraud unearthed in the Hernandez trial, and said it “takes all allegations of fraud seriously.”

Who knew what

A few weeks after the Hernandez trial ended, an FBI agent in Los Angeles received a LinkedIn message from Nick Francona, who believes he reignited federal law enforcement’s interest in the league’s dealings in Latin America.

A former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, Francona had a turbulent career in baseball after he left the military, with brief stints in the front offices of the Dodgers and Mets. In 2016, after the Dodgers fired Francona, he accused the club of discriminating against him as a veteran, which the Dodgers denied. In 2017, Francona was fired by the Mets, he claimed, because he was publicly criticizing MLB for not detailing where it spent money raised through the sales of military-themed apparel. In a statement addressing Francona’s departure, the Mets did not disclose a reason.

The documents Francona turned over to the FBI include dozens of emails he and his Dodgers colleagues exchanged in 2014 and 2015, in the first months of new team president Andrew Friedman’s regime. In many of the emails, it is apparent that Francona and his colleagues suspected their scouts in Latin America were skimming from bonuses meant for players.

For several months, the emails show, Francona and others discussed a plan to dismiss these scouts. They didn’t rush the process, Francona said in a recent interview, partly out of concern the departures would interfere with a series of pending signings.

Francona acknowledged he neither witnessed any Dodgers officials committing any crimes, nor did he have any direct evidence of any crimes.

While several Dodgers front office employees were involved in the exchanges, the records don’t indicate if Dodgers GM Friedman was aware of the suspicions. The Dodgers did not conduct an internal investigation of the scouts, the records show, nor did the club alert the league office or law enforcement. In the summer of 2015, the Dodgers parted ways with the scouts, by releasing them from their contracts or failing to renew their contracts.

“The suggestion that the team should have notified law enforcement, or MLB, or any other team, about rumors and unsubstantiated suspicions regarding any former employee is simply wrong,” Dodgers outside counsel David Schindler said in a statement.

Among the documents Francona provided the FBI was a series of emails discussing Hector Olivera, then a well-regarded 29-year-old infielder from Cuba the Dodgers signed in 2015, and harassment he was receiving from the smugglers who helped him defect. Olivera, who declined to comment, has testified to the grand jury in D.C., according to two people with knowledge of the investigation.

In a June 2015 email, a Dodgers interpreter updated Francona and others on Olivera’s progress assimilating into life in America.

“Olivera seems more comfortable both on and off the field,” the interpreter wrote. “Based on telephone conversations I’ve overheard, he has been able to make all his payments to the people who helped him defect from Cuba. He still has one more payment to go, but he seems relieved and is receiving fewer calls from people harassing him for money they are owed.”

According to people with knowledge of the investigation, federal authorities are interested in whether Dodgers scouts in Latin America engaged in illicit business dealings with the smugglers who brought Olivera from Cuba to Haiti, where he obtained residency in 2015. Before he signed with the Dodgers, Olivera was also the subject of a recruiting battle between two agents that resulted in a grievance filed with the players’ union that, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation, produced documents federal authorities are examining.

Olivera was ultimately a bust. The Dodgers traded him to the Braves in 2015, and after he was arrested for assaulting a woman in Arlington, Va., during a series against the Nationals — he was later convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail — the Braves traded him to the Padres, who released him in 2016.

While Olivera did play for the other two teams that have been subpoenaed as part of the investigation, federal authorities are interested in the Braves and Padres for other reasons, according to people who have been interviewed by FBI agents and prosecutors.

People familiar with the Braves organization say federal authorities have interest in the series of events that led to former general manager John Coppolella’s lifetime ban in 2017 for a raft of rules violations regarding the signing of international players.

Coppolella declined an interview request through his lawyer, Jacksonville criminal defense attorney Hank Coxe.

The precise nature of federal authorities’ interest in the Padres is also unclear. San Diego General Manager A.J. Preller has been punished twice by MLB — once for violating international signing rules with the Rangers, and in 2016 he was suspended for sending incomplete medical records for Padres players to trade partners — and the Padres have also been punished as an organization for breaking international scouting rules, under Preller’s watch.

In interviews with The Post, current and former scouts portrayed Latin America as treacherous territory, where scouts are under intense pressure to sign prospects, and bribes and kickbacks between scouts and buscones are common, and viewed by some in the industry as a cost of doing business.

One scout who testified before the grand jury expressed fear that personnel at his level would end up taking the fall for the actions of top club executives.

John Meringolo, a New York-based federal criminal defense attorney who has consulted with lawyers involved with the investigation, said federal prosecutors clearly have ambitious goals.

“Based upon the scope and breadth of the investigation, I think some of the GMs and others should start retaining counsel,” Meringolo said."

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report's ""monitoring list,"" which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China's yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan's value.

""This change puts foreign exporters on notice that the Department of Commerce can countervail currency subsidies that harm U.S. industries,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

""Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,"" he said.

It was a step toward making good on a campaign promise by U.S. President Donald Trump to address unfair currency practices, Ross said.

With an eye toward the mammoth wind turbines coming online by the mid-2020s — GE announced plans in March 2018 to commercially deploy a 12-megawatt offshore turbine in 2021 — the Energy Department wants to nudge manufacturers to build generators that can more easily be hoisted atop hubs topping out more than 100 meters above the waterline.

Project teams led by ABB, WEG Electric Corporation, American Superconductor and General Electric Global Research, respectively, were each to receive up to $400,000 to design a wind turbine generator capable of scaling to a capacity of 10 megawatts or more. ABB subsequently confirmed to Greentech Media it will not pursue the research project it had planned under the DOE grant, but the other three remain active.

After an initial one-year conceptual design phase, DOE will select one of the projects to receive up to $6.4 million for the construction of a scaled prototype. The full research program is expected to last four years.

Next-gen direct drive generators

The teams involved in the DOE-funded research project are developing direct-drive technologies for their planned high-efficiency, lighter generators.

Direct-drive machines generate electricity without using a gearbox, resulting in avoided maintenance. “Having all of those moving parts makes the gearbox one of the highest-maintenance parts of a wind turbine,” noted the DOE in a recent blog post.

According to Aaron Barr, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, the current generation of direct-drive wind generators “has reached technical and commercial maturity,” accounting for 26 percent of the wind turbines installed on land and 50 percent installed at sea globally in 2018.

But direct-drive turbines come with their own tradeoffs. Current designs rely on permanent magnets that require expensive, heavy rare earth elements. This in turn increases the weight of direct drive generators relative to those used in geared wind turbines.

WEG Electric Corporation plans to develop a lightweight generator designed both to use less rare earth materials than conventional geared turbines and to be integrated into its existing platform. ABB had planned to develop a generator that uses a magnet cooling system for use in either geared or direct-drive turbines as large as 15 megawatts.

The other two project teams — American Superconductor and GE — are developing superconducting generators expected to greatly reduce the need for rare earth materials.

GE’s proposed ultra-light low-temperature superconducting generator relies on lessons learned from the company’s decades-long magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work. The goal is a solution customized for offshore wind turbines larger than 12 megawatts.

“Superconducting electric machines aren’t really anything new. What is new is some of the cryogenic technologies that have evolved over the years for MRI we can now bring to electric machines to make them practical,” David Torrey, GE’s team leader, told Greentech Media in an interview.

He added, “To the extent you can raise the magnetic field, you can produce more power with less heat, making your generator more efficient.”

Superconducting generators' path to market

According to WoodMac's Barr, superconducting generators have been researched for years but manufacturers have yet to develop a commercial prototype.

Wood Mackenzie estimates that the technology is at least a decade from commercialization, with deployment likely to come in next-generation 15-megawatt or larger offshore wind turbines.

“However, this will require an intensive R&D effort from OEMs, supply chain partners, and government-funded research,” Barr said.

That's the reasoning behind the Department of Energy’s push to jump-start R&D in this space.

Direct-drive and superconducting generators have the most market potential at sea, where the reduced size and weight of the next-generation generators envisaged by DOE are likely to have the greatest impact.

“Offshore turbines are expected to be 60 percent direct-drive by 2025,” said Barr.

DOE sees high-efficiency, lightweight generators as one way to reduce the weight and cost of towers and foundations for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore turbines.

“As we look to the future with floating offshore wind platforms to access wind resources where the water is too deep for conventional foundations, lightweighting while maintaining high efficiency becomes even more important,” wrote the DOE’s project team.

Just don’t expect the DOE-backed generator designs to take over the market in the near term.

“The design cycle for offshore turbines is very long, due to the massive scale of the technology, significant supply chain investment, and high risk that dictates extensive validation periods,” said Barr.

“The DOE-funded research is unlikely to be applied commercially on the next generation of offshore wind turbines until 2030 or later.”

However, GE’s Torrey was optimistic that earlier deployment might be possible.

“We consider the MRI technology to be quite mature right now. Barring any unforeseen surprises, I think we can certainly have something deployed well before 2030.”"
How Much Political Experience Does It Take to Be Elected President?,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Astor', 'Alicia Parlapiano']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/23/us/politics/presidential-experience.html,"Highest previous position 2020 candidates No. elected president Most recently elected Senator 7 2008 House member 2 1880 Governor 10 2000 Mayor 0 (never) No political or military experience 1 2016 Cabinet member 6 1928 Vice president 5 1988 General officer 4 1952 Notes: Does not include the nine vice presidents who assumed the presidency after the death or resignation of the previous president. While some rankings are self-explanatory — senator is a higher position than representative, and governor is higher than mayor — others are somewhat subjective. From highest to lowest, we ranked the positions as follows: vice president, cabinet member, governor or senator, House member, mayor. No tiebreakers were needed between governor and senator.

You’ve never seen a House member elected president. Neither have your parents — nor, in all likelihood, their parents. The last time it happened, there were 38 states and electricity was a novelty.

The year was 1880, the congressman James Garfield. The 14 decades since are littered with the failed campaigns of candidates who thought they could replicate his feat.

But that hasn’t stopped six current and former House members from trying this year, a full quarter of the Democratic field.

As for what Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, the most recent addition to the candidate throng, is trying to do: Well, no one has ever done it. Never in American history has a sitting mayor been elected president, or even received a major party’s nomination. But three — Mr. de Blasio; Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; and Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla. — are running now.

The 2016 Republican field, which was almost as big as the Democratic field is now, included no House members or mayors. Of the 17 candidates, nine were sitting or former governors, and five were sitting or former senators.

But, of course, all those governors and senators lost to Donald J. Trump, who had no political experience at all. Before Mr. Trump was elected, no one had ever become president without a background in government or the military. Now, it’s harder to say what the bar is — or whether voters care.

The highest previous position of each U.S. president, by date of first election 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Governor Bush, 2000 Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet House member Garfield, 1880 (never) Mayor *Does not include those who assumed the presidency after the death or resignation of the previous president.

As the chart above shows, a small number of offices have produced the vast majority of our presidents. A governorship is the most common steppingstone. This year, though, only three of the 23 Democratic candidates are or have been governors, and all of them are trailing in polls.

While the vice presidency might seem the most obvious launching pad for the presidency, only five people have done what Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to do now: get elected after completing his vice presidency. Fourteen presidents were previously vice presidents, but nine of them took over when a president died or resigned. (Four of those nine went on to win a full term.)

Cabinet secretaries were elected president much more often in the early days of the republic than they are now. Hillary Clinton came close in 2016. But of the six presidents whose highest previous office was in the cabinet, four were elected before 1850, and the most recent, Herbert Hoover, was elected almost 100 years ago.

Senators occupy an interesting space in modern presidential history: frequently nominated but rarely elected. Since 1960, Americans have elected only two senators — John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama — to the presidency, but five more received their party’s nomination. This year, however, seven are running for the Democratic nomination, and most of the front-runners are among them.

By the time you get down to the House, the history is paper-thin, and thinner still for rank-and-file members. Garfield, the last House member elected, was a committee chairman.

But the six 2020 candidates in this category have one thing going for them: They are not the least experienced in the pack.

Two of their competitors, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang, are following a path on which nobody but Mr. Trump has been successful: They are running for president with no political or military experience at all."
USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be cut from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow the slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict-of-interest among plant employees since they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said, given the increased role that plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minutes versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said that the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term, and can only be applied to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term inspector — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said work tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food and Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, plant workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die due to foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"
Ingraham exclusive: Homeland Security boss defends against family-separation accusations at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ingraham-exclusive-dhs-head-defends-against-family-separation-accusat-at-the-border,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security is disputing accusations that U.S. authorities are continuing to separate children from their families.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps.

DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."

Qualcomm found violating antitrust laws in Californian court,https://www.notebookcheck.net,[],,,,https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-found-violating-antitrust-laws-in-Californian-court.421396.0.html,"Californian U.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh ruled in favor of FTC, which charged Qualcomm with antitrust violations involving complete disregard of FRAND practices, forced use of proprietary modems over competing ones, and slowed adoption of competing telecommunications technologies. Qualcomm immediately appealed, but if the higher court decides another hearing is not necessary, companies like Samsung, MediaTek and Huawei could provide competitively priced alternatives.

Back in 2017, the United States Federal Trade Commission was charging Qualcomm with multiple antitrust violations such as refusal to follow FRAND practices on licensed patents, forcing OEMs to use its modems by increasing competing modem prices via royalties, and preventing the adoption of competing telecommunications technologies. Just recently U.S. District Court judge Lucy Koh from California ruled in favor of the FTC and outlined five remedies that Qualcomm needs to undertake, but the decision is not final and Qualcomm immediately appealed to a higher court.



Judge Koh came to the conclusion that “Qualcomm’s licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process.” If the ruling still stands after the appeal, Qualcomm will be required to respect the following five remedies:





QuWindows 10 reportedly up and running on a developer's OnePlus 6Talcomm must not condition the supply of modem chips on a customer’s patent license status and Qualcomm must negotiate or renegotiate license terms with customers in good faith under conditions free from the threat of lack of access to or discriminatory provision of modem chip supply or associated technical support or access to software.



Qualcomm must make exhaustive SEP licenses available to modem-chip suppliers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and to submit, as necessary, to arbitral or judicial dispute resolution to determine such terms.



Qualcomm may not enter express or de facto exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips.



Qualcomm may not interfere with the ability of any customer to communicate with a government agency about a potential law enforcement or regulatory matter.



In order to ensure Qualcomm’s compliance with the above remedies, the Court orders Qualcomm to submit to compliance and monitoring procedures for a period of seven years. Specifically, Qualcomm shall report to the FTC on an annual basis Qualcomm’s compliance with the above remedies ordered by the Court.



Qualcomm’s appeal will be handled by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court, and if it decides the case is worthy of a new hearing, the case could go on for a few more years. Judge Koh’s ruling was most likely swayed by the recent Apple / Qualcomm settlement that forced Intel to exit the 5G modem market. Limiting Qualcomm’s monopoly would open up the telecommunications market for more competitive prices from companies like Samsung, MediaTek and Huawei."

USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

Sprint shares jump as DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim remains open to potential T-Mobile deal,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Matthew J.

The Justice Department remains open to the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint despite reports that it was leaning toward rejection, sources told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, is still talking with the companies and may be trying to find a way to support a deal despite his staff's opposition, the sources said.

Discussions about possible remedies are ongoing. But what kind of remedies — beyond what the companies committed to as part of a deal with the Federal Communications Commission — remain unclear.

Shares of Sprint jumped 4.6% in Thursday's premarket following Sorkin's report. T-Mobile shares were up nearly 1%.

Earlier this week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, elevated to the top post by President Donald Trump in 2017, said he plans to recommend his agency approve the merger after the companies committed to not raising prices for three years.

It's possible, according to Sorkin's reporting, that the DOJ could push for more years on no price hikes, for example.

The Obama administration rebuffed earlier efforts by the companies to merge, as well as an attempted deal between AT&T and T-Mobile, on concerns that such deals would hurt competition in the wireless industry.

Trump’s EPA is ‘cooking the books’ to justify its attack on clean air rules,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-epa-is-cooking-the-books-to-justify-its-attack-on-clean-air-rules/,"Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to distort the way it measures the benefits of some of the agency’s most impactful policies, regulations that safeguard human health by limiting air pollution. The primary beneficiary of such distortion? The coal industry.

When the government evaluates the health and financial benefits of clean air, the calculation typically incorporates the number of lives saved and the scale of reduced health impacts thanks to reducing pollution — also known as “co-benefits.” Incorporating these factors into a cost-benefit analysis forms the very foundation upon which many environmental protections are based.

But now, experts warn the EPA is opening the door to industry challenges to these clean air rules by changing the way it evaluates the long-accepted science on the risk of particulate matter — microscopic particles polluting the air that are linked to increased heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The agency may also be laying the groundwork, experts say, for using these “biased and misleading” calculations in other policy contexts. That fear was stoked by a new EPA memo released this week, ushering in a formal process to change the way the agency calculates its cost-benefit analysis across a slew of issues, from water pollution to pesticides.

It is well-established that reducing air pollution saves lives — a fact backed up by numerous scientific studies and government reports. In fact, a 2017 report from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that out of all federal rules, the EPA’s had the “highest estimated benefits as well as the highest estimated costs.” The costs and benefits capture everything from the new equipment required by power plants to the co-benefits from Americans’ reduced exposure to pollution.

What’s more, regulations designed to improve air quality accounted for over 95% of the benefits from EPA rules. When it comes to fine particle pollution, OMB said the benefits of regulation “far exceed” the costs.

Nonetheless, the EPA is now arguing that the calculation used to determine the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations needs to be changed. The agency is exaggerating the costs of these rules while downplaying their ecological, climate, financial, and health benefits so that it can more easily defend its sweeping rollback of environmental protections — changes that are often in line with industry demands.

The EPA’s proposed revisions to this math would reduce the number of lives at risk from repealing the Clean Power Plan and drastically downgrade the projected benefits of retaining the Mercury and Air Toxics standards (MATS) regulating power plant pollution. By eliminating the use of co-benefits, these policy changes don’t look as bad.

“Both approaches are means by which unscrupulous agency officials can cook the cost-benefit books and distort the debate about the value of health and environmental protections,” James Pew, a staff attorney at EarthJustice, told ThinkProgress. “They’re a way to rationalize rolling back these protections, or not establishing them in the first place.”

On Tuesday, the EPA released a memo directing four agency offices to “rectify… inconsistencies” regarding the process for calculating risks and benefits. This includes offices overseeing air pollution, water pollution, land contamination (including Superfund sites), and chemicals and pesticides.

The direction, issued to staff on May 13, codifies and expands an effort to effectively “cook the books” that was initiated by former Administrator Scott Pruitt. In April 2018, Pruitt told attendees at a meeting held at the Heritage Foundation – a think tank known for promoting climate science denial – that he would stop counting the co-benefits of environmental policies.

It is “potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits.”

This trend in fudging the numbers goes back to 2017, when the EPA under Pruitt made what appeared to be a few small changes to a metric known as the social cost of carbon – a figure that agencies use to determine the climate benefits of a particular regulation. In this case, the EPA argued it should only have to calculate how methane emissions reductions benefit the United States alone, a complete reversal from how these costs are typically calculated.

One of the main regulations currently in the agency’s cross-hairs is the MATS rule; introduced in 2011, it established federal limits on hazardous pollution from power plants. The regulation targets chemicals like mercury that can cause serious health impacts such as tremors, respiratory failure, and death. Coal plants are the biggest emitters of this toxic pollution.

The EPA’s own calculations show these regulations save upwards of 17,000 lives each year. Yet the agency is now arguing that the policy is too costly, claiming it costs industry $9.6 billion per year while only producing up to $6 million in benefits — significantly fewer benefits than what the Obama administration said the policy creates.

According the Obama-era calculations, the MATS rule would save $80 billion, in part due the co-benefits of costs avoided through fewer hospital visits and other health care spending resulting from poor air quality.

Among these benefits are ones that come from reducing pollution 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller (PM 2.5, for context, is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). While pollution standards set a limit on how much of this pollution is allowed, scientists argue there is no safe level, as even the tiniest particles in very small quantities are believed to impact the brains of unborn children.

But Trump’s EPA doesn’t see it that way, arguing these co-benefits are a stretch for what can be considered cost savings — and that regulating mercury from power plants is therefore not “appropriate and necessary.”

It’s a “biased and misleading estimate of costs and benefits,” Michael Livermore, associate professor of law at University of Virginia, said during a House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday regarding the proposed changes to MATS.

“The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to understand consequences of agency decisions,” Livermore told lawmakers. “By excluding a large category… [you’re] turning a blind eye to an enormous category of consequences,” he said of the number of lives at risk from pollution.

Just hours later, the EPA released its memo to expand its cost-benefit revisions.

Meanwhile, regarding the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the New York Times reported Monday that “the EPA plans to get thousands of pollution deaths off the books by changing its math.”

An EPA impact analysis released last August found that repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new rule – the Affordable Clean Energy plan – would lead to an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

The agency was ridiculed at the time for this admission, and now appears to be trying to reverse course. By adopting a different analytical method, according to the Times, the EPA will be able to reduce this number in order to defend its rollback of the Clean Power Plan.

Many experts, however, warn that there is no scientific basis to the EPA’s reported approach of assuming there are little to no health benefits from reducing pollution as much as possible. The methodology is expected to be made public in June as part of its Affordable Clean Energy rule roll-out.

“The EPA’s current agenda is to mislead and misrepresent the harms of the current Trump rollback agenda,” John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told ThinkProgress.

“But,” he added, “there’s also a future dimension – to handcuff the EPA and prevent them from protecting Americans and the environment.”

Targeting the science-based economics supporting air pollution regulations “would have very, very broad impacts,” Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, told ThinkProgress.

Revesz says the EPA is undercutting the science in three ways, under what he calls the “dirty trinity” — methods that are “extraordinarily flawed and inconsistent with what administrations [both Democrat and Republican]… have done for decades.”

The first method is by calling into question the co-benefits. “I see what the agency proposed in MATS as potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits,” he said, pointing to the EPA’s memo released this week calling on the four offices to reevaluate their cost-benefit analysis.

The next method is by calling into question the benefit of reducing particle pollution to below the national ambient air quality standards on PM 2.5. According to Revesz, the EPA’s logic espoused by the head of air quality, Bill Wehrum, is essentially to say there’s no extra benefit of reducing levels of PM 2.5 below what’s required under the national standards. This “flies in the face” of what previous administrations have done and what science has established, Revesz said.

Finally, he said the administration is trying to call into question previous studies on the harmful health impacts of particle pollution.

The impact of such a “comprehensive attack,” said NRDC’s Walke, is that “the outcome of the agency’s tortured analysis would indicate that greater protections are not justified.”

The proposed changes aren’t just opposed by scientists, environmentalists, and legal experts. They’re also, in the context of MATS, opposed by the utility industry, which has already spent billions of dollars to upgrade its facilities to be in line with the pollution rules. If MATS were to be halted, they would risk not recuperating the costs put into these upgrades.

So why do something so widely opposed? Janet McCabe, former acting EPA air chief, was posed this very question on Tuesday. “I don’t know, but I can think of two reasons why they would do this,” she told lawmakers during the MATS hearing. One of these is to “inaugurate this new way of looking at benefits, and devaluing the full range of benefits.”

The other, she said, is that “this administration has made very clear they will do everything they can to help the coal industry, and this rule is top of that list.”

While it’s hard to know exactly what is going through the minds of EPA officials when introducing these changes, the broader theme across their actions points to an industry-friendly agenda.

Given the widespread opposition to these proposed changes, Pew said, “it appears [EPA Administrator] Wheeler and Wehrum are acting in the interests of a very narrow group of companies, such as Murray Energy, Wheeler’s former client, that want the MATS rule to be withdrawn.”

In 2016, coal giant Murray Energy filed a lawsuit asking a federal appeals court to evaluate the EPA’s finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit was seen as a way to challenge the EPA’s longstanding practice of considering co-benefits in its cost analysis for regulatory decisions.

As for the new math on the Clean Power Plan’s repeal, that too is tied to a former client of an EPA official.

In 2015, the Utility Air Regulatory Group — which is known for fighting clean air policies and lobbying against the Clean Power Plan — was represented by Wehrum, then a corporate lawyer at Hunton & Williams. The firm filed comments to the EPA on behalf of UARG, arguing that recognizing the benefits of saving lives and reducing PM 2.5 pollution below required levels “fail a common sense test.”

According to the Times this week, Wehrum echoed this logic, arguing that the premise that you can save billions by reducing pollution in areas that already meet the national standard “doesn’t make any sense.”

While the administration is taking the initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan, it claims it is not actually going to roll back MATS itself.

Some critics remain skeptical, however, and argue that by undoing the science that supports MATS, the EPA is opening the door for industry to challenge the rule all together — why have a rule if the agency’s own math says there aren’t many benefits?

Asked whether the EPA understands it is leaving this standard legally vulnerable, McCabe said she thinks it does. “If people think the EPA is not going to be asked to move forward to vacate the rule… they are mistaken,” she said. “The request will come immediately.”

It’s a “deeply cynical strategy,” Walke told ThinkProgress of the EPA’s attempt to undo the science while at the same time claiming it wants to keep MATS in place.

Doing this could “encourage litigation” by Murray Energy and others to undo the MATS rule, Pew said. “If that litigation were successful, there would be a race to the bottom for power companies to turn off or turn down their pollution controls.”

Coal company Peabody Energy has also indicated that the end result of the agency’s reevaluation to its cost calculations could be the entire undoing of the sweeping toxic pollution rule.

The chances of this type of lawsuit being successful, however, are hard to predict. But many expect it would be a long-fought battle — and that those fighting to keep the pollution controls in place would be able to point to the EPA’s questionable cost calculations and the established science to argue in support of the rules.

“I don’t think, in the end, they’ll be able to survive judicial scrutiny,” said Revesz, who believes the intention is designed to open the door to undermine co-benefits across policy areas rather than spur litigation.

The probability that the courts would uphold the EPA’s “flawed economic analysis” is “very low” he explained, because these actions are “inconsistent with regulatory practice, economics, science. They make no logical sense.”"
Dept. of Justice announces arrests in Shenandoah County heroin ring,https://www.whsv.com,['Whsv Newsroom'],,,,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Dept-of-Justice-announces-arrests-in-Shenandoah-County-heroin-ring-510389691.html,"On Friday, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Virginia State Police, Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office, and Woodstock Police Department teamed up for a joint press conference to announce charges in what they call a ""heroin pipeline"" to the Shenandoah Valley.

According to U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen, a federal grand jury returned six indictments this week for five people in connection with heroin that was trafficked from Maryland into Shenandoah County.

That heroin led to one fatal overdose, as well as another overdose where the victim survived.

An indictment for five people was returned under seal on May 21 and unsealed later in the week after arrests were made.

The grand jury charged 52-year-old Craig Allen Kidwell and 54-year-old Norma Lynda Kidwell, of Mount Jackson, each with one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute 100 grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of heroin resulting in death and resulting in serious bodily injury, as well as a count of distribution and possession with the intent to distribute resulting in death and injury.

The overdose victims were labeled as only J.H. for the victim who died and J.W. as the victim who survived with serious injury.

In addition, 52-year-old James Harold Lichliter, of Mauretown, 42-year-old Stacy Allen Marston, of Woodstock, and 42-year-old Jonathan Dale Neice, of Woodstock, were each charged with one count of distribution and possession with the intent to distribute resulting in the death of J.H. and the serious bodily injury of J.W.

""Over the last two years, more Americans have died from fatal opioid overdoses than the total number of troops killed during the Vietnam War,"" Cullen stated. ""In order to mitigate this public health crisis, we will aggressively prosecute street dealers and corrupt health-care providers whose unlawful activities directly result in harm to others.""

Cullen credited local partners in Shenandoah County for bringing the individuals to justice.

According to the indictment for each of the people involved, a Maryland-based drug trafficking network began selling controlled substances to Virginia-based traffickers around June 2017.

Those traffickers then took the drugs to Shenandoah County for redistribution.

The indictment alleges Craig Kidwell and his wife, Norma, repeatedly traveled from their Shenandoah County home to Maryland to get heroin from the Maryland drug ring. At times, the indictment says, the heroin they brought back was mixed with deadly drugs like fentanyl.

Once they had the drugs, the Kidwells allegedly transported them back to Shenandoah County, where they were distributed to others, including Lichliter, Marston, and Neice, who then redistributed them to others around Shenandoah County.

One person, J.H., died from an overdose caused by the drugs provided from this network in December of 2017, and J.W. was injured. Those two overdoses launched the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office's investigation, which uncovered the chain of distributors and suppliers.

""The resulting indictments should serve as a warning of what will happen to those who make it their business to exploit and profit from the members of our community,"" stated Special Agent in Charge Jesse R. Fong of the Drug Enforcement Administration Washington Division. ""We will remain relentless with our local partners in holding drug dealers accountable for poisoning our citizens.""

The investigation was carried out by the DEA, Virginia State Police, the Shenandoah County Sheriff's Office, and the Woodstock Police Department.

Justice Dept. Says It Will Share Some Mueller-Related Intelligence With House Committee,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/mueller-report-democrats.html,"The Intelligence Committee appears to be getting material that was not subject to the privilege claim. As one of two congressional bodies charged with overseeing American intelligence agencies, it has strong legal claims on such counterintelligence and intelligence information, and in this case, the Democrats requesting the material had the support of Republicans on the committee.

It is unclear if the department will reconsider Mr. Trump’s privilege claim going forward. Democrats plan to challenge it in court and to hold a House vote in early June on holding Mr. Barr in contempt for his defiance of the Judiciary Committee’s subpoena.

“This is no substitute in any way, shape or form for the appearance of Bob Mueller before our committee and the Judiciary Committee,” Mr. Schiff told reporters. “It’s no substitute for the appearance of Don McGahn and the other witnesses that have been subpoenaed to come before the committee. But we are pleased we are finally going to start to receive documents we are entitled to from the Department of Justice.”

Still, the de-escalation comes as liberal Democratic lawmakers are increasingly restless over the administration’s stonewalling of congressional requests and subpoenas, and a growing number have begun calling for the opening of an impeachment inquiry. The cooperation will likely strengthen the hand of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies, who have argued instead that Democrats should stay the course of their current no-impeachment strategy.

The Justice Department wrote in a letter to Mr. Schiff on Tuesday that it was already in the process of locating and reviewing materials related to the 12 categories and could make them available in “relatively short order.”

But the department has stated that it would comply in this way only if the committee did not proceed with the previously scheduled vote on its enforcement action.

“The proposal set forth above represents a good-faith effort and extraordinary accommodation of the committee’s request for information by proposing a realistic process to provide the committee with information pertaining to counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence activities related to the special counsel’s investigation,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the Tuesday letter.

The department said it was also willing to allow all members of the Intelligence Committee to view a limited redacted version of the first volume of Mr. Mueller’s report. It had previously allowed only a handful of lawmakers in both the House and Senate to see those materials."
Veterans Affairs is changing for the better,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/veterans-affairs-is-changing-for-the-better,"President Abraham Lincoln once said, “I am not concerned that you have fallen — I am concerned that you arise.”

Like any large organization, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its share of problems.

But under President Trump’s leadership, the VA is living up to Lincoln’s ideals by finding ways to fix those problems from past administrations.

When we realized our claim-appeals process was complex and inefficient, we worked with veterans service organizations, Congress, and the president to draft and pass a new law designed to fix it and put veterans first.

We launched a 24/7 White House VA hotline to help veterans cut through red tape and serve as an important feedback mechanism that lets agency leaders identify trends, spot problems more quickly, and drive improvements across the department.

And after Trump promised to give veterans more healthcare choices, we worked with Congress to do just that by passing the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, or MISSION, Act, which will consolidate our community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that puts veterans at the center of their healthcare decisions.

But perhaps the best example of VA’s continuous improvement on behalf of veterans is the progress we’ve made in expanding accessibility to, and quality of, the healthcare we deliver.

When it comes to access, a January study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that by 2017, VA had significantly shorter wait times for primary care, cardiology, and dermatology than private doctors. The study said the data it collected is “further supporting the finding that access to care has improved over time within the VA.”

That improvement came even as the VA was steadily seeing more patients.

In December, a Dartmouth study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that care at the VA was “significantly better” than the care found in non-VA facilities in 14 of 15 categories. “We found that VHA hospitals provided the best care in most referral regions and rarely provided the worst care,” the study found.

Our focus on customer service is part of the reason for these improvements. Our Veterans Experience Office is constantly assessing our performance and giving us the feedback we need to identify and resolve problems.

That office has been so successful that the Trump administration is using it as a model to develop customer service strategies across the entire government. This summer, lessons learned at the VA will be used to develop customer service plans at more than two dozen major federal agencies.

The cornerstone of our commitment to improving customer service is our willingness to acknowledge that things aren’t perfect and that change is a good thing. That’s the attitude we have as we prepare to undergo the biggest transition in our history: implementing the MISSION Act.

Under that law, which we’ll start implementing on June 6, our community care programs will be streamlined into a single program, and veterans will be able to more easily access outside care when necessary or when VA care is simply too far away.

This landmark change won’t supplant VA or cause the quality of its care to diminish. It will support our mission by improving its ability to get veterans the care they need when and where they need it.

This Memorial Day, I urge all Americans to remember the more than 1 million service members who gave their lives for our freedom in the several wars we’ve fought during the history of this country. At the VA, we are undergoing change at a rate that hasn’t been seen since the end of World War II to improve the lives of our living veterans.

We are welcoming these challenges as the best way to live up to the charge Lincoln laid on the nation after the Civil War — that we continue “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.”

USDA unveils $16B in new aid for farmers burned by trade war,https://www.politico.com,"['Catherine Boudreau', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Alex Isenstadt', 'James Arkin']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/farmers-aid-trade-relief-1469225,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the department will not be donating U.S. commodities to foreign countries, as President Donald Trump had said earlier this month. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Agriculture USDA unveils $16B in new aid for farmers burned by trade war

The Agriculture Department said that it would provide $16 billion to farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs under a second trade-relief program announced Thursday.

The bulk of the money, or $14.5 billion, will be spent on direct payments to farmers producing a wider range of crops and livestock. Last year, USDA faced criticism after some of the package didn’t benefit crops that were not directly targeted by retaliatory tariffs but were still hurt by disruptions in international markets.

Story Continued Below

“The plan we are announcing today ensures farmers do not bear the brunt of unfair retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. “Our team at USDA reflected on what worked well and gathered feedback on last year’s program to make this one even stronger and more effective for farmers.”

The department also plans to purchase $1.4 billion worth of surplus commodities and invest $100 million in programs promoting U.S. farm products overseas, top USDA officials said during a conference call.

Perdue also said the department will not be donating U.S. commodities to foreign countries, as President Donald Trump had said earlier this month, after he learned of the inefficiency and potential market disruptions of such a move.

Trump had also proposed using tariff revenue to fund the new support for farmers, but USDA will once again use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy, and borrows from the U.S. Treasury.

Trump acknowledged that politics is playing a role in the trade war and his decision to send support to farmers — and not any other industry reeling from foreign retaliation.

“China has openly stated they're going to use the farmer. The reason is because I got the farmers‘ votes. It's red. Republican. Trump,” the president said during an event at the White House on Thursday about the new aid package. “Farmers have been attacked by China. I'm trying to get the flat level playing field.“

The direct payment portion of the aid package has a more complex design than the Trump administration’s version last year. It is also based on a longer-term evaluation of the harm of the trade disputes on U.S. agricultural exports.

USDA officials said the change addresses concerns from lawmakers and economists that another round of aid would influence farmers’ planting decisions this spring.

The amount of money farmers growing crops like soybeans, corn, cotton and wheat will receive largely depend on the county they live in, rather than the specific crops they grow.

USDA officials said they estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes, and will multiply that by the acreage farmers plant this year. Farmers who don’t put a crop in the ground this year won’t be eligible for for the program.

Dairy and pork producers, as well as farmers growing products like tree nuts, sweet cherries and cranberries, also are eligible for direct payments.

The department plans to send out money in three phases: the first by July or early August, and the second two if warranted because the Trump administration still hasn’t resolved a trade dispute with China.

USDA had to move rapidly to design the new trade-relief program after Trump promised farmers and ranchers that he would reimburse them for continued trade losses after negotiations with China stumbled earlier this month. The department had made up to $12 billion available to farmers in its initial trade relief program, which was for 2018 losses, and Perdue had been warning agricultural producers since late last year that there would be no more aid for 2019 production.

Trump’s declaration of new support for farmers sent officials scrambling to come up with a new plan to dole out billions of dollars in assistance.

A number of Democratic lawmakers on Thursday raised concerns about the rushed roll out. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, said in a statement that the USDA’s plan leaves farmers and ranchers with more questions than answers.

“I have a number of concerns about whether this plan is fair and equitable to all farmers,“ Stabenow said. “Government checks are no replacement for lost markets, and this temporary support will only go so far.”

Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.), who leads the House Agriculture Committee’s livestock panel, described USDA’s plan as rushed and poorly planned, raising the possibility that fruits and vegetable crops will receive a possibly reduced level of aid.

Even though USDA has said the program is designed not to influence farmers' spring planting decisions, some lawmakers and agriculture economists have said the mere timing of the announcement could affect decisions because planting for several commodities is behind schedule due to flooding in the Midwest.

""There’s something about announcing this right now that may be satisfying to the farmers, but it might influence people to move from corn to soybeans,"" Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Thursday during a call with reporters that preceded USDA's announcement. ""And I think USDA ought to withhold just a little while so farmers plant according to the market and not according to what the government might do to help them.""

The American Farm Bureau Federation and corn, soybean, wheat and pork organizations will meet at the White House later on Thursday to discuss the new aid program with officials.

Several farm groups — including the National Farmers Union and National Pork Producers Council — said Thursday that the new trade package is an improvement from last year’s version. Both stressed that the aid is a short-term fix to a long term problem and urged the Trump administration to expand market access overseas and resolve the trade dispute with China.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who for weeks has been trying to secure another round of trade aid for farmers, said that better trade deals are ultimately what is needed. However, China’s move to backtrack in trade negotiations made the aid necessary.

“Not only will this help our farmers, but supporting our agriculture industry will send a clear message to China that the U.S. will do what it takes to get better trade deals,” he said.
