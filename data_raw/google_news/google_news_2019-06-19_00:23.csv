Trump says millions in U.S. illegally to be deported starting next week,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-immigration-tweet-millions-in-us-illegally-removed-starting-next-week-mass-immigration-arrests-conversations/,"President Trump says millions of people living in the country illegally will be deported, beginning next week. In a pair of tweets Monday night — the eve of formally announcing his re-election bid — Mr. Trump said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would next week ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.""

""They will be removed as fast as they come in,"" he wrote.

....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who won’t do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes, and fix asylum! If so, Border Crisis will end quickly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019

An administration official told The Associated Press the effort would focus on the more than 1 million people who have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges but remain at large in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to explain the president's tweets. The largest number of people deported by ICE was 409,824 in 2012.

It is unusual for law enforcement agencies to announce raids before they take place. ICE rarely announces operations in advance, especially large-scale ones like the one Mr. Trump addressed. The Washington Post reported in May that before the ouster of then Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the White House pushed DHS — which oversees ICE — to conduct a sprawling operation targeting undocumented immigrants in major cities. That operation would have entailed the arrest of as many as 10,000 immigrants, not ""millions.""

Any such massive deportation blitz would affect not only undocumented immigrants with pending removal orders, but millions of mixed-status families with members who are U.S. citizens, particularly children.

Some in Mr. Trump's administration believe decisive shows of force — such as mass arrests — can serve as effective deterrents, sending a message to those considering making the journey to the U.S. that it's not worth the effort.

Mr. Trump has threatened a series of increasingly drastic actions as he has tried to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the southern border, a flow that has risen dramatically on his watch. He recently dropped a threat to slap tariffs on Mexico after the country agreed to dispatch its national guard and step-up coordination and enforcement efforts.

A senior Mexican official said Monday that, three weeks ago, about 4,200 migrants were arriving at the U.S. border daily and that the number has dropped to about 2,600.

Also on Monday, the U.S. government officially announced it would cut millions of dollars in foreign aid to Central America, warning governments in the region that assistance will only resume when they do more to prevent their citizens from migrating.

The move, which the president ordered in late March, disrupts a long-standing pillar of American foreign policy supported by most Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Lawmakers had been urging the administration to reverse course, fearing the end of American assistance will only exasperate the rampant poverty, deep-rooted political instability and widespread insecurity in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, collectively known as the ""Northern Triangle.""

Immigration was a central theme of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and he is expected to hammer it as he tries to fire up his base heading into the 2020 campaign.

Mr. Trump will formally launch his re-election bid Tuesday night at a rally in Orlando, Florida — a state that is crucial to his possible path back to the White House."
Michael Savage Has Doubts About Trump. His Conservative Radio Audience Does Not.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeremy W. Peters'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/michael-savage-trump.html,"His anti-Trump stances have come at a cost. Though his show is still rated among the top 10 for talk radio, he no longer has as large a national following after several major stations in markets like New York City and Washington took him off the air. His live show is now only one hour, cut back from three last year.

Mr. Savage has always been an eccentric character in the world of conservative talk radio. His background is not in politics but plants. He studied medicinal properties in plants in Hawaii and Fiji and earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine, a field that examines how various cultures and ethnicities use natural products for health purposes. His affinity for the Bay Area is one that few conservatives share.

He wrote numerous books about health under his birth name, Michael Alan Weiner. He picked Savage as his radio name after Charles Savage, a sailor who is believed to be the first to introduce firearms to Fiji but was eventually murdered by the islanders.

Mr. Savage turned to radio, he said, after being denied repeatedly for jobs as a professor. “White males need not apply,” he said. “And I remember to this day the humiliation.”

[Who is leading the race to go up against President Trump in 2020?]

Though he is disillusioned with the Trump administration in many ways, he still takes pride in his role as an early supporter. He often tells the story about the evening in 2017 when he visited Mar-a-Lago as a guest of Christopher Ruddy, the president’s friend and chief executive of Newsmax. When Mr. Trump saw Mr. Savage, he threw his arm around him and said loudly enough for anyone within earshot to hear, “I wouldn’t be president without this man.”

Mr. Savage insists he does not need or crave that kind of access anymore. He believes enough people in his audience would see through it as phony if he did, he said, because they appreciate his independence even if they don’t share his skepticism.

“The day they think I’ve been turned and I’m willing to sell myself out for a pat on the head or another piece of Hanukkah candy,” he said, “they’re going to say he’s just like the rest of them. ‘He’ll do anything for access to the king.’”"

Some had been camped in chairs for several nights, others traveled from afar, but almost all were there to show their unwavering support for Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. The rally was slated to start at 8 p.m. ET.

“He kept his promises, he is passionate about America. He wants to keep us safe, I am tired of people hating on him. He is doing his best to defend us,” Alan Machapento, a New Jersey native, told Fox News. “I am watching the Dow, we have the lowest unemployment ever.”

Meanwhile, Marcia Tracy and her teen grandson, Ashton Smith of South Jacksonville, woke up at the crack of dawn in anticipation of the momentous occasion when Trump was to announce he is seeking a second term.

“From the moment he said he was running, I was a Trump fan,” Tracy enthused, stressing she was in no way disappointed with his performance. “He is not a politician, and I am so glad my grandson is going to grow up in an America that is great.”

In her view, Trump is a man of his word and has brought jobs back, so “we all can proudly say things are made in America” again.

Her biggest hope ahead of the 2020 showdown?

“Build the wall,” Tracy exclaimed.

Her grandson, Ashton, at just 15, acknowledged that while he is too young to vote, being involved in such rallies had given him impetus to “form his own opinions” and think about what issues are of importance, namely future job opportunities.

The intensity of the event only grew as more poured in throughout the morning.

Every kind of cap and shirt and mug and poncho was being hawked in corners far and wide, with slogans ranging from “God, Guns and Trump” to “Trump’s Deplorables” to “Working to Defeat Liberals since 1854.”

“Bikers For Trump” volunteer security members managed traffic in and out of the rally areas as jubilant Trump devotees partied to a band while in line, occasionally breaking into “USA, USA"" chants.

Others wandered the blocks around the venue urging people to sign a petition to “prevent voter fraud.”

“Only U.S. citizens should be able to vote,” explained Donny, a Jacksonville native. “That’s what we want in Florida.”

Meanwhile, Pamela Simpson of Fort Pierce, Fla., said she was more than pleased with the Trump team’s efforts in the area of criminal justice reform.

“There are a lot of mothers and women sitting in jail and they are (working on reforms),” she said. “We need to believe in America and we are on the right track. It is Congress that is not.”

Joining her under the warm sun was 80-year-old Barbara Miller from Orlando, who said she had been working since the age of 13 and was a big believer in promoting business.

In order to secure his next term, the president would almost certainly need to snag Florida, which has long been considered one of the most strategic voter battlegrounds in America.

While many of Trump’s policies and mannerisms have been maligned in the media in recent years, many at the rally said they came out to ensure that it was not indicative of how the whole country thinks and feels.

“I am here for Trump, I love his attitude,” said Cherie Colgram, from Clermont, Fla. “He is making things happen, he is still working on the border issue. I’m voting for him again.”

Official requests over the loudspeakers reminded the crowd that while President Trump supports both the First and Second amendments, the event was paid for by Trump and designated areas “outside the venue were put in place for those wishing to protest.”

With that, a chant of “God Bless America” rose from the groups."
William Barr’s Justice Department Is Now Openly Running Legal Interference for Paul Manafort,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/paul-manafort-william-barr-new-york-prison.html,"President Donald Trump listens to Attorney General William Barr during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on May 22 in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has decided to run interference for Paul Manafort, protecting him from harsh imprisonment and even questioning the validity of charges brought against him by state prosecutors. This effort to aid the president’s loyal associate behind bars is a startling escalation of Attorney General William Barr’s campaign to help Trump and his confederates evade consequences for their misdeeds.

Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2018 then pleaded guilty to illegal foreign lobbying and witness tampering. He was first prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who secured a 7.5-year federal prison sentence earlier this year. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance then brought 16 additional charges under New York law. Manafort is currently housed in Loretto, a federal prison in southwest Pennsylvania, and Vance’s office requested his transfer to a New York facility. (Typically, federal prisoners awaiting trial in New York state court are held in the notoriously brutal Rikers Island jail.)

In May, Manafort attorney Todd Blanche wrote a letter to Vicky Moser, Loretto’s warden, protesting this transfer. Blanche asked that Manafort be allowed to remain in Loretto to address his “health challenges” and preserve his “reasonable access to counsel.” And Blanche had another reason his client deserved special treatment: Manafort, Blanche alleged, “is being prosecuted in New York for exactly the same conduct for which he has already been tried and sentenced” in federal court. The New York prosecution thus “appears to be a blatant violation” of the state’s “long-standing and highly protective” double jeopardy laws. Condemning Vance’s actions as “politics at its worst,” Blanche declared that Vance is “attempting to add insult to injury” by placing his client on Rikers Island. In other words, Manafort should not be moved to New York because the New York charges against him are invalid.

By itself, this letter would be unremarkable, a plea from his top-shelf lawyer that Manafort be treated better than virtually every other inmate in the United States. What is remarkable—indeed, shocking—is that the deputy attorney general, the second-highest law enforcement official in the country, seemed to implicitly endorse Blanche’s complaints. On June 11, Jeffrey Rosen forwarded the letter to Vance’s office and asked for a “response” before federal officials made “a decision” about moving Manafort to New York. Rosen even gave Vance a deadline, asking him to respond within a week.

Rosen’s letter creates the impression that the Justice Department is working to undermine state charges against Manafort.

On June 14, Vance responded to Rosen granting Blanche’s request. He also forwarded Rosen a separate letter written by Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy to Loretto’s warden. Conroy described the proposed arrangement as “a departure from usual practice” and “inconsistent” with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. But the district attorney would allow it anyway, almost certainly because Rosen threw the weight of the Department of Justice behind the effort to protect Manafort and attack state charges that Trump would not be able to pardon.

Conroy further noted that the district attorney’s office never actually tried to put Manafort at Rikers Island; it merely sought “temporary custody” in any nearby facility so Manafort could be “made available for arraignment and subsequent proceedings in a timely manner.” Regardless, the district attorney would let Manafort remain at Loretto so long as the feds promised to make him available in New York court “without interruption or delay.”

Vance himself responded to Blanche’s accusations that the New York charges are an illegal violation of double jeopardy. These “gratuitous” arguments, Vance wrote, “have no place in a routine procedural analysis” of inmate relocation. Conroy’s letter also pointed out that if Manafort “believes he has valid statutory double jeopardy” defenses, he “will have a full opportunity to pursue” them in New York court.

For the record, Blanche is probably right that some charges in the New York indictment should fall under the state’s unusually strict double jeopardy regime. But Vance brought other charges under state laws with elements and purposes distinct from their federal counterparts that could to fall outside of double jeopardy protections. For instance, New York laws criminalizing the falsification of business records differ substantially from the federal fraud charges for which Manafort was convicted. While Blanche can mount a plausible argument that the New York indictment runs afoul of state double jeopardy charges, it is certainly not so clear-cut that the state charges should be treated as entirely illegitimate.

I happen to think that no one should be housed in Rikers Island, a hotbed of human rights abuses that ought to be permanently shuttered. I also think states should be prohibited from prosecuting an individual for a crime already punished by the federal government. But I do not believe that the United States Department of Justice should intervene on behalf of the president’s associate to secure benefits for him that no other prisoner receives. It is, in fact, an appalling perversion of the agency’s putative integrity, particularly in light of persistent speculation that Trump may pardon Manafort.

If he does, the task will fall to states to hold Manafort accountable for his crimes, since the president cannot pardon state offenses. Rosen’s letter creates two inescapable impressions: First, that the Department of Justice—so recently responsible for putting Manafort behind bars—is now attempting to keep him as comfortable as possible until Trump issues his pardon; and second, that the DOJ is working to undermine the validity of state charges against Manafort so that he would not languish in state prison if he receives a presidential pardon.

None of this is surprising with Barr in control of the DOJ. A chronic liar and smear artist, Barr has swiftly sullied the agency, turning it into an especially powerful arm of Trump’s PR machine. He and his deputies have all but announced that they have Manafort’s back. Even as the DOJ slow-walks and obstructs the implementation of the First Step Act, keeping rehabilitated prisoners incarcerated for no reason, it helps protect Manafort from the cruelties of the criminal justice system. This is a level of corruption usually only seen in kleptocratic nations. Now it’s right out in the open in these United States."
"U.S. Justice Dept. keeps Manafort in federal custody, citing health, personal safety",https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-manafort/us-justice-department-keeps-manafort-in-federal-custody-citing-health-personal-safety-idUSKCN1TJ1N6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Convicted felon Paul Manafort will remain in federal custody, a U.S. Justice Department official said on Tuesday, citing concerns about the “health and personal safety” of President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman if he was transferred to a local facility in New York.

Manafort, serving a 7-1/2-year sentence for tax fraud, bank fraud and other charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, faces New York state charges related to residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records.

The veteran Republican political operative had been expected to be transferred any day from a federal prison in Pennsylvania to a New York City-operated jail to face the state charges.

But Manafort, 70, was transferred on Monday to the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a federal facility in Manhattan. On Tuesday, The Bureau of Prisons’ website showed Manafort was there.

In a statement, a senior Justice Department official said Manafort’s attorneys told the Bureau of Prisons they were concerned about “his health and personal safety” in local custody.

New York prosecutors did not object to the move, which would make Manafort available to the state when needed, according to letters obtained by Reuters.

“In light of New York’s position, and Mr. Manafort’s unique health and safety needs, the department determined to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in federal custody during the pendency of his state proceedings,” the official said. “This arrangement will not have any impact on his state proceedings.”

It is not clear if Manafort will remain at the MCC or return to Pennsylvania following his arraignment.

The MCC, which houses around 800 inmates, is where drug kingpin “El Chapo” is behind bars. Other criminals who have spent time there include Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, mob boss John Gotti, and “Blind Sheikh” militant Omar Abdel-Rahman.

In a May letter sent to the warden of FCI Loretto, the low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania where Manafort was housed before the transfer, Manafort’s lawyer said his client had suffered “health challenges” that would “best be addressed” by remaining at Loretto.

If transferred to New York, Manafort would likely be kept in solitary confinement at Rikers Island, a city jail that is “unsecure, unsanitary and dangerous,” attorney Todd Blanche wrote.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the Justice Department’s new No. 2 under Attorney General William Barr, sent a copy of the letter to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance on June 11.

Vance replied that his office never said Manafort should be kept at Rikers or placed in solitary confinement, according to a copy of his letter.

Manafort should be turned over to New York state or kept in a federal facility in New York City, but Vance’s office said it would not object if he were housed in Pennsylvania.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a request for comment.

Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, said it was a “perfectly appropriate exercise of power by federal authorities” to keep Manafort in federal custody.

“Rikers Island sounds like a punitive measure,” Giuliani said. He declined to comment on whether Trump had any say in the decision.

Trump has not ruled out an eventual pardon for Manafort. However, any presidential pardon would apply only to federal crimes and not to any state convictions.

Former federal prosecutor Roland Riopelle said Manafort’s situation was unique because he is an “ally of the president.”

“The agreement to keep Manafort in federal custody while he is being prosecuted in the state is, in my experience, unusual,” Riopelle said, though he added that it also was unusual to have dual prosecutions like Manafort’s.

Riopelle cautioned that the MCC was no walk in the park.

“It’s a high-security federal prison with very little opportunity for outdoor exercise,” Riopelle said."
"Shanahan Withdraws as Defense Secretary Nominee, and Mark Esper Is Named Acting Pentagon Chief",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Helene Cooper']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/patrick-shanahan-defense-secretary.html,"In addition to Mr. Esper, who was confirmed as secretary of the Army in November 2017, officials said Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Richard V. Spencer, the secretary of the Navy, were on the short list for defense secretary.

Mr. Shanahan’s divorce generated 4,700 pages in numerous filings in King County Superior Court in Seattle. The court documents, which were viewed by The New York Times, paint a portrait of a family torn apart by different views on how the three Shanahan children should be raised, as well as over Mr. Shanahan’s extended absences while he was at Boeing.

Two particular incidents stand out. On the night of Aug. 27, 2010, at the couple’s residence in Seattle, Mr. Shanahan’s wife at the time, Kimberley Jordinson Shanahan, called 911 after a fight with Mr. Shanahan. According to a statement from the couple’s son, the two argued over, among other things, a briefcase belonging to Mr. Shanahan that Mrs. Shanahan wanted to open.

Mr. Shanahan refused to allow his wife to take the briefcase, and a tug of war ensued. “My dad yanked the briefcase out of my mom’s hands and put it in the trunk of his car,” the couple’s oldest son, William C. Shanahan, said in the statement. “Then he slammed the trunk and locked the car. My mom was yelling, ‘Get the briefcase, get the briefcase.’”

Ms. Jordinson told the police that Mr. Shanahan punched her in the stomach while trying to take back the briefcase. He denied that accusation, and police charged her with domestic violence, but then dropped the charge.

The second incident took place in Florida on Nov. 23, 2011, after the couple’s divorce in September of that year. According to a statement from Ms. Jordinson, William Shanahan, then 17, attacked his mother after she confronted him about a relationship that she said he was having with the family’s 36-year-old former nanny. Ms. Jordinson said William pinned her against a wall and then got a baseball bat, “which he used to hit me repeatedly in the head, back, arms, neck, left and right hip, and the back of my legs.”"
Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for the DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."

"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

"Pete Buttigieg says ""it's almost certain"" he wouldn't be first gay president",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buttigieg-weve-probably-had-excellent-presidents-who-were-gay/,"2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg could make history as the youngest president in the history of the United States — and the first openly gay one. Buttigieg, however, believes he wouldn't be the only gay president.

Pete Buttigieg Axios on HBO

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out as gay in 2015, before being elected to his second term as mayor. He is now married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman, who would become first gentleman if Buttigieg wins the presidency.

In an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" Buttigieg was asked about critics potentially saying he's too young, too liberal and too gay to be commander-in-chief.

He was asked, ""You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""

""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country,"" the candidate replied. ""People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

Buttigieg said ""statistically, it's almost certain"" that there has been a gay president before. Of course, none have been openly gay, and almost every president, except for two, have been married to women.

An estimated 4.5 percent of the U.S. population is LGBTQ, a 2018 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found. So Buttigieg's assumption that at least one out of the nation's 45 presidents was gay is not so far-fetched — he just doesn't know which one.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively,"" he told Axios. ""But one can only assume that's the case."""
House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersDem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes Dem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes House panel OKs space military branch MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, will announce the agenda during remarks Tuesday afternoon at the International Summit on Borders in Washington, D.C.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Rep. Pete King Peter (Pete) Thomas KingGOP congressman: Trump should have been 'above' attacking Pelosi at Normandy Democratic lawmaker: Trump shouldn't be allowed to attend D-Day ceremony GOP lawmakers say Trump wrong to criticize Biden in Japan MORE (R-N.Y.) will reintroduce the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act, which would enable DHS to keep products from vendors that pose national security risks out of U.S. supply chains. This legislation was passed by the House during the last Congress, but stalled in the Senate. It had multiple bipartisan co-sponsors, including Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson Bennie Gordon ThompsonHillicon Valley: Lawmakers angered over Border Patrol breach | Senate Dems press FBI over Russian hacking response | Emails reportedly show Zuckerberg knew of Facebook's privacy issues | FCC looks to improve broadband mapping Hillicon Valley: Lawmakers angered over Border Patrol breach | Senate Dems press FBI over Russian hacking response | Emails reportedly show Zuckerberg knew of Facebook's privacy issues | FCC looks to improve broadband mapping Democrats grill FEMA over inflated payments for Hurricane Maria MORE (D-Miss.).

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) will introduce the Pipeline Security Enhancement Act, which would give DHS’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) the power to inspect and improve the physical security and cybersecurity of U.S. pipelines.

And the cybersecurity subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. John Katko John Michael KatkoHouse conservative's procedural protest met with bipartisan gripes House conservative's procedural protest met with bipartisan gripes There is a severe physician shortage and it will only worsen MORE (R-N.Y.), will introduce the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act. This legislation is designed to help DHS and its local government partners bolster their cybersecurity resiliency capacity by authorizing grants and technical assistance.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."
"‘Human capital crisis’ at EPA, retirement for 40% of staff",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/human-capital-crisis-at-epa-retirement-for-40-of-staff,"The Environmental Protection Agency is bleeding workers.

“I do have a concern absolutely. Forty percent of our workforce is eligible to retire over the next five years. While I don’t expect them all to retire in the next five years, I expect them to be gone in the next 10 years,” said Administrator Andrew Wheeler.

“I consider it a human capital crisis,” he added.

The issue is one being felt throughout government and business as baby boomers retire and younger workers come and go with much more regularity.

Wheeler, for example, said the EPA has always budgeted for workers to stay for decades. “We have a history at the agency of hiring people out of school and expecting them to stay 30, 40 years. We have 10 employees who have been here 49 years,” he said in an interview.

But that’s not happening anymore.

And, he added, government rules make it hard to start looking for a new employee before a retiring worker leaves the building. “You lose that institutional knowledge because they aren’t there to train their replacement.""

The White House, he said, is trying to give agencies more flexibility in hiring. But Wheeler said he is also taking charge, noting that he helped in the interviewing process of new EPA human resources director.

“Administrators don’t typically interview at that level,” he said, but added, “I want to meet who we’re going to hire before we hire them because on Day One I’m going to hit them with a dozen things and I want to make sure that they don’t get scared off.”"
Obama endorsement coveted as ex-president writes own script after leaving White House,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'James Varney']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/17/obama-endorsement-coveted-ex-president-writes-own-/,"Life outside the White House has been sweet for former President Barack Obama, with perhaps the most difficult thing being the one he does best: politics.

Mr. Obama is navigating a landscape in which he must fit his obvious relish for the celebrity lifestyle with an unwritten code of conduct for past chief executives, a world that is his for the taking yet tradition dictates he do so incrementally. It’s a political scene where players may covet his endorsement or desire his invisibility.

Mr. Obama enjoys tremendous post-presidential popularity within the Democratic Party’s rank and file, but he has not always followed the unwritten rules of the Presidents Club.

Rather than ride into the sunset, he still lives Washington, residing in the multimillion-dollar Kalorama neighborhood about 2 miles from the White House. He also has stayed in the limelight by taking expensive vacations with celebrities, attending major sports events, visiting charities and, most important, campaigning for fellow Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.

While there is no Emily Post for onetime leaders of the free world, former presidents typically do not thrust themselves so publicly into elections just two years after leaving office, historians say.

They also avoid criticism of their successors. President George W. Bush never voiced his opinions on the policies of the Obama administration that followed his.

Mr. Obama, on the other hand, has frequently criticized President Trump. But given the vitriol that Mr. Trump has generated from the left, Mr. Obama’s relative reticence has been noted.

“I’d say especially when you put him in comparison with the other invective that gets thrown around, some from his own people, he’s been surprisingly restrained,” said Allen C. Guelzo, an American history professor at Gettysburg College. “Tactful, even.”

The Obama endorsement

Mr. Obama’s popularity within the party and the political advocacy groups that surround him means his endorsement in the crowded field of presidential candidates would be a sought-after bouquet, although some of those close to him note he has carefully avoided picking any one Democrat when so many seek the party’s mantle.

“First of all, a former president can do whatever he wants,” said Ron Faucheux, a former Democratic elected official turned political analyst in Washington. “And I think at this time, among Democrats, an endorsement from Obama would be incredibly important.”

Yet as Mr. Faucheux and others noted, it’s unlikely an endorsement will be forthcoming.

“It isn’t appropriate,” longtime Washington analyst Charlie Cook said. “It isn’t done, unless it is someone in the family, like a son or brother.”

To the extent the next Democratic president will be continuing or building on Mr. Obama’s legacy, his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden, would seem to be the likely recipient of the coveted endorsement.

“I think every president objects to seeing their legacy dismantled,” Mr. Guelzo said. “President Trump is a major game changer on that front, and I imagine Obama has an acute anxiety about it all, as anyone would. All former presidents to some extent are bound to be zealous about preserving their legacy even if it was insubstantial.”

Not everyone believes Mr. Obama’s endorsement is necessary or would prove decisive, although it would certainly catapult a candidate lower in the polls.

“I think it might mean more if he endorsed someone other than Biden,” said one veteran Democratic presidential campaign consultant who has not gone with a candidate this time and asked to speak on background.

“It’s a delicate dance for him because this is a strange time. We’ve never had this many people running for president who you can say are legitimate candidates,” the consultant said. “But I’m not sure [an endorsement] matters that much, really. I don’t think it will matter much in the general election because Obama’s popularity doesn’t extend much beyond the already committed Democrats.”

In addition to tradition, a primary endorsement from Mr. Obama would be surprising. Some Democrats think Mr. Biden decided against running for president in 2016 partly because Mr. Obama did not offer his enthusiastic backing.

Mr. Obama’s office declined to comment on the 2020 race, but some careful observations have been offered privately.

“He believes that a robust primary in 2007 and 2008 not only made him a better general election candidate, but a better president, too,” said a person familiar with Mr. Obama’s current thinking. “And because of that, it’s unlikely that he will throw his support behind a specific candidate this early in the process.”

On the other hand, Mr. Obama has every intention of campaigning vigorously for many Democratic candidates in 2020, according to his staff. He intends to endorse, fundraise and hit the trail on behalf of congressional and gubernatorial candidates, as he did in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as helping the eventual presidential nominee.

Presidential endorsements of running mates haven’t always been smooth. Neither Dwight D. Eisenhower nor Ronald Reagan was seen as an enthusiastic backer of Richard Nixon or George H.W. Bush, respectively, and Al Gore drew criticism for supposedly keeping Bill Clinton at arm’s length when he sought the presidency in 2000.

Back in the high life again

Outside of the political realm, Mr. Obama has enjoyed life after the White House. While president, he declared that “at some point you’ve made enough money,” but that “point” appears to remain elusive for him more than two years out of office.

Last year, Mr. Obama expressed surprise at “how much money I got” in a speech in South Africa, but he insisted again there must be a limit.

“There’s only so much you can eat,” he said with a grin, according to contemporaneous accounts. “There’s only so big a house you can have. There’s only so many nice trips you can take.”

He has cavorted on the world’s most glamorous playgrounds with movie stars and business moguls. In the British Virgin Islands, where he was a guest of billionaire Richard Branson, and at an exclusive South Pacific resort, on an atoll near Tahiti, where Mr. Obama relaxed in a private villa not far from those of Bruce Springsteen and Meryl Streep.

He recently attended an NBA Finals game in Toronto, where the crowd gave him a rapturous welcome.

His family is thriving, too. His two daughters go to the finest schools. Malia attends Harvard University, and Sasha just graduated from the exclusive Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Wife Michelle’s “Becoming” memoir was the best-selling hardcover book of 2018 and sold a remarkable 10 million copies as of March, according to trade figures.

Still, for Mr. Obama, navigating lucrative post-presidential opportunities can be tricky. For those who hector the world about income inequality, living the lifestyle of the rich and famous can be problematic, and he has drawn his share of criticism from fellow liberals.

Some of their objections are rooted in the investment banking source of his lucre because speeches to Wall Street firms and investors have been a big part of it.

Mr. Obama has given at least nine speeches to Cantor Fitzgerald and other high-powered companies, and he has done so at $400,000 a pop, according to accounts.

He can command even greater fees abroad. Last week, Mr. Obama was reported to be receiving nearly $600,000 for a talk in Colombia.

Some of his longtime allies have been critical of Mr. Obama’s speaking riches.

At Vox, Matthew Yglesias said the Wall Street talks “undermined everything he believes in,” and usually adulatory outlets such as The Washington Post called it “a bad idea.”

Mr. Obama’s private staff declined to discuss his finances. They would neither confirm nor deny reported speaking fees and would not disclose how much money was involved in business deals of Mr. Obama and his wife.

The Obamas’ company Higher Ground signed a multiyear deal in 2018 with Netflix to produce vaguely defined content “to foster new, diverse voices in the entertainment biz,” as Variety described it. A similar multiyear deal for podcasts on Spotify was signed this month.

Neither the terms of the Spotify nor Netflix deals were disclosed, though Netflix shows won’t begin until 2020, according to Mr. Obama’s staff.

In the publishing world, too, the Obamas have brought in unprecedented numbers. The couple signed a $65 million deal with Penguin Random House for their political memoirs, and company executives have indicated they are pleased with the returns.

Mrs. Obama’s memoir may have garnered subtle criticism when her husband knocked it as ghostwritten, but it has been a huge bestseller. Thomas Rabe, chief executive of German media group Bertelsmann, in November called it the “most notable creative success of the last year” for the company’s publishing arm. He credited the memoir with a healthy contribution to the house’s 2.8% surge in revenue.

A publishing date for Mr. Obama’s memoir has not been set, and it is unlikely to be released this year.

Mr. Obama’s post-presidency appears to be on track with that enjoyed by Bill Clinton, the only other two-term Democratic president in the post-World War II era. In his first years out of office, Mr. Clinton gave multiple speeches for six-figure paydays, hauling in roughly $30 million from 2001 to 2005, according to financial statements wife Hillary filed as a U.S. senator at the time.

At times, such as the $500,000 Mr. Clinton received for one 2010 speech in Moscow, his post-presidential engagements raised eyebrows but they remained lucrative: Between January 2001, when he left office, and January 2013, Mr. Clinton’s fees from more than 500 speeches raked in an estimated $104 million, according to published reports.

By contrast, President George W. Bush has been subdued in the decade since he left the White House, giving few speeches.

Chicago’s South Side center

From a legal standpoint, the most troublesome project for Mr. Obama has been the $500 million Obama Presidential Center, slated to be built in Jackson Park on Chicago’s South Side, just below the University of Chicago campus.

The idea behind making “a difference in their communities” has always been a cornerstone of Mr. Obama’s political formulations and of his foundation, yet the project has become ensnared in fights with community activists and others.

Some Jackson Park supporters and community activists objected to the high-handed and unusual maneuvers by the City Council and the Illinois legislature to push the project forward, as well as the enormous footprint the planned four-building center will occupy on currently open public space.

An Obama appointee to the federal district court last week tossed a lawsuit against the project filed by Protect Our Parks and ruled that construction on the center could begin immediately.

Housing authorities raise concerns about Trump plan to evict undocumented immigrants,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/other/449065-housing-authorities-raise-concerns-about-plans-to-evict-undocumented,"Landlords and local housing authorities are pushing back on a Trump administration plan to evict undocumented immigrants from subsidized housing, according to The New York Times.

The proposal from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would ban households with one or more undocumented member from living in such housing, but housing administrators and landlords say it would put the onus of immigration enforcement on them.

Under the proposal, released in April, they would have to evict up to 108,000 people receiving benefits, most of whom, they say, are some of their most reliable tenants when it comes to paying rent on time.

“The housing authority would bear the brunt of the expense of having to completely evict and go through the court action of having to evict these families,” Sylvia Blanco, the chief operating officer at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin, Texas, told the Times.

“We would be on the hook for having to pay for that,” she added.

The plan would also require public housing administrators to verify the immigration status of every resident every year, they told the Times, as well as issue eviction notices and potentially go through court battles with individual families, according to the Times.

In Austin, legal fees and staff expenses would cost about $1,000 per eviction, Blanco told the newspaper.

In Los Angeles, where at least 30 percent of public housing occupants are households that could be caught in the crosshairs of the policy, the enforcement cost would be nearly $10 million.

“You can imagine, if you’re forcing the eviction of nearly one-third of these very large public housing sites, the impact that has on households as well as the broader community,” Doug Guthrie, the president and chief executive of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, told the Times.

Undocumented immigrants currently live with numerous families receiving housing subsidies, but the assistance is generally pro-rated according to how many members of the family are eligible, according to the Times.

“Most of our members are saying that’s a process that works,” Tim Kaiser, the executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, told the newspaper.

HUD Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonMoulton confirms he'll miss first Democratic debate Moulton confirms he'll miss first Democratic debate Lawmakers battle over HUD protections for homeless transgender people MORE also reportedly questioned the directive when the White House sent it, although he has since defended it at a congressional hearing, saying “this is common sense.

Mississippi’s Mental-Illness Policies Are Working. DOJ Is Challenging Them.,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['John Hirschauer', 'John Fund', 'Alexandra Desanctis', 'Andrew C.

The state is leading a quiet revolt.

Despite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services.

Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.

Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens.

DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C., which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.

The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.

First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:

“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”

Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”

This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that.

Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead-based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis, 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services.

The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment.

Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):

A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.

Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides?

Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for.

Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Olmstead highlighted the imprecision with which the majority used the word “discrimination” to describe Georgia’s decision to treat patients in “an institutional setting after they became eligible for community placement.” He presciently noted that “by adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this Court.” But even Ginsburg acknowledged an appellate court’s ruling that “the State’s duty to provide integrated services ‘is not absolute.’” States are allowed by Olmstead to preserve institutional settings necessary for the most severely ill, and the cost of preserving those settings may, in the fiscally limited world of state government, preclude those with less severe impairments from receiving commensurate services.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy warned that “it would be a tragic event . . . were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” This is precisely what the DOJ is doing. Mississippi is not a straggler to be dragged across deinstitutionalization’s finish line; the state is a necessary rebuke to policies that have relegated the severely mentally ill to lives of squalor and neglect on our nation’s streets and in our prisons."
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'June At Pm']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449176-critics-say-interior-top-lawyer-came-close-to-perjury-during,"A green group is requesting an investigation of the Department of the Interior’s top lawyer, arguing he downplayed his role in the department’s controversial public records review process while testifying in May.

Daniel Jorjani, the principal deputy solicitor at Interior, told senators he did not regularly review documents requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) before their release.

But a batch of documents released through a public records request from EarthJustice shows the confusion that stemmed from the policy and how Jorjani was involved in processing the requests.

“He misled Congress and stepped very close to perjury,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, arguing that Jorjani held back information from lawmakers who inquired about the public record process.

Interior has long been criticized for its policy of allowing political appointees to review FOIA requests about them or their work before being released to reporters and other requesters, including environmental groups.

In addition to his role in the solicitor’s office, Jorjani is also the department’s chief FOIA officer and employees were directed to copy him in their discussions of public records requests.

“It doesn’t pass the smell test to ask him to be sent all these things so he can not look at them,” Weiss said. “There’s clear documentation showing he has been looped in the entire time, so you can't deny that to the Senate in writing -- that’s just lying.”

Jorjani was recently nominated to be the solicitor for Interior, a post that has remained vacant under the Trump administration. Several Democrats have said they will not support his nomination in part because of his lack of response to questions on Interior’s public records policy.

“The Interior Department under President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says 'Failing New York Times' should be held 'fully accountable' over Russia report Trump says 'Failing New York Times' should be held 'fully accountable' over Russia report Trump tweets ICE will begin removing 'millions' of undocumented migrants MORE has treated information as a political weapon, regardless of what our laws require or what democracy demands of its leaders,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-A.Z.) chair of the House Natural Resources, said in a statement. “[Interior’s] top lawyer shouldn’t sign off on it.”

Molly Beck, a department spokeswoman, said “the process ensures that matters of concern to Department leadership are flagged for awareness. This also allows a FOIA officer to receive contextual information in order to help them better apply the relevant legal standards.”

EarthJustice requested an investigation of Interior’s public records review process from the department's Office of Inspector General (OIG), arguing it imposes barriers and delays in getting information.

Records requested by EarthJustice and included in their complaint to the OIG also answer other questions Jorjani didn’t answer in his testimony to Congress.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOn The Money: Pelosi says no debt ceiling hike until deal on spending caps | McConnell pressures White House to strike budget deal | Warren bill would wipe out billions in student debt | Senate passes IRS reform bill On The Money: Pelosi says no debt ceiling hike until deal on spending caps | McConnell pressures White House to strike budget deal | Warren bill would wipe out billions in student debt | Senate passes IRS reform bill Senate passes bipartisan IRS modernization bill MORE (D-Ore.) pressed Jorjani to disclose how many times Interior’s record review process caused the department to miss litigation deadlines.

In a written response to Wyden, Jorjani said he could not comment on individual litigation matters.

But a review of documents released to EarthJustice suggests there are at least three instances where Interior did not meet court deadlines because they were waiting for political appointees to review FOIA requests.

In a meeting in late May to discuss Jorjani’s nomination, Senate Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinThe Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by MAPRx — Trump takes heat for remarks on help from foreign governments The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by MAPRx — Trump takes heat for remarks on help from foreign governments The Hill's Morning Report - Trump and House Democrats resume battle MORE (D-W.V.) said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, Manchin said at the time.

Beck, the Interior spokeswoman, maintained that Jorjani’s role does not often require reviewing FOIA requests.

“He is responsible for providing direction to a FOIA program of over 140 employees working on a caseload that has increased more than 25 percent during this administration. In this role he does not typically review individual FOIA requests,” she said.

Other emails released from EarthJustice show Interior’s career staff were confused by how to process FOIA requests once political appointees were involved.

“What response is needed for us to release the documents? For example, several people responded by saying, ‘Thanks for sharing,’ or just ‘Thank you.’ Is that enough? Can I presume that we can release the records? Do I need to wait for all the people on the email chain to respond a certain way?” asked Clarice Julka, a FOIA public liaison for Interior wrote in April of 2018. “Right now, I’m holding up releases because I’m not sure what response I need to have before I can release. Should I continue to wait on these releases or should I go ahead?”

Later that month she expressed annoyance at delays and other issues stemming from political appointee review.

“It’s very confusing and I feel that we shouldn’t be responsible to read your or their minds about how to handle this since from the past, it’s been very clear that my office will be blamed for anything deemed to be a mistake,” she said.

Interior policy notes that if political appointees do not respond when notified about a FOIA request, it will be considered a green light to proceed with the request.

Despite that, numerous emails between FOIA staffers and other employees at Interior show employees were often seeking explicit approval before fulfilling FOIA requests.

But one email shows Interior Sec. David Bernhardt was hesitant to put his own approval in writing.

An email from a FOIA officer to Julka references a conversation with a woman listed only as Rachel.

“She met with Bernhardt this morning to discuss an upcoming release for litigation that is supposed to go out this Friday, April 27. She indicated that Bernhardt said it could go out then, but she also indicated he will not be putting this affirmation into writing and that if he said it could go out, we do not need to hear from anyone else. I explained that per my most recent understanding, we all need approvals in writing from both the comms office and himself. Rachel told me that was not going to happen this time,” the email said.

Weiss said such a move lacks transparency.

“It begs the question of what else David Bernhardt doesn’t want to put in writing?” he said."
Dems want to nuke DOJ policy barring presidential prosecutions,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-want-to-nuke-doj-policy-barring-presidential-prosecutions,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller said last month that charging President Trump with a crime “was not an option we could consider” because of the Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of sitting presidents.

Democrats are now talking about finding a way to change that.

“Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, recently proposed.

WARREN PROPOSES LAW SAYING A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED

And other congressional Democrats have since said they are considering whether the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel 1973 memorandum against charging a sitting president should be revoked -- though no legislation has been introduced just yet.

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told The Hill.

Another lawmaker, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, suggested that a measure revoking the policy could be included in some sort of spending package or authorization bill.

“I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” Connolly told The Hill.

While Mueller in his report said his investigation found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, the special counsel declined to issue a conclusion in the report about whether Trump obstructed justice through his comments and actions related to the investigation. The president repeatedly referred to the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and allegedly sought to have Mueller removed -- but he never did, and Trump has recently disputed that he even sought the special counsel's ouster.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said during his public statement last month, adding that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

After the release of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, but Democrats have argued Trump would have been charged with obstruction had he not been president. Republicans, meanwhile, have countered that Trump could not have been charged with obstruction since Mueller determined there was no underlying crime of conspiring with the Russians.

TRUMP CLAIMS 'OBAMA HAD TO KNOW ABOUT' EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE PRESIDENCY

The fresh chatter about upending the DOJ guidance amounts to the latest Democratic bid to reexamine federal policy toward alleged wrongdoing of sitting presidents.

Last month, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats introduced the “No President Is Above the Law Act.” The sponsors said in a news release at the time that it would pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president and “ensure that presidents can be held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American and not use the presidency to avoid legal consequences.”

""No person can be permitted to evade accountability for their actions just because they happen to be president,"" Nadler said. ""I have concerns with the Justice Department interpretation that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but if that is the policy, a president who commits a crime before or during their term in office, could exploit this loophole and avoid prosecution just because the statute of limitations has run out. This is unacceptable. The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.""

Even though Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, several Democratic presidential candidates are now indicating on the campaign trail that they would support a DOJ investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice if they win the White House in 2020.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said last week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said last week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

Trump, during an interview that aired Sunday night on ABC News, denied being worried about being prosecuted once he leaves office.

“Did nothing wrong,” Trump said. “There was no collusion.”

In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City. Utahns should hope they can be next,https://www.deseretnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900075743/in-our-opinion-the-department-of-agriculture-is-moving-workers-to-kanas-city-utahns-should-hope-they-can-be-next-blm-usda.html,"Utah is still waiting to see whether the Trump administration decides to move its Bureau of Land Management headquarters here from Washington — a move that makes sense considering how most BLM decisions affect the West much more than any property along the Potomac.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."

(WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together.

EPA will allow use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448970-epa-will-allow-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Monday it will allow states to use a pesticide that is harmful to bees.

The agency made an emergency exception for 11 states to use sulfoxaflor on cotton and sorghum crops.

“The only emergency here is the Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this dangerous bee-killing pesticide,” Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s sickening that even amid the current insect apocalypse, the EPA’s priority is protecting pesticide industry profits.”

A study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the emergency declaration has been used for four consecutive years in most of the states.

Sulfoxaflor’s use was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, but the EPA in 2016 changed its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the impact on bees. Cotton and sorghum were not included in the directive.

The EPA’s Office of Inspector General wrote in a report last year that the agency did not have processes in place to determine how its emergency measures impact human and environmental health.

An EPA spokesperson said the emergency exemption was granted with public safety in mind, as well as the needs of farmers.

""This decision is based in part on information from the states demonstrating an urgent need and a lack of available alternatives to address the pest pressures within their states. Mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize exposure and reduce the potential for unreasonable risks to the environment. The approvals include advisory guidance for protecting bees, and users must also follow all existing EPA guidance for pollinator protection,"" an EPA spokesperson said."
Government watchdog to investigate US Interior cuts from Utah monument,http://kutv.com,['Brady Mccombs Associated Press'],,,,http://kutv.com/news/local/government-watchdog-to-investigate-us-interior-cuts-from-utah-monument,
DOJ lost track of dozens of foreign nationals in US to help law enforcement,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-lost-track-of-dozens-of-foreign-nationals-in-u-s-to-help-law-enforcement,"A government watchdog investigation revealed the Justice Department lost track of dozens of foreign nationals who were brought to the U.S. and allowed to stay in the country to assist law enforcement.

The audit conducted by the DOJ’s inspector general, which spanned the end of the Obama administration and the beginning of Trump’s presidency, found that 62 of these foreign nationals had “absconded from DOJ control” and hundreds more weren’t being monitored properly.

DOJ sponsors the immigration of thousands of foreign nationals who might otherwise be inadmissible to the U.S. “due to their association with criminal enterprises.”

The new report, which scrutinized these DOJ immigration sponsorship programs, said these foreign nationals are useful to law enforcement because of “their access to criminal enterprises and ability to provide testimony in support of prosecution.” But there are “significant risks” involved as well, the report said, because the people in question “may be associated with criminal activity and motivated by the ability to reside temporarily in the United States.”

In addition to losing track of 62 foreign nationals, the audit also uncovered 18 instances where DOJ either didn’t renew or terminate their sponsorship of a foreign national properly “and therefore let the foreign nationals fall into an illegal status while residing in the United States.” The report said mistakes like that could result in “unnecessary, unexpected, and costly deportation of foreign nationals for whom DOJ had a continued need” and that the screw-ups could have “serious consequences for the investigations they were assisting.”

The Justice Department is supposed to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security in these sponsorship efforts, but the report described the DOJ’s faulty reporting mechanisms and poor communication with the DHS on this issue. The DOJ reported sponsoring 5,496 foreign nationals between fiscal 2015 and 2017, but the inspector general “identified over 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals for whom DHS did not have current information” as of February 2018. According to the report, “DHS was still seeking information regarding 665 sponsorships” in August.

The two most common tools the DOJ uses in its sponsorship are the significant public benefit parole and deferred action. That type of parole permits a foreign national to enter the U.S. and stay on temporarily while being sponsored by law enforcement, while deferred action delays the deportation of a foreign national who isn’t in the U.S. legally. Two other types of sponsorship are S Visas, which allow foreign nationals to reside in the U.S. for three years while they cooperate with authorities on complex cases, and PL-110 sponsorship, which gives permanent legal residency to foreign nationals assisting in matters of national security overseas. Both of these are relatively rare.

The Drug Enforcement Agency and the FBI, which sponsored 2,380 foreign nationals and 3,059 foreign nationals during this time frame, respectively, are the DOJ agencies most heavily involved in the programs working with foreign nationals.

The DEA used parole 1,331 times and deferred action 1,033 times during this period, while the FBI used SPBPs 1,552 times and deferred action 1,433 times. The report said that “both ATF and FBI had policies that require the sponsoring special agent to immediately notify headquarters when a foreign national absconds” but that “there were no redundant methods to ensure that an absconsion is addressed immediately.”

“DOJ components must be vigilant in exercising their responsibilities for overseeing sponsored foreign nationals to fulfill their obligations to DHS, to protect the public, and to achieve their objectives of furthering investigations and prosecutions,” the inspector general report declared. “Therefore, effective oversight of these programs is essential.”

DOJ spokesman Alexei Woltornist told the Washington Examiner that “the Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

This isn’t the first time that problems like this have been uncovered inside the DOJ. A separate Justice Department inspector general investigation into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives back in March 2017 revealed that the ATF “could not provide an accurate total number of ATF-sponsored foreign national informants.”

"One-Quarter Of U.S. Soybean Crop Remains Unplanted, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/one-third-of-us-soybean-crop-remains-unplanted-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. soybean is slightly more than three-fourths planted, while the corn crop is emerging nearly 20% slower than its five-year average.



Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 92% complete, behind the 100% five-year average.

The planting rate is equal to what the trade had expected. This leaves about 7.0 million acres left to be planted.

As of Sunday, Ohio farmers had 68% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 100% five-year average. South Dakota farmers have 78% of their corn seeded, behind a 100% five-year average.

Also, 79% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 97% five-year average.

In its report, the USDA pegged the corn crop as in 59% good/excellent condition, equal to a week ago.

Soybeans

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. soybean planting completion rate at 77% vs. a 93% five-year average. This leaves about 18.0 million acres of soybeans left to be planted.

Indiana and Illinois are the two major soybean-producing states well behind in planting completion with 64% and 70% respectively.

Also, 55% of the U.S. soybean crop has emerged vs. 84% five-year average.

Wheat

The USDA pegged the U.S. winter wheat harvest at 8% complete vs. a 20% five-year average."

DHS data breach should be taken seriously,https://www.bostonherald.com,"['Boston Herald Editorial Staff', 'Dhs Data Breach Should Be Taken Seriously - Svpn']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/06/17/dhs-data-breach-should-be-taken-seriously/,"Security technology is on the verge of changing the world. In what particular way it does that may be decided by our ability to keep data secure and out of the hands of cyberattackers.

There have been some recent stumbles on the part of government agencies. Earlier this year, the Homeland Security Department announced that FEMA had released the personal information of 2.3 million hurricane and wildfire survivors to a contractor. That information, in the wrong hands, could certainly be used for large-scale identity fraud.

This week, Customs and Border Protection issued a statement explaining that biometric information — photos of faces and license plates — had been exposed in a cyber attack. The information was sitting on a contractor’s server at the time.

A Customs spokesman indicated that the images involved fewer than 100,000 people, according to The Associated Press, but that number is not small and lives could be terribly affected.

Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the breach underscores the need for both federal and state moratoriums on government use of the technology.

“Once your face is leaked in a data breach like this, it can be weaponized against you for the rest of your life,” Crockford said. “If the attackers can mock up a fake image of you based on these leaked data, they can impersonate you and potentially break into your private accounts. If your password is hacked in a data breach, you can change it. But you can’t change your face.”

Sen. Ed Markey has called on DHS to halt the expansion of its biometric program until there were safeguards in place. Likewise, so has Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Until the Department of Homeland Security can adequately prove that they can secure the personal information of Americans, the expansion of the biometric program should be halted."
State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

US Treasury yields steady ahead of Federal Reserve meeting,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/17/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"U.S. government debt yields held steady on Monday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision later in the week.

At around 2:19 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slipped to 2.08%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 2.577%.

Market focus began the week centered on the Fed's upcoming policy decision and public comments, with many expecting the U.S. central bank to hold its overnight lending rate steady ahead of a cut in July. Lackluster inflation, modest economic growth expectations and a partial inversion of the yield curve are expected to pressure Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues toward reducing borrowing costs.

But the timing of any Fed rate cut, the first in more than a decade, remains a matter of debate. While some suspect the Fed to reduce interest rates in June or July after May's weak jobs data and softer consumer price index print, others are betting it waits until September to consider more data first.

Still, economists believe the Fed to hint at any future plans to reduce rates through the so-called ""dot plot,"" a chart that anonymously reflect each official's rate forecast.

Expectations for an upcoming rate cut have kept pressure on yields, with the 2-year Treasury note rate down nearly 40 basis points over the last month to 1.87% from 2.23%. Long-term rates like that of the 10-year Treasury note have touched multiyear lows in recent weeks amid equity volatility and demand for fixed-income assets."
"For U.S. presidents, poker is a main event",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Norman Chad', 'Norman Chad Writes A Syndicated Sports Humor Column.']",06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/for-us-presidents-poker-is-a-main-event/2019/06/16/7a1a5e54-8fb1-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"Columnist

We are in the midst of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, with the world championship $10,000 buy-in Main Event beginning July 3, and in its 50th year this annual festival dwarfs the World Series of Baseball in one very unmistakable manner:

The World Series of Poker is a true world series.

Baseball’s alleged World Series is the championship of the United States and Toronto. The WSOP Main Event is the championship of the world — last year, 83 nations were represented, with 2,116 of the 7,874 entrants from outside the U.S.

Frankly, I would argue — and I am arguing — that in addition to having a great international presence, poker is more of an American game than baseball.

You need look no further than the White House.

Many, many presidents played poker as adults before, during and after their administrations. Of course, no presidents have played adult baseball — though George W. Bush was part-owner of the Texas Rangers for a while — and the only MLB presidential activity is the occasional “throwing out the first pitch” at a game after sometimes getting booed.

Let’s kick-start this column by listing four presidential poker facts — well, three facts and one falsehood. You have to pick the imposter!

(a) Richard Nixon loved playing in the Navy, winning enough to help finance his first congressional campaign.

(b) Rutherford B. Hayes built a “man cave” of sorts on the South Lawn, where he played a Friday night game when Congress was in session.

(c) Dwight Eisenhower loved playing in the Army, winning enough to pay for an engagement ring for Mamie.

(d) Warren Harding liked playing twice a week in office and reputedly once lost an entire set of White House china on a poker bet.

The falsehood? It is (b) — Hayes didn’t even own a deck of cards; well, his wife did.

(Usual disclosure: I have been the “color commentator” for ESPN’s World Series of Poker telecasts since 2003 despite knowing very little about poker or broadcasting, joined by my partner Lon McEachern, who also knows very little about cards or TV. We are proof you can fail upward in America, or get elected.)

Among the other presidents who played poker were Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Barack Obama.

Harding’s advisers played so often with the boss, they were known as the “Poker Cabinet.”

FDR played a regular nickel-ante game in the White House study. His favorite stud games were one-eyed jacks wild and “Woolworth’s,” in which fives and tens were wild.

(Note to readers — or to my reader — under the age of 30: Woolworth’s was a “five-and-dime” department store in the 20th century.)

Truman’s motto, “The buck stops here,” was actually a poker expression; in the 19th century, hunting knives with buckhorn handles were used as the dealer button.

On March 4, 1946, Truman and Winston Churchill played poker on the presidential train en route to Fulton, Mo. Churchill had five Scotches before the game even began, lost $250 and gave up at 2:30 a.m. — he needed to sober up for his famous Iron Curtain speech the next day and needed to sober up for the Cold War.

Which reminds me — in 1271, Kublai Khan’s chief of staff check-raised the emperor at a home game, and the poor sap was working port authority at the Black Sea within a week.*

(*This is probably a falsehood.)

Our current POTUS, Donald Trump, does not play poker. But he created the U.S. Poker Championship for his Trump Taj Mahal casino in 1998, another one of his myriad business failures, held annually until 2010.

As part of ESPN’s coverage of the event in 2006, Trump offered “Trump’s Power Tips” coming out of commercial breaks.

Here was one of them:

“When somebody challenges you, fight back. Don’t let them push you around. Don’t be a sucker. Fight back 10 times harder than they ever thought. Guess what? They’ll never play games with you again.”

I guess he wasn’t bluffing.

No Reason Given by Governor After DHS Director Dismissed,https://whotv.com,['Dave Price'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://whotv.com/2019/06/17/no-reason-given-by-governor-after-dhs-director-dismissed/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DES MOINES, Iowa -- One state department leader will now oversee two separate agencies after Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds asked Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven to resign Monday.

Gerd Clabaugh, currently the director of the Department of Public Health, will also serve as interim DHS according to a news release from the governor. The statement read:

“Gerd has done an incredible job at the Department of Public Health and is well positioned to lead the Department of Human Services. He will play a very important role in implementing my vision for an integrated, compassionate, and coordinated health care system.”

Foxhoven served almost exactly two years in the position and was tasked with improving the state's switch to turn over management of Medicaid delivery services to private companies. That switch, which began under former Governor Terry Branstad with a pledge to save the state hundreds of millions of dollars, has faced numerous complaints of reduced services to the low income, elderly and disabled Iowans Medicaid serves, as well as criticism from providers who say it takes too long to get paid and that they don't always get reimbursed for their services.

Foxhoven release a brief statement regarding his resignation:

“At the Request of the Governor, I submitted my resignation. It was an honor to serve Iowans at the Department of Human Services during an important time of transition. I wish the many hard-working employees at the Department the very best and know that they will continue to serve the people of Iowa well.”

The governor provided no reason for dismissing Foxhoven and didn't mention the pending announcement to reporters during an event in Des Moines Monday morning, three hours before her office sent out the news release regarding the change.

Reynolds left the state to attend a meeting North Carolina scheduled for Tuesday.

Her staff also did not provide a reason for Foxhoven's departure."
"As it plans LEO constellations, DoD must prepare to deal with congestion",https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spacenews.com/on-national-security-as-it-plans-leo-constellations-dod-must-prepare-to-deal-with-congestion/,"“On National Security” appears in every issue of SpaceNews magazine. This column ran in the June 10, 2019 issue.

The buzzword in military space these days is “proliferated LEO,” which is Pentagon-speak for large numbers of small satellites in low Earth orbit.

The first project of the newly created Space Development Agency will be to design a proliferated LEO architecture and figure out how it can support military activities in space such as missile detection, communications and global navigation. SDA Director Fred Kennedy believes that within a few years, DoD will be able to shift some capabilities from large spacecraft in higher orbits to small satellites closer to Earth.

Now we’re hearing that the National Reconnaissance Office is likewise ready to jump on the LEO bandwagon to take advantage of lower cost satellites and cheaper launch services. With a proliferated constellation of dozens of spacecraft, the government can take more risks, says Troy Meink, director of NRO’s geospatial intelligence directorate. “You can have a higher failure rate and be able to deal with that. Losing two out of 10 is not as bad as losing one of two.”

With the benefits of LEO come concerns, however. One is the growing congestion and danger of not knowing exactly what is up there.

“This is not just a DoD problem,” says LeoLabs founder and CEO Daniel Ceperley. “Very few people are used to the large constellations.”

LeoLabs operates a worldwide network of ground-based, phased-array radars that tracks objects in low orbits. Its primary customers are commercial satellite operators, regulatory and civilian space agencies, and insurance companies. LeoLabs does some work with DoD, but Ceperley expects the military will become a bigger customer as it moves to deploy more satellites in LEO.

Everyone is focused on building satellites, launching them and making sure they can downlink data, but much less thought is being given to the actual operation of a constellation in a congested environment, says Ceperley. “That’s where there’s a lot of challenge.”

All this is manageable, he says. There are roughly 1,000 active satellites in LEO today. If the huge broadband constellations that are now being developed come to fruition, the numbers could go up to 15,000. “I think they can all be safely put into LEO. It just requires much better active management,” Ceperley says.

Given the pace of commercial investment in space traffic management technologies, DoD should have access in the future to more sophisticated collision-prevention services that will alert operators about potential orbital crashes. Today, there’s no collision prevention information available outside of what U.S. Strategic Command sends directly to satellite operators, says Ceperley. “There’s a lot of talk about rules of the road and best practices for organizing constellations, but it’s not based on a lot of data.”

For DoD, one of the concerns is dealing with maneuvering satellites that may or may not have malicious intent but still pose hazards. A lot of satellites are using low impulse thrusters so operators can raise fleets of spacecraft slowly up to their operational altitude and bring them back down to burn up in the atmosphere. “There’s a lot more maneuvering going on,” Ceperley says. “Keeping track of those maneuvers and feeding those into collision prediction services has been a challenge in the past.” He says LeoLabs is developing new software systems and expanding its radar network precisely to fill the demand for more intelligence about what’s happening in space.

The U.S. Air Force is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a Space Fence radar which is about to become operational and will help track much smaller objects than now possible. But that is not going to be enough to cope with the clutter and the proliferation of space junk, says Ceperley. DoD’s exquisite sensors are valuable for some activities but the military will need additional help keeping tabs on commercial activity and where the debris is going.

DoD today does not have enough sensors to adequately monitor the congestion in LEO, he says. If several dozen satellites are launched at one time, at least 10 or 20 will go untracked for weeks.

Those issues are going to become a bigger problem for the military and the intelligence community as LEO becomes more populated.

Secretary of State Pompeo Wants to 'Unite' the World Over Alleged Iran Attacks,https://time.com,['Ellen Knickmeyer'],,,,https://time.com/5608030/mike-pompeo-iran-attacks/,"(WASHINGTON) — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reaching out to wary foreign leaders to frame alleged Iranian attacks in a Middle East oil shipping route as a problem for the world at large, especially for Asian countries vitally dependent on that oil.

Pompeo, in a series of Sunday television interviews, emphasized the U.S. international outreach in the wake of what the U.S. says were Iranian attacks Thursday on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz.

“I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday. I’ll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite,” Pompeo said. He did not say what kind of action the Trump administration envisioned.

“We are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that,” Pompeo said.

That echoed comments from acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan this past week when he said the U.S. goal is to “build international consensus to this international problem.”

Iran has denied being involved in the attacks and accused America of promoting an “Iranophobic” campaign against it.

Pressed on whether any new U.S. military deployment to the region was possible, Pompeo said that “of course” remained among the options that President Donald Trump may consider to keep shipping safe through the narrow strait, a strategic choke point for oil shipments from the Middle East.

Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from an international agreement, signed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has reinstated economic sanctions and recently ended waivers that allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil. That has deprived Iran of oil income and has coincided with what U.S. officials said was a surge in intelligence pointing to Iranian preparations for attacks against U.S. forces and interests in the Gulf region.

The U.S. has accelerated the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group to the region, sent four nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Qatar and bolstered its defenses in the region by deploying more Patriot air defense systems.

Some European allies have called for a careful investigation of responsibility, worried that Trump was escalating tensions with a country he has long called a top U.S. enemy.

Pompeo stressed that the U.S. gets relatively little of its energy supplies through the strait, which lies between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says 16 percent of U.S. petroleum imports came from the Persian Gulf countries in 2018.

By contrast, about 80% of oil through the shipping passage supplies energy-hungry countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. Those countries have skin in the game, he said.

“I’m confident that when they see the risk — the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran, they will join us in this,” Pompeo said.

Pompeo said intelligence officials had “lots of data, lots of evidence” that Iran was responsible. Pressed for specifics, Pompeo pointed to grainy black-and-white footage already released by the U.S.

American officials say the footage shows Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from a Japanese tanker. The tanker’s crew gave an apparently different account, saying “flying objects” targeted the vessel.

Pompeo said the administration had shared the video and other unspecified evidence with Germany and other nations.

Asked if the U.S. had a credibility problem with allies worried Trump could be seeking a pretext to move against Iran, the secretary of state said, “We’re not selling anything. These- these are simple facts.”

Pompeo spoke on “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

Department of Energy grant to develop area's nuclear workforce,https://www.augustachronicle.com,['Susan Mccord'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20190617/department-of-energy-grant-to-develop-areas-nuclear-workforce,"Five area institutions are getting $5 million to better develop the area’s nuclear workforce and help meet a goal of producing 80 plutonium pits per year by 2030.

Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration in the U.S. Department of Energy, was surrounded by the heads of the five institutions – Augusta and Aiken technical colleges, Augusta University and the University of South Carolina's Aiken and Salkehatchie campuses – along with two U.S. congressmen and numerous other officials when she made the announcement Monday at Aiken Tech.

“As many of you know, our mission at Savannah River Site will be growing, not decreasing,” Gordon-Hagerty said. “The Department of Energy and NNSA are committed to this partnership and helping sustain the great work being done.”

The grant doubles the current annual funding for a regional nuclear careers program administered by the Savannah River Site Community Reuse Organization, which since 2016 has received $1 million per year to coordinate programs across the institutions, the NNSA said in a news release.

Workforce development is vital to the area’s mission, including the planned repurposing of the former Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility into a plutonium pit production facility, Gordon-Hagerty said.

“The plutonium pit mission, and congressmen (Joe) Wilson and (Rick) Allen have been instrumental in all this, given the president’s 2018 nuclear posture review, the United States determined that we needed to have a resilient monitoring structure for our nuclear deterrent,” Gordon-Hagerty said.

“We need to prepare to produce up to 80 pits per year by 2030, producing not less than 30 per year at Los Alamos (N.M.) and producing not less than 50 pits per year at Savannah River Site,” she said.

Wilson, the South Carolina Republican who represents the area, said he was “a cheerleader for the Savannah River Site” while Allen, the Republican who represents the area across the river in Georgia, said Wilson had worked through the night last week on SRS-related legislation.

While the economy is growing rapidly, Allen said, “it could grow faster if we’d trained that workforce.”

Coursework funded through the program includes radiation protection technology, nuclear engineering technology, process engineering, environmental remediation, chemistry and physics with a concentration in nuclear science, welding and others."
USDA provides opportunities for rural home ownership,https://www.kcrg.com,['News Staff'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/USDA-provides-opportunities-for-rural-home-ownership-511396041.html,"June is homeownership month and the USDA Rural Development office in Iowa has options for buying or building a home in small towns.

MGN

Every year, around 2,000 Iowans get help from the USDA to get a place to live through two low-interest and no-down-payment loan programs. There are income limits, but for families moving to the country to work in agriculture or helping develop small communities, the loans are needed support.

State Director of Rural Development Grant Menke said in the last 80 years the USDA has helped 4.4 million rural Americans with housing needs.

He says home ownership is foundational to small towns in enhancing economic opportunity and improving quality of life, which is the core mission of rural development.

""If you go across the state and ask people about what the most pressing needs are in rural communities, nine out of ten times you're going to hear housing and you're going to hear workforce. So we are very pleased to be a part of that solution,"" he said.

There are also opportunities for Iowans to build their own place with USDA loans. Rural Housing 360 teamed up with government agencies, businesses, and communities to offer several small floor building plans and get loans, putting new homes in small-town communities.

As an example, when Prestage Farms decided to build a new pork processing plant in 2016, they planned to hire nearly 900 workers who would need a place to live near Eagle Grove, Iowa a town of 3,500 people.

USDA loans could help those workers find a place to live.

Menke says he's happy to be a part of the solution addressing rural housing needs.

""And there's a lot of building happening in rural communities right now. You're seeing businesses, manufacturers expanding in a lot of parts of the state and that's where that workforce and housing, those dual critical needs come together,"" he said.

Immigration by the numbers: DHS has no idea how many people are entering illegally,https://thehill.com,[],06-16-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/448765-immigration-by-the-numbers-dhs-has-no-idea-how-many-people-are-entering,"Border agents apprehended 132,887 people trying to cross the Southwest border in May, a 13-year high, and many of the migrants were asylum seekers. The increased flow across the border has overwhelmed our asylum system. It has become so difficult to get an asylum application processed in the United States that some migrants are giving up and applying for asylum in Mexico.

But the Southwest border is only 1,954 miles long, less than two percent of the 101,471-mile border around the United States (6,000 miles of land borders and 95,471 miles of coastline borders).

And DHS seems to have concentrated its resources on the Southwest border. In fiscal 2017, there were 461,540 apprehensions, but only 3,027 of them were at the northern border and only 3,588 at coastal borders.

ADVERTISEMENT

Congress, however, apparently wants DHS to patrol the entire border — all 101,471 miles of it.

Section 1092 in the Fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires the DHS Secretary to provide congress with annual metrics reports on securing the border between all of the ports of entry along the perimeter of the United States.

The report must include the percentage of the illegal crossers who were apprehended, how many undetected illegal crossings occurred, how many migrants succeeded in making an illegal crossing but went back to Mexico right away, and how many were detected but able to get away without being apprehended.

The NDAA requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to analyze the suitability and statistical validity of the data provided in the report.

The Secretary submitted the fiscal 2018 Border Security Metrics Report on Feb. 26, 2019, and GAO released its evaluation in March. Among other things, GAO expressed concern about DHS's failure to systematically review the reliability of the data it used to make its determinations and to comprehensively identify and communicate limitations.

I suspect that such a review would just have revealed the futility of the project — here's why.

Apprehension rate

To determine the apprehension rate between ports of entry, DHS must divide the number of apprehensions by the number of unlawful entry attempts.

For example, if the Border Patrol apprehends 100,000 illegal crossers next month, and there are 100,000 unlawful entry attempts that month, the apprehension rate would be 100 percent. Every alien who attempted an illegal entry would have been caught. But if there are 200,000 unlawful entry attempts and 100,000 apprehensions, the apprehension rate would be 50 percent.

DHS has developed two systems for making this calculation, a model-based apprehension rate system and an observational apprehension rate system. See page 7 of the report.

The apprehension rate produced by the model-based system for fiscal 2017 was 65.4 percent, and the observational-based system produced a rate of 74.5 percent.

I don't think these systems can produce reliable information. If you don't know how many illegal entries were attempted, you can't calculate an apprehension rate, and creating sophisticated-sounding metrics systems doesn't change that fact.

DHS could do this on the land borders by installing surveillance equipment, known as a ""virtual wall,"" but an attempt to install such a system in 2006 was a complete fiasco. When the project was terminated in 2011, only 53 miles of the system had been installed — at a cost of one billion dollars.

Detected unlawful entries

DHS does this calculation by adding the number of ""turn backs"" and ""got aways"" to the number of apprehensions.

""Turn backs"" are migrants who, after making an illegal entry, respond to U.S. enforcement efforts by returning promptly to the country from which they entered.

""Got aways"" are migrants who are observed making an illegal entry but are not caught.

According to the report, the number of detected unlawful entries fell from 2 million in fiscal 2006 to roughly 500,000 in fiscal 2017, a 75 percent decrease.

Undetected unlawful entries

This refers to the number of migrants who succeed in making an illegal entry without being detected. DHS developed a system for making this calculation, but that doesn't change the fact that they are just guessing.

According to their system, undetected illegal entries fell from more than a million in fiscal 2006 to fewer than 57,000 in fiscal 2017, a 95 percent decrease.

Turn backs

According to DHS, the primary limitation to detecting turn backs is that it requires subjective observations from thousands of individual agents.

The report concludes that there were 91,998 turn backs in fiscal 2017.

Got aways

The report only mentions got aways that occurred on the Southwest border.

It states that got aways declined from 615,000 in fiscal 2006 to 104,000 in fiscal 2017, an 83 percent decrease.

Although DHS should provide the data needed to determine the effectiveness of border security measures, it won't be able to acquire it without costly surveillance systems that may not be feasible to install with current technology.

Until then, DHS estimates will just be educated guesses.

Goldberg: What would your—sorry to use a fraught expression from your White House—but what would your red line be for the U.S. to take action, military action, in the Gulf?

Carter: Well, the lesson I have learned from observing red lines over a number of decades and a number of presidents, including President Obama, is don’t draw them in the first place.

Goldberg: The first rule of red lines is don’t draw them.

Carter: Yeah, so I’m not going to do that. Unless you clearly see what the purpose is, don’t do it. I do think, were they to take any action like that against a U.S. military vessel, that’s top of the tier. Then you get U.S. flag vessels, of which there are almost none there—in this case, this is international shipping, but again, I think some action will probably be taken, like Pompeo said. But, you know, we’re in the very early hours now. As I say in the book, how do you manage circumstances like this? I was in office when we learned that 10 U.S. sailors had been taken prisoner or hostage by the Iranian military. In these fast-moving situations, you’ve got to keep your wits about you, and the first thing you have to ask yourself is, What do I feel safe saying? That’s why it took a number of hours, I guess, for Mike Pompeo—and he’s probably pretty careful about what he said about political and economic response.

And don’t get out in front of your headlights because people are screaming for you to say something. And the other thing is, you’ve got to give people some actions to take. And so it’s important that acting Secretary Shanahan and Pompeo are doing some things now. First of all, it shows that you’re alive and awake, and that’s important. Second, it gives your—

Goldberg: That’s a low standard for a government entity.

Carter: But I think otherwise there becomes a narrative of inaction, which is a narrative of not knowing what your mind is. Which is not the same thing as not completely knowing all the facts of a given situation. So it is important to say something, and it is important to do something early in the hours of a crisis, even if you don’t fully know everything, because you kind of have to fill the void.

Goldberg: You worked for one of the most disciplined presidents in history. And we have now, I think it’s fair to say, one of the lesser most disciplined presidents in history. Can a tweet, at this point, cause a move toward something kinetic?

Carter: I don’t think a tweet would be construed as an order, if that’s your question.

Goldberg: That’s half of a question. Can the other side misinterpret it?

Carter: Let’s just be clear. The other side, yes, these tweets are more consequential. Now, if you had to predict what kind of tweet might come out of this particular circumstance with respect to Iran, given the president’s history of tweeting on Iran, it’s likely to be softer than anything Secretary Pompeo had to say, and he already was only talking about political and military response. Now, that’s from the outside looking in."
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"
